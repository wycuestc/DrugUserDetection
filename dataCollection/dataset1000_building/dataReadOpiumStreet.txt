1^LilAzzid^chocolate^I also have a vague memory of shoplifting 2 chocolate bars but I can't find the wrappers in my car or anywhere else so I'm not sure if that really happened lol

1^LilAzzid^opiates^Most posts of that nature are made so people don't have to make the same mistakes. Getting hooked on opiates or any other drug isnt cool or fun it fucking sucks and every single time a person changes their mind about taking a substance from reading a post on reddit then that's a fucking win in my book.

2^Skinnyclown22^black^Oh that reminds me, I forgot to include the part where I tried to smoke a piece of rubber thinking it was black tar heroin...

3^tr8pK^dreams^something is trying to drive you two apart and it‚Äôs not friendly. i‚Äôve heard of people have parallel dreams, normally a bad omen

4^James2431^gum^Do you guys count gum? For me personally, I do a no calorie no sugar healthy gum to keep my mouth active and beat the urges

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5^nathanroot28^black^Yes they affect me similar to how they affect you. It like normal people are at baseline and get super dumb and fucked up but I already have crippling anxiety so lots of benzos just get me to normal and I‚Äôve never really gotten super fucked up even on large doses. Like you said it‚Äôs like being drunk. 

I‚Äôve taken LOTS of benzos before and never broke the law or made an ass of myself while other people I know blackout on like 2 Xanax and crash their car and steal shit. I‚Äôve forgotten things similar to how you forget when your drunk but I‚Äôve never black out and never feel the need to abuse benzos. 

They are ‚Äúnormalizers‚Äù to me

5^nathanroot28^black^When I did it I was playing black ops 2 and for a good 15 minutes I swear I was playing left 4 dead 2

5^nathanroot28^black^Oof üò£. 

I‚Äôve had the police hallucinations more times than I‚Äôd like. Once on a coke binged I looked out my window and it was fine, then I got a bad feeling in my stomach and went to look again only to see at least 3 fully black shadow cop cars and at least 7-10 cops all shining lights. 

Crazy shit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6^TheDarkSideSpoon^opiates^The Opiatechurch just looks like a place where people post pics of actual opiates in there hand..... ü§î

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7^drillyapussy^opiates^How do you come to that conclusion? Even as I child I've been interested in science, spirituality, the human mind and hallucinogenic plants. As a teenager I began the exploration on occasion (every 3-6 months).

Before I've consumed any drug I've researched it to the point that most people don't know. I used to be addicted to cigarettes but LSD gave me the motivation to quit as I could feel tar coating my lungs, stealing what felt like about 20% of my air, a horrible sounding cough and a weird not able to clear my throat feeling when I was tripping (it was more subtle but noticeable sober) hyperaware of the damage it was causing. Now I have a much reduced cough which doesnt sound that bad and only a slight need to clear my throat feeling and I smoke a lot of weed (I do use about 1 cig worth mixed tbh but that's much better than 10-20 non-water filtered smokes a day).

Besides that, I know what opiates do to people from research and seeing/meeting a few addicts out there. I've tried a couple out of pure 1-2x experimentation to see why people like the shit. Codeine was strong but gave me SEVERE upper stomach pain and spins, trams had no euphoria and slowed my breathing to an uncomfortable but non lethal level and oxy was okay, it had no side effects and mild euphoria and and a nod which caused realistic but boring dreams within seconds of me on my phone or something and the 2nd time my friends and I snorted some and we all became agitated easily and unmotivated with no other effects. 

To me they don't feel good nor serve any good purpose to my health or mind. To me, psychedelics are my DOC. I like things that are interesting, feel good, spiritual and useful. Being half relaxed to unable to leave the lounge in a boring but content way is not my style. I've got weed to feel good and relax me and it's much more satisfying/safe and it's got a psychedelic edge to it which I love.

8^kvothethearcane88^opiate^Subs have always made me lose my appetite.  I always weigh less when I'm on them.  It's kind of a problem I take mirtazipine to counter it.  But I  got addicted to subs not a full agonist.  When I was opiate naive subs would get me high for days.  Just crumbs of a pill.

To answer your question I'm on .25-.5 a day and it essentially feels like I haven't taken any sub.  Definetly a huge difference between this dose and a dose even as low as 2mg.

8^kvothethearcane88^china^Why are people always arguing against points I never made?  

The United States liberated Japan from a God emperor,  South Korea only  exists because of the United States.  Maybe I should put that in bold for you so it sinks in.

I never spoke on China.  Next time try reading what someone says, and then only take in what they actually said and not what you feel they said based on your assumptions.

8^kvothethearcane88^dreams^That is fascinating.  Was it a good life?  Did you love people and miss them here?  Do you remember what made them end?  I've had a few dreams throughout life where I was with someone I loved and I woke up and felt really strongly but couldn't remember anything about them.  Probably just some weird brain stuff but I remember getting that a lot when I was younger.

8^kvothethearcane88^black^And ironically black people have become the most racist race of all.  I have faced racism in open public by groups of black people.  Idgaf if I'm downvoted it fucking happened.

8^kvothethearcane88^opiate^Did you get through the w.d to oxy?  Like did u break physical dependence?  I recommend u get off subs asap if u feel like u can be disciplined enough not to relapse.  I've been on them for 8-10 years and they have left me empty inside.  I know it's the subs because of spent time off them and I'm a completely different person.  I'm tapering now and I'm about to be making my jump.  I'm at like .5 of a mg.  It's crazy how much body pain these things suppress.  I have new aches I never even knew I had.  But ya if u do get off just keep in mind the most fatal time for opiate addicts is their first relapse.  I know many people that have died after a stint of sobriety to just relapse and pass because they thought they still had tolerance.  It happened to me when I was like twenty.  I was lucky that it happened with tabs and not something stronger.  I had been off subs for a few months didn't touch any opiates then I took 6 tens like a dumbass...Cuz i used to eat like ten at a time.  I blacked out and threw up and passed out for hours.  My buddy was there so I was safe I guess.  I just slept in his room for hours while he watched tv.  Crazy part is I completely suppressed that memory and when he brought it up like a year later I refused that happened....he insisted then it all came back like wtf how did i forget an experience like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9^sowatifimadopefeen69^opiates^I mean yeah I suppose, generally speaking I think most people would advise you to steer clear of opiates.

9^sowatifimadopefeen69^opioid^What‚Äôs wrong with getting free fentanyl? Either you get an opioid buzz or you die either way it‚Äôs a win win.

9^sowatifimadopefeen69^opiate^Hydrocodone isn‚Äôt really that strong of an opiate which is probably why you haven‚Äôt overdosed on that combo. I‚Äôve generally found that alcohol + high dose benzodiazepines = blackouts and high dose of a potent opiate + benzodiazepines = respiratory depression.

I didn‚Äôt have a big tolerance when this happened and I took what would‚Äôve been equivalent to about 120mg oxy and 10mg Xanax

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10^krillepe^opium^Opiates shrinks the pupils, allthough alot, it also takes a bot of the edge away from the acid. Used to smoke some opium sometimes during trips just for the soothin effect

10^krillepe^opiates^Do it they are super reliable as well, they have one that  tests for opiates , cannabis, benzos and amphetamines and one more that looks for residues of other substances on a wider spectrum

10^krillepe^black^From what i heard oil paintings rarely do, aquarelle usually looks much nicer. Allthough it does depend from artist to artist as well. In color i dont think it would be too good but black and grey might just rock it

10^krillepe^opium^Dont take too much though, i used opium but i dunno how lsd reacts to other opiates. Since it doesn't affect the same receptors and so on i dont think it shold be a issue but u can never be too safe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11^gustawind^black^Well it wasn't ash, I guess I shouldn't have said it was completely cashed. The weed in the pipe had been completely roasted black but it was still there, it hadn't disintegrated

11^gustawind^black^"I¬†have¬†a dream that my four little children¬†will¬†one day live in a nation where they¬†will not be judged by the color of their skin,¬†but by the content of their character." -- I mean for being *the* poster child of racial equality in America, it seems that people don't give a fuck about these wonderful words anymore. That goes for black and white people. The civil rights movement and the following cultural evolution intended on making people of all colors and creeds equal. They weren't fighting for a switcheroo where black people would judge white people for the color of *their* skin. Hell I imagine that after going through all that actual prejudice the last thing you'd wanna do is inflict that same prejudice on others. I'd also like to think that those activists envisioned a world where their race and culture didn't need to be superficially "propped up", the way that I see many white institutions doing now as if to say "aww look at all the little minorities and their wonderful cultureeee" or "let us give you arbitrary advantages because you're *clearly* not smart enough to do this on your own based on your own character."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12^Void_Wanderer^opioid^Hmmm idk most substances affect more than one system in the brain including the ones you listed. ex: meth affects dopamine, Norepinephrine and serotonin system. Some dissociatives also affect serotonin and dopamine systems or even interact with opioid receptors, Not just NMDA.

Maybe "which substance is your favorite in each class" that would make more sense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13^3godtryptamine^black^fuck knows, google '999' and on images there's a photo of 999 written in white with a black background which he copied onto his stencil

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14^Rihfok^opiates^Oh I won't, getting it is a hassle for me in any case and I lean towards poly use rather than just opiates, excluding weed I usually take something once or twice before feeling like moving to something else in my rota, codeine thus far has been no exception.

Might indeed be as another comment said that I just don't metabolize codeine properly, since 200mg+weed wasn't enough to make me nod with no tolerance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15^DrizzlyEarth175^opiates^Felt this. This is me with opiates tho. Don't get me wrong I love stimulants, but opiates kill it all away without keeping me up for days fighting off the FBI agents from breaking into my house.

15^DrizzlyEarth175^dreams^I mean even if you excluded the part about your dreams, the fact that he stopped his truck to make eye contact with you is probably enough to at least have them create a report for the incident. That's creepy. Especially given that you were fourteen at the time.

15^DrizzlyEarth175^black^What's your point? The SS enforced under the guise that Jews were less than humans and should be treated as such. American police are not trained as such. In the early 20th century if you called the cops because a black guy didn't give up his seat for you, the guy would be beaten and arrested. So what? That was years and years and years ago. Things have changed. Comparing american law enforcement to the SS is what I would call grasping at straws. 

Who are we supposed to call then? Nobody? Just put up our fists and hope for the best? 

Maybe we should abolish the police. And create some kind of organized, trained group of individuals who are given the authority to enforce law and protect our citizens. Some criminals have guns, so these people would obviously have to come prepared, more prepared than the perpetrators they face. We could give them firearms! But criminals aren't the only problem, traffic violations kill thousands of people a year, so obviously we'd have to give this group their own marked vehicles, to get around quickly and to enforce traffic laws. Again, to keep people safe. 

See what I'm getting at? Police are a necessary part of any civilization. Some are bad, most are good. Do a little research and you'll learn that I'm not just some cop-loving racist twat.

15^DrizzlyEarth175^dreams^I hope this is true. I feel his presence sometimes. When I listen to certain music or go certain places. I especially feel it in my dreams. I had this dream once where I was with him and another friend (whom is still alive), and suddenly I realized I was dreaming and as soon as I did, they both stopped what they were doing and looked straight at me. I looked at him and said "you're here!" he nodded. "But aren't you supposed to be-" and he just nods as if he was expecting the question. I went to reach out and touch him but I woke up, probably from the excitement. I really want to believe it was really him, and he was really there with me.

15^DrizzlyEarth175^black^>dipshit with a notepad who doesn't know how to handle their firearm

Lol you're real fucking dense if you think cops don't know how to handle their firearms. Maybe some don't, but like 90% of them do. Have you seen that video of the homeless guy holding up a store with a knife and the cop uses a 40mm round to literally shoot the knife out of his hand? Cops have to be trained vigorously to handle their firearms, learn trigger and muzzle discipline, and accuracy. If you actually did some research instead of watching all the viral videos of cops shooting black people, you might actually gain some insight into the world of law enforcement. Think for yourself, don't be a sheep. Don't believe all the Twitter videos that have no context or insight done into them. Cops save lives. 

Some doctors fuck up and ruin peoples lives, do we have an acronym for that? ADAB? No. Because we know they are the vast minority. We just don't have a bunch of videos on Twitter of doctors botching surgeries. My childhood pediatrician literally molested his patients (and his own granddaughter) and had a toy on his stethoscope with a camera in it that recorded his patients in compromising positions (probably including myself). Do I think he's a complete bastard who deserves to rot in hell? Absofuckinglutely. Do I think all doctors are bastards who deserve to rot in hell? Absolutely not. 

But you might say "but cops are given guns and given the authority to shoot people! Blue man bad!" Doctors are given the authority to touch peoples genitals, nipples, see their patients naked. Surgeons are given the authority to literally put people to sleep, cut open their bodies, and manipulate their insides. Some of them fuck up. Do we bastardize them? No. 

Use your brain. Cops are humans. Some are racist, some are misogynistic, some are murderers, some are rapists. Doctors are humans. Some are racist, some are misogynistic, some are murderers, some are rapists. Same with lawyers, engineers, scientists, construction workers, that one weird cashier who checked your shit at walmart. My point is, cops are humans, like the rest of us. Some of them are bound to fuck up, to be evil, to use their authority to do wrong. And such individuals should be recognized and face the consequences. If humans are bastards, some cops are gonna be bastards. 

If you ever, god forbid, get into a serious accident and require CPR at the scene, and wake up to a cop doing chest compressions on you, I sincerely hope your attitude changes.

15^DrizzlyEarth175^black^I'm gonna get downvoted to shit, but fuck it, it needs to be said. Hard disagree. I've met some shithead cops, don't get me wrong. But I've also met some pretty great cops too. Cops that should've taken me to jail, but didn't. Cops that should've given me a ticket, but didn't. I agree police reform is an important issue, but I also think that saying all cops are bad is shortsighted, ignorant, and dangerous. Cops get killed all the time because they're worried what the public will think if they kill someone dangerous (especially if they happen to be black or latinx), innocent people die because of shit like this. People block streets, preventing emergency service vehicles from passing, protesting deaths even though the police took lawful action. 

Again, I've met a lot of shithead cops. The cop that killed Philando Castile was a shithead. That cop that shot that woman during a wellness check was a dumbass. Don't promote hate for law enforcement, push for better training for police officers, more sensitivity training for police officers.

16^TokenWhiteMage^chocolate^I mean it‚Äôs all relative. I‚Äôm sure for every ridiculous thing posted on here, there‚Äôs a notable amount of people who think it‚Äôs just the bees knees and can‚Äôt wait to shovel down a quadruple-layered burger stuffed with onion rings and pizza served inside a mason jar encrusted with chocolate and candy. 

So I stand by my statement that these are gross and stupid, but I don‚Äôt doubt that there are people who enjoy them.

16^TokenWhiteMage^black^But South Park mocks all sides equally, which is why they get away with it. This comic creator is very clearly punching down, as I said, at marginalized groups in society, because he deems them as lesser and thinks their lives are worth making a joke out of. Black guys can ‚Äúmake fun of‚Äù white people because they have no real power. The harm comes from the power imbalance between whites and blacks (or other races). White people are by and large the majority, and racist ‚Äújokes‚Äù can turn into racist thoughts, which turns into racist actions, which leads to things like institutionalized racism. It‚Äôs why we see black men [serving significantly longer sentences for the same crime as white men. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/) It‚Äôs why the [South Bend police force was gutted of its black officers after Buttigieg came to office](https://www.theroot.com/mayor-pete-s-invisible-black-police-1840727624?utm_source=theroot_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2020-01-08). 

The problem with these types of jokes being told by these types of people is that they‚Äôre not really jokes. They‚Äôre masking genuine thoughts, and making it seem like it‚Äôs just a harmless jest, which in turn fuels the same sort of thoughts in people that read it. I get your idea of egalitarian mockery, but this isn‚Äôt a representation of that. This is one guy being a dickwad and spreading his nazi message through seemingly-harmless webcomics.

16^TokenWhiteMage^black^Man I‚Äôm in my second week of my final semester, and I already feel myself falling into a black hole of anxiety and depression. Between constantly changing clinical paperwork, skills competencies, lecture material, and NCLEX prep assignments, I just feel so overwhelmed. Next week we are doing mock interviews and have to have a current, up-to-date resume with us, and I just kind of want to curl up and cry. Not to mention my personal life is messy and upsetting. I know it‚Äôs all temporary, and soon this will just be a fuzzy memory, but I‚Äôm just so...tired.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17^yaboynatan^opioid^Shit like this makes me sad because I still live in a country where weed is illegal. And you guys get the opioid dispensers.....

17^yaboynatan^black^You laugh, but soon enough this will be a reality, just like in Black Mirror. I wonder how many of their predictions will turn out to be accurate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18^PRODUCTIVEstoner94^opioid^People have done this in my city in the efforts of curbing the opioid crisis. There is some evidence to suggest marijuana can be a helpful ‚Äúexit drug‚Äù for opioid addicts. That being said, I‚Äôd likely give out socks too since weed makes me cold :/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19^ariesbabeye^china^Same. Like imagine interacting with this student when he gets back from China. He‚Äôs tell everyone what he did there. And then BAM! You find out he‚Äôs hospitalized for having coronavirus.

19^ariesbabeye^black^I‚Äôm white and this hurts me to read. Everyone is human no matter what color. I can‚Äôt for the life of me understand the psychology of why some think different races of people are lesser. It makes me feel ashamed to be a white person because racism is very common amongst my race sadly. You shouldn‚Äôt hate being black because your not the one degrading other human beings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20^1161Bartosz^dreams^ I lucid dream a lot, and one thing I can tell you it doesn't mean shit. Bad dreams happen, I loose control over aspects of my dream very often. Analysing dreams is a very hard thing to do. Science hasn't even understood what dreams are for yet. Don't think about it, a bad dream aspect can be created by a simple unpleasant experience from the past few days, even an unconscious one.

21^tracheotomyman^black^definetly. Makes me manic. Unable to control the switch between emotions, no fluidity, totally black and white and spotty

21^tracheotomyman^opiate^never taken an opiate in my life i used to shit fine before dxm but when your stopped up for 4 days you gotta do what you gotta do i been off the shit for a long time too just one delsym bottle and im clean otherwise

23^FoIds^china^Anyone have leaked footage related to crematoriums, riots, etc in Wuhan or elsewhere in China?

23^FoIds^black^Tapering should technically be easier to endure but for me it just makes the process take longer and feel too drawn out. I'll be quitting on Tuesday, CT. I'll be in an isolated cabin mostly alone for the next two months, not having to work, which will be great and makes things a hell of a lot easier. Dose as of late hasn't been too crazy, averaging 10-15 GPD. My plan when I quit in a few days is to lift weights every morning, take NAC, L-Tyrosine, Magnesium. Any supplements you would recommend? I think I'll go buy some CBD, 5-HTP or Tryptophan, Black seed oil If I can find it, also plan on eating as clean as possible. I applaud you on 35 days, no easy feat taper or not, be proud of yourself!

23^FoIds^opioid^Wouldn‚Äôt use a drug that has one of the worst opioid withdrawals there is to get off Kratom lol. Then you risk getting addicted to sub too which wouldn‚Äôt be good

23^FoIds^opiate^Day 1 coming to an end here soon. Feel better then normal today, I‚Äôm smoking weed during the WD cause I‚Äôve never had a problem with weed and can stop it whenever. Kratom and any opiate is a different story lol otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be here. Quitting vaping/nicotine too, just had my last hit an hour ago. It‚Äôs not gonna be easy but it‚Äôs gonna be worth it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24^JeSuisLaBanane^opiates^Thank you so much for your condolences! I may not have been the perfect brother but when I go to sleep i night I know that I was the best brother I could have been. So proud of you for being able to stay away from the opiatesüôèüèº

24^JeSuisLaBanane^opiates^Dude I really appreciate that more than you know. I posted this here because I know he loved this thread. If someone reads this and it gives them motivation to get clean that‚Äôd be ducking great. If someone reads this and it reminds them to be careful with powerful opiates and never use alone it is just as good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25^goodNonEvilHarry^black^IN this case she woudn't give me the same level of understanding that is implicitly asked for by her. I didn't know Twin Peaks was such sensitive topic. I try to be nice and thats what I get.  Another commenter said i was transphobic. The way i vote would suggest otherwise but if there is  continual misunderstandings, the best course of action is avoidance. 

It isn't hate. it isn't fear. it is just the best thing for everybody involved. YOu know how I manage to treat black with respect? I treat them like everybody else. That doesn't always work with trans people. If i treat them  iike everybody else , they won't be  trans anymore. They will be the gender i perceive them as. Does that make sense? . The thing is, I am not going to run around hating trans people. If I run into another one today i doubt the conversation would much more than hello thank you goodbye. 

I am going vote pro LGBTQ and i am taking my business away from that store. I tried to funny. i didn't want to be taken too seriously. It was funny. I didn't know david duchovny  was in twin peaks.

25^goodNonEvilHarry^black^county jail turned me into  a racist.  It's just county. It aint supposed to be hard. Black guy comes in the cell , sits on my bed, steals my soap. Ain't no white guy doing that shit.  OH, now you are going to masturbate in front of me,  in  broad day light?   


I try to remember that those are not representative of all black people. 

PRison, jails, they don't have to be that bad. The people inside make prisons bad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26^totallynotaburnerha^opiates^You‚Äôll be fine. Take some Advil or whatever painkillers you have at home (do not take opiates). Try and get some rest. How long ago did you take them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27^McJamesius^opiates^I‚Äôve only taken a couple opiates recreationally (hydrocodone and oxycodone) so thats why im not gonna group it as a whole. Which again, is very strange. And the two drugs i‚Äôve been on in hospital settings (morphine and ketamine) did nothing. The ketamine was the weirdest one, cause DXM will blow my pupils up like its the fucking Fatman.

27^McJamesius^opiate^Good to know for next time haha My friends brother was showing it to me cause he was talking about how it helps him deal with opiate cravings but he just gave it to me so I took it too

27^McJamesius^dreams^All the hallucinogens i‚Äôve had are DPH, DXM, and K. I have had weird dreams after taking a bunch of Vicodin before too. I‚Äôm pretty interested in trying a psychedelic sometime, I actually am ordering some 1P-LSD soon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28^PatsyClinesDaughter^black^This is how I feel about my dog. I‚Äôm a bit biased‚Äî I love cats but I feel that it‚Äôs easier to make that connection with a dog, for myself. I rescued my Pit/ Mix on March 14th, 2015, and that was the day her foster mom came over to do the home check. 



I had volunteered on Saturdays at the Petco near my house because of Community Service I had to complete: 25 hours. Not bad. 

So what you‚Äôd do when you volunteered there is it would just be a circle of metal chairs set up, and we‚Äôd all sit there with the dog that we were assigned, and we would educate potential adopters/ customers of the store about the dogs. 

They were really relaxed there‚Äî they‚Äôd let me take as many cigarette breaks as I wanted, and they‚Äôd just let me walk around the store, which I‚Äôd do. 

So one time when I was walking around the store and I went towards the back of it, in the very back corner there was a woman with a medium sized tan and black dog. The dog‚Äôs nipples were about 2 cm from touching the floor/ ground, for the fact that at that time, (spring of 2015 but a couple weeks before I started volunteering), she had 9 puppies.  Anyways, I had went up to them and sat to pet Ginger and talk to her foster mom, Bobbie, and every Saturday that I volunteered after that I would continue that. 

I swear, it was written in the stars. Something made me go over by them the initial time and every time after that. 

For the most part when I‚Äôd sit with Ginger and Bobbie, Ginger wouldn‚Äôt even really pay me attention. And EVERY dog that walked by‚Äî puppy, adult dog, nice dog‚Äî she would bark and lunge *extremely* aggressively. To the point where I haven‚Äôt ever heard her bark that way since seeing her there at that Petco. And she‚Äôs always loved puppies, she still dies for them. 

So anyway, after a couple weeks of volunteering and sitting by Ginger and Bobbie, Bobbie said something I will never forget: ‚ÄúHey Patsy, you should fill out an application for Ginger.‚Äù 

And I did. 

A couple weeks, probably two at the most, after filling out an application for her, Bobbie and Gin came over for the home check on March 14th, 2015. I still remember it. 

After about 2 1/2 hours of talking and filling out some paperwork, etc., Ginger was mine üíñüíñü•∞üåªüí´‚ú®. She is the best girl in the entire world‚Äî and I know every animal owner says that. But it was funny because before Christmas of 2019 obviously, my Ginger had never really met a baby baby, a few month old baby. But my girlfriend Amber actually came over with her and my other friend, Jamie a couple days before Christmas and it was SO CUTE!! Amber has a 2 year old and an 8 or so month old, and when they came over Ginger had went by Azo, her 8mo, and gave him THE *Softest, most GENTILE* kisses in the entire world. Oh my God it was so so sooooo gorgeous. She‚Äôs just my life and my word. 

It was just so adorable to see her be so gentile with him, even though she‚Äôs always soo gentile. I love my Ginger Virginia!!!! 


Beautiful cat by the way, and it anyone actually read this far‚Äî thank you! Lol. üòÄüòÜüíñüíñüíñ

28^PatsyClinesDaughter^opiates^Congratulations on taking the first step towards recovery‚Äî wanting sobriety. I‚Äôm proud of you. And just so you know, there probably *will* be people near where your parents live that use (opiates).  It‚Äôs almost inevitable, even in the ‚Äònicer‚Äô neighborhoods. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you need to partake. 

Also, I personally have come to the conclusion that I will never be able to do/ use opiates or Heroin recreationally, or once a month, etc. 

It just doesn‚Äôt work, because the ‚Äòonly on Friday each week‚Äô, for example, turns into, *Grabs 3 bags Friday afternoon* for all of that day and that night.  

Then let‚Äôs say I have a 5/10 tolerance like I used to, well I‚Äôm gonna do a bag or a bag and a half and be fucked up, so that turns into me having a bag or a bag and a half left when Saturday rolls around. 

So with that being said, I don‚Äôt think I would be able to use without continuing my use. Unless that one time just showed / reminded me of how shitty using was, and how shitty my life was back then. 

To conclude‚Äî congratu-fuckin-lation on taking the first and one of the most important steps toward/ in recovery. I think you‚Äôll do amazing, so to speak, as long as it‚Äôs what you want and what you continue to strive for.

28^PatsyClinesDaughter^opiates^I don‚Äôt have a hard time with comprehension whatsoever. Not sure why you‚Äôre being condescending. Anyways, I agree. People places things.

Edit: I guess I worded my comment wrong. I don‚Äôt think that everyone is the same, is why in response to a different person I‚Äôd said that everyone‚Äôs different but I personally am 14mo into my recovery from H and very clearly I‚Äôm still on here. But here is different than opiates church, and even there there‚Äôs not much ‚Äòporn‚Äô pictures. 

Edit: Not many porn pictures *that I‚Äôve seen*

29^ty_mudlife710^opiates^A side effect of Opiates in general is constipation, some people get it bad others hardly experience any.
I'm at 140mg daolhh

30^phantosam^dreams^Ive thought this many times! it always amazed me how i can forget someones face and then see them perfectly in a dream. There are so many things kept in our subconscious that we may only access in dreams

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31^Monnie28^opiates^Thanks so much! I went to detox for 5 days in the beginning to get medically stable because i was doing benzos along with the opiates but after that I‚Äôve quit everything, no weed or drinking.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32^Jakeshinns^dreams^Well whenever I smoked I was the type that I had to get blazed, there wasn‚Äôt just no 1 hit then I‚Äôm cool. Food was killing me. Once I start to eat while high there‚Äôs no stopping, multiple bowls of cereal, processed foods, straight sugar and that was killing me. Honestly the only way weed could help IMO is if you do it at night after all of your responsibilities are out of the way, and if you only take small hits out of a bowl. Also if you can control your hunger, drink water, and eat healthy if you do decide to eat. Weed does block dreams though and make it harder to get up in the morning and from my experience dreams are crucial for self realization(once you start to understand and control them)

32^Jakeshinns^dreams^Wet dreams is releasing semen that your body doesn‚Äôt need. Could also be succubus which is a sort of demon that forms in your dreams and takes the shape of women (or porn) and causes a wet dream. If you don‚Äôt want them try praying for safe dreams and a deep sleep.

33^Reagent_Tests_UK^opioid^Smoking is less efficient than oral consumption as opioid compounds slowly break down above 100*C.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34^Rabid_Kiwi^black^It depends. My bud who threw caution to the wind and just chugged shares the same ideals as you.

But it is really about finding a balance and taking breaks. 

Take LSD you really want to wait a month in between trips. Do it to much too often and it loses its effect and harms you. 

Take too much thc and you build up a tolerance and have to stop it for around four weeks to get back to normal.

It only seems crazy to us because we are not around it. Were in Turkey and Napal and around the Black Sea, it is common known. Even used as medicine by some people.

I am guessing your teacher was big on say no to drugs as well. So he/she did not want the kids getting any ideas... ergo it is poison, it can kill, there is nothing but evil about it.

So no worries. You are correct it does come with some warnings around it, but it is in no way as dangerous as most of the other stuff on this sub.

34^Rabid_Kiwi^china^Will do good sir/madam. Sorry It took so long for me to respond. I saw your post this morning but I have the cold/flu right now so I swear I responded, until now when I check the thread.

Any who, My order has been delayed because of the outbreak in china. The honey was beeing\* shipped from Turkey, to China, to a slow boat, to me. But that has been delayed. I have it on my things to do that once I find the right dose and trip, I will come back and tell you all my experience.

I am not going to add grams taken or anything like that I think. This is because each jar, each batch has a different lvl of Grayanotoxins. ( the stuff that makes you trip ) So adding a g/BMI will in truth hurt more that it will help. The best thing to do is do what my doctor told me. To try one tea spoon, then increase it after waiting a week. Do this until you trip. Then wait a month and check the dose.

If you have the same experience then you will not have a tolerance problem. ( Because I plan on taking it once a month ) If it is much more intense then there is a tolerance but it is under a month so I will be safe. If it has no effect/decreased effect then experiment over. Because that means that the tolerance levels can build and stay over long periods of time, this increases the chance for od and dangerous levels of doses. Then you only want to use it once every six months to a year.

Because I am going for the trip and not the medicinal effects, the tolerance level is important.  Where if I was going for the medicinal effects the trip tolerance would be welcomed.

Wow bud this is really long sry about that.

TL;DR I will do it but I am not getting the shipment until march so it  could be as late as may before the trail is done.

34^Rabid_Kiwi^china^Man I use a cheap ass 50 buck echo. Like one of the worst thing people say not to buy. It works like a dream though. Gets about 9 smokes to a full charge. Easy to clean, easy to fill and dump. Ceramic heating/holding.  I love the thing. I have tried a few others that friends shown me. They wanted me to change all snub nose'n the little echo.

But man that thing hits and works. I know cheap china made, bla bla bla. But TBH all the others are made in china. Most likely at the same plants. I just ordered this other weird looking pipe like one from China as well. The reviews are mixed on it and it may only get three tanks per charge. But it just looks so damn cool, redwood and pipe shaped all that.

So don't feel bad. Just do what works for you.

35^Spanjeweg_8^black^The horse hasn't bolted, we can claw our way back to reasonable gambling levels. 

1. Shut down suburban pokies, no compensation. If a pub or club can't survive without pokies then that's their problem. 
2. Ban gambling advertising in all forms. TV, Radio, Internet, Posters etc. 
3. Restrict online betting to small wagers under $5 per bet and no more than 4 bets per day. 
4. Force any app that wants to trade in australia to declare their profits in Australia and pay proper taxes. No licensing fees, no dodgy accounting, no offshoring profits. Pay up or don't be in the market. 
5. Allow a minimum of 5 operators to run bricks and mortar betting parlours like the old TAB model. Except huge taxes for operators who must be registered tax paying Australian Companies, no offshore licensing fees or dividends. Full tax must be paid on profits collected. Why minimum 5, to keep the market competitive, otherwise we end up with a coles woolies model. 
6. Any organisation taking wagers or betting in Australia must have fully open books. They must show their real profit and loss statements and be accountable. 

Your never going to outlaw gambling, it just creates a black market. Just regulate it, make sure that Australians benefit from it and prevent foreign investment.

36^opiate_lifer^black^I started investigating the social panic the USA experienced in the 50-60s that is often mocked by modern media, omg did you accidentally bring home a communist in your groceries?! Type stupid paranoia.

&#x200B;

Only in reality, it wasn't baseless paranoia!  Soviet psy-op agents HAD infiltrated universities and Hollywood, they would operate out of almost every Soviet embassy or were recruited from Russian communities in the USA, even second gen immigrants.

One of these was behind almost every single "communist society" or "students for marxism" type group, at the head you had a literal propaganda agent who got their marching orders from the Soviets.

&#x200B;

To be fair most of the US citizens recruited were just idealistic fools, useful idiots, or were just childishly rebelling against the USA in some way. None of them openly realized they were basically pscy-op shit stirrers for the SU, and in fact many would vehemently revile many of the cultural and societal attitudes of the SU if they knew. The ideas and values the SU was spreading among academics were ones they would never have allowed to flourish in their own country.

&#x200B;

A lot of this shit didn't really actually come to fruition until the last decade, it took time to plant society ruining values. The hardest thing is I AGREE with a lot of societal disruption goals the soviets had like encouraging gay rights, the civil rights movement, interracial relationships, black power movements. Basically the USA at the time and in a way still is a powder keg just waiting to be set off.

 [https://www.ozy.com/flashback/when-the-soviet-union-tried-to-woo-black-america/62517/](https://www.ozy.com/flashback/when-the-soviet-union-tried-to-woo-black-america/62517/) 

&#x200B;

If anyone is interested I can produce more links even showing the SU was behind the nascent gay rights movement, very ironic when the SU was and still is VERY homophobic culture all the way to violence.

36^opiate_lifer^opiates^Right on a kindred spirit!

I think this is a big aspect behind the odd love/hate experience some of these opiates induce. Some people want nod and only nod, if you're not making them nod you're a waste of money. Some people love the energy etc.

I've always wondered if there was a concrete uniform reason for the different actions across the entire board, like you could just look at a novel RC opioid's binding profile and molecular weight and instantly know how it would feel subjectively on average.

36^opiate_lifer^opiates^Same mountains of studies and scientific evidence showing chronic use of opiates can actually worsen pain and perfection of pain.  True or not they are just used to justify sending dependent people to the street to die. FWIW i don't even like benzos, love me some gabapentinoids through.

36^opiate_lifer^opiates^She most likely did not let it absorb correctly, like just swallowed it. HOWEVER buprenorphine has a 10% oral bioavailability, so as a total noob she still should have been hit HARD by 0.20mg of buprenorphine.

&#x200B;

My guess is either she is a liar, one of those people who have atypical first responses to opiates(a girl who once wanted me to initiate her had a moderate dose of codeine had no euphoria and instead got morose, and was scaring me by saying stuff like she did not care whether a car driving by would slam into her and kill her :O)

Or she just claimed to take it and really pocketed it because she wanted to look cool but was scared.

&#x200B;

\*For those concerned that girl never used opiates or other drugs to my knowledge and is alive and fine today with child.

36^opiate_lifer^black^Go to a bay known for pirates or one of the free streaming sites and watch the first two seasons of Westworld the show.

&#x200B;

Kind of gotta spoil some stuff here to make my point, but it is a failing themepark about to go into bankruptcy populated 

SPOILERS BELOW

&#x200B;

androids programmed to interact with the guests, and the guests can do anything from rape, torture, to murder on these realistic androids. Well a rich man realizes the true value there and buys the park and runs it for the next thirty years. While the guests paying to come and act out their darkest fantasies is plenty profitable, it is revealed that the hats and costumes guests wear have bands in them that are downloading their minds and keeping copies in massive "hard drives" in the park and one of the top secret projects is creating a stable working copy of a wealthy dead man and they are close. There is also constant surveillance all around the park on quests in addition to the secret hat heads bands downloading their minds and thoughts. They even have secret psychological profiles of all the quests, we see The Man In Black given his by Ford and him reading it and its not flattering.

&#x200B;

Now google may not be able to create clones of the powerful and wealthy and insert them into society just yet, BUT it has a massive amount of data about who is thinking about or searching for what, even if you have no account they have a record of that IP and what it searched for and did online. What is google decides to monetive this directly? This is the world largest source of blackmail material.

Wanna know what world ruler jerks it daily to porn of black guys feet?!  Well you can for a fee!

Wanna know what this new potential hire is searching for? Eh its worth ten bucks, omg searches on how to safely IV heroin?! No thank you, best ten bucks we ever spent!

&#x200B;

And its just getting worse and worse and worse by the day, children are being raised for it to be normalized that machines with mics are monitoring your every word just for the convenience of being able to ask Alexa what the temp will be tonight verbally!

36^opiate_lifer^opiates^This post was inspired by years of interaction and listening to people gossip about others sharing their true feelings and man it was depressing.

&#x200B;

But then my mostly estranged sister(we are NOT estranged due to drug abuse shit like asking for money etc) my wife called her to ask her to get me to stop taking all these pills for my mood like the tiny amount of buprenorphine I take a day, they are even suspicious of stuff from the supplement section at walmart!! Hmm Vitamin D3?  L-Arginine? Magnesium Glycinate?obviously just subtle ways to catch a buzz!. These druggies are crafty!

My sister told me she knew I never quit taking drugs from when I was a teenager exploring opiates while escaping my abusive controlling parents. She told me this is why she tried to grab the entire pitiful inheritance after my parents deaths, I did not need the money which I would just blow on ordering crazy chemicals like phenibut, what is that some gay anus thing like poppers?

She then told me that I obviously don't love my child which I am the primary caregiver for 100% financially support, I only care about maintaining my own mood first. If I loved him I'd stop taking everything even vitamins and put the money toward dubious therapies toward his disability, I'd get 3 hell 4 full time jobs and not eat to get as much money as possible for treatments and not care about myself.(my wife btw barely does online work bringing in a few hundred a month, I eat nothing but beans and rice and food on the clearance rack.

&#x200B;

I broke down emotionally screaming and crying over the phone to the point neighbors thought it was a domestic, telling her how dare she who has told me only tell her good things she doesn't want to hear depressing parts of my life with my disabled son. Then she snarkily went OOOOOOOOOOOOOO look whose screaming and crying now, you're probably high right this moment which is why I was finally able to break through to you and get you to cry haha. This just set me off further.

I had been looking to her my older sister for emotional guidance and support but instead got sniped at just like my parents used to do.

She was also furious I got her daughter who was a blackout alcoholic spending $50 bucks a day at the bar turned on to baclofen, and her daughter said its amazing a baclofen a day along with a wellbutrin and she hasn't had a desire to drink or go to the bar in weeks but stilll has to for social occasions at work but she baclofen helps her moderate herself. My niece a major reason she wants to stop drinking is once a man took her home when she was blackout and she considers what happened rape, saying she woke naked on a bed and she realized she needed out of this life, which is a big reason I wanted to help her. My sister was furious I'm practicing medicine without a license and getting her daughter to order crazy(uncontrolled!) drugs online from sketchy drug dealers. She said let her drink herself to death, its what she deserves?!? BTW the wellbutrin and baclofen are RXed to her by her DOCTOR, he also RXs her clonazepam and gabapentin which my niece said she no longer feels any need for or desire to take but she will stock pile it for the future.

&#x200B;

This is also the woman who lost custody of her son because she hung herself in the garage and she was the only adult around, except for her teenage son who came home and found and saved her and called 911. This is also the woman who has had every drug in existence RXed to her for fibromyalgia, including fent patches and xyrem(yes RX GHB) and 80mg oxys back in the day and dilaudids and benzos and soma the list never ends. I helped her endless times like when her husband called me because she had been overusing her RXed amount of fent patches wearing multiple at once, then had a fight with him and in the heat of the fight she flushed all her pads and even ripped the ones she had on off. He said she just laid on the floor for days moaning and vomiting and emiting diarrhea at the same time and he did not know what to do. I helped her but she went to the ER eventually. She buys pot in a felony state and smokes daily.

But I am a dirty evil drug addict.

&#x200B;

My wife also hates when I take anything from a vitamin bought off the clearance rack of a health food store or anything else pill like vaguely, you should feel how you naturally feel if vitamin D3 makes you feel better thats unatural and wrong.

&#x200B;

I try to avoid my family, I became a digital nomad to escape.

36^opiate_lifer^opiates^Human weakness is fed off of by human strength, and I'm not being literal of course.

This is why communism on a size large than a family group falls apart, we're designed to play this game.

&#x200B;

edit: To make it perfectly clear I am NOT defending daily benzo use for anxiety, however here we are and a lot of people are dependent on their scripts. Stable, dependent and functioning for decades and ALIVE. Now if they are all yanked off cold turkey and run to street? Thats what I'm against.

Provisions should be made for those already dependent, as their lives depend on it. Just like with opiates.

36^opiate_lifer^opium^My guess is that gabapentin will become the new go to for generalized anxiety, until it too is scheduled and cracked down and around and around we go............

Pharmaceutical companies in the USA have been playing this game a LONG TIME, remember morphine was the non-addictive replacement for that evil addictive opium!

Then they introduced heroin to move the morphine addicts to and.........

36^opiate_lifer^china^Check out what is going on in China right now, they are arresting labs for selling caffeine powder according to the SARM subs. Some kind of far reaching legislation against providing chemicals in raw form or something. Illicit supply of anything is delicate.

You also assume potential consumers are as informed and sophisticated as posters here.

I mean in the recent past there are people including "celebrities" buying pressed xans that are really fentalog off the street, in probably the golden age of not only RX benzos but RC benzos too.

36^opiate_lifer^opioid^I tend to apply a sort of filtering method to these tolerance or potentiators of the day that I have seen countless numbers of come into and out of style, turn out to be bunk, turn out to be real, and everything in between.(I suspect there has been a LOT of guerilla marketing going on over the years if you catch my drift). Anyone remember when Cat's Claw got to the point of flyers up in methadone clinics?

&#x200B;

Whether the thing is worth trying is mostly based on cost, proposed benefit, and potential downsides like are there are reports of potential liver toxicity etc. If its cheap enough, or enough of a commodity, and has a high enough proposed benefit and no reports of downsides might be worth trying. But most of this shit is flash in the pan nonsense, or actual bad faith astroturfing. There have also been actual cases of methadone or some obscure opioid or RC opioid being found in these chinese herb blends that would make the rounds on the boards for halting tolerance increase! 

&#x200B;

There are a couple supplements I will defend with my life like vitaminD3 just based on cost, potential benefit, and subjective possibly placebo effect no matter what new studies come out and are touted by the anti supplement brigade. I'm not a total robot ;)

36^opiate_lifer^black^There is no worldwide monolithic zionist jew cabal working on a singular goal of world domination for thousands of years, thats silly and beneath discussion.

&#x200B;

There are however concentrations of jews in certain industries with wide reach and importance that should give people pause, and most of these groups have goals totally at crosssections anyway. A republican duel USA/Israeli citizen working high up in middle east affairs in the state department advocating for more middle east adventures to fight Israel's enemies for them isn't going to have much in common with a super liberal and woke atheist jew in NYC who writes articles about whether your cat is genderfluid or not.

&#x200B;

A few years ago I started paying attention to these bizarre almost social engineering propaganda articles about bizarre sex or family arrangements(It takes a true intellectual to enjoy watching your wife getting pleased by a black bull) and googling the author and heh yup jewish. The articles would often come out in bunches so it was obvious these authors had some discord or forum somewhere they were talking about and co-ordinating this crap that seemed designed just to agitate or rile up people.

I got bored of it when a really bizarre group of articles appeared advocating an insect based diet, googled the authors and well look at that. Amusingly the chick who wrote the article for VICE freely admitted she got really sick and ill on this diet for future plebs when she tried to live off of it a week lol. This came out of nowhere and seemed to be a floater almost testing what the public will accept.

&#x200B;

Variations on this have been floating around for years, not sure if this is the same one but once I actually looked into it and most accounts and tweets could be confirmed as real.

[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlNlUGxVAAM9m7r.jpg:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlNlUGxVAAM9m7r.jpg:large)

If you search #fellowwhitepeople on twitter there are tons and tons, some even further classified down like jews in X business doing this. Some is obviously faked but when the meme first appeared I out of fairness googled and was shocked a lot could be confirmed.

Then there is the jaw dropping things said in media intended only for jewish consumption, like the fact young jews outbreeding is a second holocaust.

&#x200B;

Anyway this has been your sick, anti-semitic, alt-right post of the day!

36^opiate_lifer^opium^Oral opium is my favorite opiate of all time, I have grown poppies and tried to harvest opium, I have followed and participated in long, long threads of others doing the same in a backyard context with one or few workers and always ending in failure or at least disappointment. Its a waste of time, if you want a heroin type nod an even greater waste.

&#x200B;

However! Growing and consuming papaver somniferum pods green or dried works perfectly and is both rewarding and will get you high. Warning withdrawal is horrendous for the high you get(which I like) just fair warning that trying to cold turkey pods is a quick path to fent or heroin addiction. Have subs or methadone ON HAND!

&#x200B;

The corporations that currently grow p.somniferum for the alkaloids just harvest the entire plant with machines at what they assume is the peak of alkaloid content(which varies like a mofo) then grind the pods and other plant material, they catch the seeds for sale to the food industry, then heat and chemically process the poppy straw to extract the alkaloids.

&#x200B;

Doing things the old fashioned way was more art than science in predicting weather top opium flow rate.. and required vast amounts of highly trained and otherwise useless seasonal work force to manually lance the pods and collect the opium after, AKA Afghani slave girls/daughters.

After this the "raw" opium was dried, manipulated, exposed to sun, and otherwise esoterically processed. It would be further processed and treated each time it changed hands from the farm all the way to the local opium den. Where the owners and servers often had their own esoteric processing methods and even pre-heating before it reached consumers.

Books have been written about this, there were entire industries making all sorts of esoteric tools like there is no in the legal weed industry. I've seen claims such as tests at the time showed some alkaloids did not even vaporize at the temps some dens were using, so some people might have basically been vaping morphine while others were vaping papaverine mostly or who even knows what. The mystique of opium involved a lot of social bullshit, just like alcohol does now.

&#x200B;

I have seen pictures of ornate metal opium den tools that somehow survived seizure and melting for scrap that modern scholars are totally baffled about its function.

Objects like below appear on the market occasionally:

[http://chinesesilverbox.org/2019/02/18/antique-sterling-silver-opium-chatelaine-tools-mystery-lock-box-rare-chinese/](http://chinesesilverbox.org/2019/02/18/antique-sterling-silver-opium-chatelaine-tools-mystery-lock-box-rare-chinese/)

&#x200B;

My advice? This whole period and way of drug use is gone and extinct and it would take industrial level activity to bring it back. However orally consuming pods green or dry is wonderful and gives a great subtle energizing high. My advice is to spread washed poppy seeds from PST far and wide near you, look up the correct planting time and they love disturbed soil. Just return and harvest when the pods are ready.

36^opiate_lifer^opiate^Will this be your first EVER opiate experience?

If you're a small body size take 1 pill, and don't combo it with anything get a feel for the opiate experience. If you have a large body size take 2 or 1 and a half for the first time.

&#x200B;

There is a limit to both how much codeine can be metabolized by each body AT ONCE, and over a 24 hour period. Those numbers you see for 300-400mg thats either a rare super metabolizer or a 24 hour metabolism rate.

36^opiate_lifer^opiates^edit

Some seem to be misunderstanding that in the billionaire reality there are no psychoactive drugs AT ALL, not just opiates.

37^not_combee^black^Ingredients: 1/2tbsp each of: tumeric, paprika, parsley, thyme, white pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, salt (I used red Hawaiian for colour)
1/2tsp of cayenne pepper. 
2 TBSP of olive oil

The potatoes I used were gold potatoes, and I soaked them for about 1/2 an hour to get some starch out (not that they're too starchy as is) and I baked them for 40 minutes at 390¬∞F shaking them halfway through

38^rainbowrider33^opiate^My opinion - up until recently there was little money to be made in studying addiction or treatment. Opiate detox was an unwanted burden to be disposed of as soon as possible. So there is a lot of guesswork. Almost all opiates are schedule II controlled substances and the perception is that doctors risk losing their licenses and even criminal prosecution for being involved in prescribing opiates. Our justice system needs some serious reform.

38^rainbowrider33^opiates^The question I have is, will you end up just substituting kratom for opiates? Personally, I would love to use kratom to get off oxys. I have tried kratom before and it did nothing for me as far as a high goes. But if I could use it to get through withdrawal and then just quit kratom, that would be awesome.

38^rainbowrider33^opiate^Imo NAD is a very expensive scam. From what I have seen, they talk about people feeling better after 5 or 6 days of iv therapy. The problem is, you are going to feel better anyway after 5 or 6 days, in most cases. Cost is between 5-10k depending on length of treatment. 

Ibogaine is the only treatment I have read about for opiate addiction that seems to cut out withdrawal symptoms and cravings. It is also expensive and you have to go to Mexico or Canada to do it.

38^rainbowrider33^opiate^I would definitely think you need to go more slowly for a long acting opiate. From what I have seen, if you take an opiate for more than 6 months you have a much better chance of avoiding relapse if you do a gradual detox.

38^rainbowrider33^opium^Heroin is never going to be legalized unless the problem gets much much worse. Marijuana had investors willing to lobby for years. No such luck with heroin. There is no money to be made and as such, no spokesmen to push congress to change the law. Everyone that matters (meaning cops, politicians and cartel people) have a vested interest in keeping it illegal. If the "opium epidemic" got bad enough, maybe it would be decriminalized. But as it stands now, that dog won't hunt.

38^rainbowrider33^opioid^What influences the amount of time an opioid binds to a receptor? Is that just a characteristic of that chemical?

38^rainbowrider33^black^I would bring in a really good chiropractor, that can test your muscles and tell you which ones need strengthening. One thing I have learned about PT and chiros, they tend to work towards the lowest common denominator. Meaning the exercises they prescribe are a one size fits all solution. If you are young and strong, you may need to bump it up. 

Yoga is super helpful. Not your grandaddy's yoga, but some of the more intense methods like hot yoga. Working on balance really helped me, because the same muscles in your feet and legs that let you balance are muscles involved in how you use your back. 

If you have already tried other stuff, my prescription would be 1. Intense yoga, 2. High doses of tumeric with black pepper and 3. A month of really clean eating.

A lot of people would tell you that you can never go back to tramadol and other drugs of abuse. I don't know. 

I would give abstinence at least 30 days. In the meantime, you can try other stuff if you want. You didn't mention anything about your diagnosis, but there have been many many people that have conquered their back pain with exercise and smart treatment.

38^rainbowrider33^opiate^I haven't had any interaction with addiction medicine docs in years, but I have to admit it always seemed sketchy. I am glad there are at least some doctors who are willing to put the work in to understand opiates. Which is the reason why I had to ask this question about tapering in the first place. There are some very well educated people that are absolutely convinced that it is impossible to get off opiates without that big kick at the end.

The theory that was presented to me was that the body cannot start producing endogenous opioids until the receptors are completely clear of outside compounds. So if you take even 10 mg of oxy, for example, that will set you back until it is eliminated from the body and whatever signaling process we use to manufacture natural opioids resumes once more.

I was told that this is what they teach in medical school, even though it is not really logical and contradicts many, many people on reddit, especially the numerous accounts of kratom users who have used that substance to get off opiates.

But as long as I have this opportunity to ask questions, I would like to ask if you have any experience with the bridge device (see link below) or electro acupuncture to suppress withdrawal symptoms? I have been reading about acupuncture and nerve stimulation of various sorts for years as a way to bypass withdrawal. But the one thing I have never seen is a credible opiate addict saying that they beat addiction by using this method. At one point I was so desperate that I bought a box of acupuncture needles and spent all morning sticking them into my ears in an attempt to obtain relief.  I also got a 9 volt battery and was trying to figure out the best way to pass a small current through my ears, but gave up before I managed to find a workable method. 

Any input?

38^rainbowrider33^opiate^Man, I really appreciate your responding. The thing with me is that I have been on opiates for several years and am now ready to get off. I was once on methadone, but for some reason, any sort of opiate seems to drain me. I don't have a normal amount of energy when I take them and I find it hard to do even regular life stuff like shopping or whatever.

I kicked cold turkey last year and stupidly relapsed. I am not eager to cold turkey again because it was viciously painful. But I am willing to suffer some to get clean. I think maybe this time around my sobriety will be more valuable for me because I have to work for it. And for me, the opiate high simply is not worth all the pain that comes with it anymore.

So I am passing on substitute opiates. I think it is the best decision in my case. 

I am pointing people to your post on tapering, which I hope is ok with you. There is far too much opinion and not enough actual experience on this topic.

38^rainbowrider33^opiate^The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few - unless you are talking about a very mild opiate that most people would never consider taking unless it was the only thing they could get. Politicians will do anything for another vote. I don't know how those people sleep at night.

39^BoatsAndAguerhoes^china^The logistics will have to change, the plan right now would be to transport equipment etc from China to Holland, that‚Äôs where the cargo ships will be going to, where the flights will be chartered to. All of that would have to be rescheduled.

40^thenardwrangler^opiate^>trying to argue that drug addiction is a "survival need" might be the most laughable thing you've said in this entire thread.

It's a reasonable comparison for opiate addiction. I actually got the idea from medical literature at my methodone clinic.  Opiate withdrawal is essentially your brain alerting your body that you are going to die if you don't get something asap.  

Yes, drugs are bad for you.  There I accounted for the damage done by the drugs themselves. If only that was the only thing I had to worry about.  When you're an addict people treat ya like a lot of the commenters in this thread are treating me.  Addicts and homeless people are subhuman in today's society.

41^youcantforgetthis^black^i‚Äôve yet to dust since living here so it‚Äôs probably collected up so much of it and just floats around constantly. i tend to wash my bedding weekly and vacuum almost every 2 days but if you mean actually cleaning the carpet with those water machines, i‚Äôve yet to do that since moving in.

i wish those hairs was just my imagination but i literally find those fibrous hairs and collect them on a tissue to show mother when i last happened. i was thinking of talking to a doctor about it assuming i had some hair ball stuck in my throat or something but i felt i‚Äôd sound crazy if i did. what‚Äôs happens is i physically feel my tongue being irritated in certain spots and then drag my finger nails in a pinching motion acrossed it and eventually black or red fibrous strands will be on my nails/under them. it annoys me so much i‚Äôve lived here for almost 2 years and it‚Äôs only happened a handful of times within the last 3 months.

41^youcantforgetthis^black^yo so i was just brushing my teeth and i set my phone down next to me on the counter and i look over after finishing brushing my teeth and right on the center of the screen is a tiny black spider. small than a qtip end but it was just there randomly.. pure coincidence or they actually out to get me.. i‚Äôve literally not seen spiders in months and have just now seen 2 different species in 1 day right next to me

42^pp15420^opiates^That‚Äôs true, but in my case i find the positives outweigh the negatives because i already feel so low naturally, even when i‚Äôm not coming off anything. Sometimes i even day dream about purposefully overdosing to kinda ‚Äúfinish what i started‚Äù. I feel i‚Äôve done irreversible damage to my brain and i‚Äôll always have this chemical deficit and yearning for opiates. It‚Äôs just so hard man.

42^pp15420^opiates^opiates dry out your mouth, causing bacteria to flood your mouth since theres no saliva to work against it. When i was using opiates heavily i got gingivitis because of it. Drink lots of water, floss and brush 2-3 times per day.

42^pp15420^opiates^i‚Äôve tried both. unfortunately ssris didn‚Äôt do much for me and I got myself physically addicted to benzos for a long time when i was 16. That was my first real addiction, and i was buying them off the street for therapeutic purposes at first, but it spiralled out of control very fast. I don‚Äôt think benzos will ever be a good long term drug to soothe anxiety because of how horrible the dependence becomes. I see you take them and i advise you to be safe, because the withdrawal was worse than opiates in my opinion.

42^pp15420^opioid^i‚Äôve heard dilaudid is very similar to heroin, at least regarding strength, and some opioid users PREFER shooting dilaudid over uncut H. I‚Äôve been told dilaudid / oxy is more ‚Äúeuphoric‚Äù than heroin. I also find oxy is quite stimulating in low/medium doses, unlike dilaudid. I found dilaudid was very sedating, so i assume heroin is the same. Theres a reason they call it ‚Äúdown‚Äù.

43^RusselDunbar^black^Thank you for your compliment! I take it as a compliment you saying I'm funny! Because I love writing, and while I love writing I mostly write about some really depressing stuff, and what I hate about that is people getting a funny taste in their mouths as they read what I just wrote, so I try to make it a little lighter with some humor every now and then. Don't get me wrong, I'm still writing about some depressing ass stuff and I'm not a stand-up comedian at all. I just like my depressing writing having some sort of flair that makes people not take it as super serious as it maybe should be taken. And over everything else, I love entertaining! Love it! So thank you for complimenting me and my wit! I highly appreciate it!   


About the rape fantasy. Sure. You're maybe just that sick. But don't take offence with me saying that you're "that sick," that's just the way I need to look at this to comprehend the thought of someone getting a hard-on thinking about all those years after such an event where you'd feel dirty and unclean, never being able to clean yourself of what happened. Feeling depressed, not getting understanding anywhere and eventually, probably, killing yourself.   


Or that's my estimate, the reality could be totally different! Sure! I'm just some nut job on Reddit thinking he can analyze some other nut job on Reddit without as much as knowing his real name! Don't take my two cents, if this is something you truly feel you want in your bones, as deep as every single bone in your body goes, then heck, go for it, my dude, arrange some group of women to abduct you or drug you and making all your dreams come true! Pay them even!   


But what you've talked about reminds me of someone I once saw in a movie and have heard jokes about ever since, me never realizing it was a real thing but eventually just google'ing it and even when I've been perverting around Fetlife.com seen some people who do this in real life...   


Have you seen Pulp Fiction? Remember the scene where Bruce Willis rescues the black guy from some sweet, sweet anal rape? In that scene is an individual who's generally known as a "Gimp". Which is basically just someone who sometimes gets paid money, sometimes pays money himself for that status, but in the end, is always just a toy to be kept around in a dungeon for whenever the "owners" have or find the time to use and abuse him for prolonged periods of time, sometimes the torture can range from hours to days, days to weeks, weeks to months at a time.   


Have you ever thought about becoming such an individual? You'd, of course, make your terms and deal with the owner of the dungeon, but in the end, you'd get what you've always wanted! Getting molested in every which way till next Sunday!   


And about this: " There‚Äôs a reason that there is plenty of porn out there where the woman is role-playing the rapist and the man is the unwilling sex slave. That‚Äôs because there are probably a lot of men that actually want to be forced to have sex with a woman."   


I'm somewhat known as a professional pervert myself, my latest fetish being young and petite Asian girls because their tits always just seem to look so absolutely delicious. I swear, in like 98 videos of a 100, the tits on those Asian gals are most often than not absolutely perfect and just the sight of those holy grails makes me cum buckets every single time! I'm a tit man if you hadn't noticed!   


But yeah, being a pervert and having jerked it over everything from young and petite Asian girls to Tranny porn where the chick is dominating the guy's asshole and mouth(I was once hardcore into that, don't feel it anymore though), I can probably with as much certainty as I possibly can say that I've never noticed this female dominating the man into unwanted relations, aside from some Mother-Son porn which is kinda my guilty pleasure and secret shame at the same time.   


I'm very curious as to what one would write into [Xvideos.com](https://Xvideos.com) to find such porn? Can you enlighten me? Maybe you're contagious with this style of porn that you're into and it's possible that I might get into that whole thing if I like what I see... Please do tell me how I find such porn and send me your favorite clips via private message if you'd like to get your perv on and share some of the stuff you love the most with an open-minded individual who has been able to jerk it to all sorts of porn aside from gay porn. I have tried but there's just something about a guy fucking another guy in the ass that repulses me in every way!   


I love you, man! Thanks for constantly replying to my replies and please do send me some perverted shit via DM! Please do! :D

44^Loud_aTt^black^Tryna grab some h in a popular dealing spot at a corner store, hollerd at a black brother and said I need some ‚Äúhard‚Äù He hops in my car, spits out 2 bags of crack cocaine on his palm, I was like naw bruh that heron and he was like ahhh I gotchu stay right here patna. Anxiety shooting thru the roof bc that was so awkward lmao, he never came back but my old plug drove past and I followed him bc I recognized his truck, ended up getting it. I did a couple lines of coke about an hour before I got it. right before I left to go up to the cities. All in all a good day and good memorie with my best friend.

45^Airziggy^opiates^ Yea looked it up online eventually foubd research that apparently abrupt stoppage of opiates can cause it temporarily or as bad as neeeding surgery (yikes!) I drive for work so huge issue for me right now. How long till yours was back to normal?

47^Dale-Peath^china^Id make sure it didn't come from China cuz there's a sneeze thing happening or something

47^Dale-Peath^dreams^I really hope so when I start because I can never dream unless I oversleep by a large margin then as I force myself to sleep even more that's when the dreams begin. Interesting stuff.

47^Dale-Peath^opiate^Opiate guyz think they're having fun in the physical realm but truth be told they hatin cuz the real fun is in the astral plane.

47^Dale-Peath^black^Of course, and this is very relatively universally beneficial for most people mind you. Turmeric has a very powerful anti inflammatory and brain protective nature equivalent to Advil, it works best and is absorbed through black pepper and fats like olive oil as a combo works even better as it becomes absorbed in an extreme fashion, pure CBD will work as the same and it extremely good at protecting cell damage and it also combats depression and anxiety. Both substances need some time to max out in effects so don't expect a night and day difference. You can find many third party lab tested supplements under sites like labdoor. 

I am currently using

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A39MPNI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_ORekEbDCCJR95

And Garden Of Life CBD 30MG CBD capsules, which also come in droppers and the droppers you can find at an even larger MG quantity. Droppers that you hold the oil under the tongue tend to work faster, capsules don't kick in as fast but they last longer.

I plan on experimenting with a different form of turmeric and black pepper combo. Both have helped level me out mentally and very effectively physically as I have two crippling autoimmune diseases. Hope this helps.

49^Johndough1066^opiates^Blame is pointless. Just give people who are kicking opiates methadone. Period. That should be standard treatment everywhere -- jail or the streets. It should be protocol in every jail and hospital and doctor's office. 

No one should have to suffer from withdrawal symptoms ever.

49^Johndough1066^opiate^>I think if you took bupe after oxy or something too soon you would still go into PWD Even if you weren't addicted previously.Im not sure but I'd bet on it.

You'd lose that bet.

Have you read the other replies? You should. 

How can you go into precipitated withdrawal if there is no way you can go into withdrawal? Do you understand? 

>I don't think it has anything to do with regular withdrawal 

Uh, it has everything to do with withdrawal. It precipitates the withdrawal. Do you know "precipitates" means?


>for the most part I think it makes you sick beacuse you are on opioids (currently) and the bupe interferes.

The bupe prevents the opiates from getting on your receptors. That doesn't matter if your Brain is producing normal amounts of dopamine, which it would be doing if you are not addicted. 

But if you are addicted, your brain is not producing dopamine. When the opiates can't get to your receptors, and there is no dopamine being produced, you go into withdrawal. 

>id go as far to say if you asked ANY sub doctor if an opiate nieve person took some oxy and a sub 3 hours later would they go into PWD? in a non biased way they would all say yes.

If a sub doctor told me that, and none ever has, I'd get a new doctor immediately. 

Why don't you actually ask some sub doctors and find out. Heck, a doctor gave one of the replies on my thread. He agrees with me.


>If you argue with them a little they might alter what they said beacuse it's not worth pressing the matt

Why would anyone do that?

Why do you believe things for which you have no evidence whatsoever?

49^Johndough1066^opiates^Not true at all. If you've never been physically dependent on opiates before, you can use for three days and you absolutely will not get a physical dependency. It can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start.

49^Johndough1066^opiates^Not true at all. If you've never been physically dependent on opiates before, you can use for three days and you absolutely will not get a physical dependency. It can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start.

Of course, the fentanyl can kill you, so why risk it?

49^Johndough1066^opiates^I never get high from methadone, either. But it's a great way to kick without acute withdrawal symptoms. Keep it around just in case you can't get your opiates.

You only need a few days worth of methadone to kick heroin or oxy with greatly reduced or no acute withdrawal symptoms.  You might need as little as 20 mgs a day for 3 to 5 days -- or more mgs (but not days) depending on your habit. You can't get addicted to methadone in such a short time. 

So hold onto it. Keep it around for emergencies.

49^Johndough1066^opiate^> I snort 8-10 of them for my first dose and then usually do the rest about 6-8 hours later. I am usually done ingesting them by midnight and pass out sometime after dawn. I will sleep until 1 or 2PM and then take my suboxone an hour or so after waking up. Is this something that would normally send people into precipitated wds? 

Absolutely not. You only get precipitated withdrawals if you are addicted to an opiate like heroin or oxy etc., and then you take suboxone. 

What you're doing doesn't cause pwd.

49^Johndough1066^opiates^Not true at all. If you've never been physically dependent on opiates before, you can use for a week and you will not get a physical dependency. It can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start.

49^Johndough1066^opiates^>Also, the kick on H is way shorter than percs. 

What? Not real percs it's not.  Kicking pills -- legitimate pharmaceuticals -- is much easier and shorter than kicking heroin. 

>Fent gets everyone, fuck China for ruining opiates.

Fuck China for so many things.

49^Johndough1066^opiate^They powers that be here in the US are definitely making it MUCH harder for anyone to be prescribed opiate pain medication, but it's not actually illegal. 

And that is a very important point. 

There are doctors who will lie and say it is illegal. These doctors are scared, but that doesn't excuse lying. 

What this poster was up to, I don't know.

50^diedro^opiates^Resist the urge to use. You're doing really good getting to 4 days. You will be able to sleep without opiates in time. Maybe you can get another sleeping aid like a benzo? The anxiety and cravings are normal. Try to distract yourself and keep busy. If you relapse now, you might still be using when your partner gets out and they might end up relapsing. Now you've both got a chance to get clean.

50^diedro^opiates^It is amazing being free of constipation. That was one of the worst side effects of opiates for me.

50^diedro^opiate^Congratulations on 4 weeks! I'm 1 day behind you. Came really close to relapsing 3 times due to stress but somehow managed to resist. For me the last symptom to go, which I still get sometimes, is sudden attacks of anxiety and sweats, especially in the night. I agree working out helps. Even just as a way to fill the time you'd normally spend in the opiate bubble.

50^diedro^opiates^I've found them helpful. I used them with opiates before I properly quit. In one trip I saw myself standing in an open grave, taking pills. After each trip I had a greater desire to stop using and it felt easier the next day. I have used them after stopping and found the experiences very cathartic and emotional. They have helped me feel compassion for myself. They help bring up and face the pain I was suppressing with opiates.

50^diedro^opiates^I've had it with opiates but not tried it yet when clean. I'm interested though, might give it a go.

/u/mrbrinks (not sure if that will link properly) has tried it.

50^diedro^opiates^Pregabalin & clonidine are really good for acute withdrawals. I switched to diazepam for a couple of days after that and found it very helpful. But only use for a couple of days medicinally for sleep/anxiety/pain, you don't want a habit for benzos as the WDs can be worse & more dangerous than opiates.

50^diedro^opiates^Congratulations on 5 days clean. It's nice knowing people can relate. The opiates won't fix these problems. It'd just be a fake relief. I think the only way is to just face it and do what we can.

50^diedro^opiates^Opiates can cause sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. This can result in elevated liver enzymes and there are cases of pancreatitis which have been attributed to opiates. Seems to be worse in people who have had their gallbladder removed.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5276812/

50^diedro^opiates^Nice work, you're doing really well. A bit of kratoms a lot better than h. I'm struggling with depression too but I was depressed during my use too. One thing I'm trying to do which might be helpful to think about, is be more accepting of feelings and try not to avoid them. That's what opiates were for me.

50^diedro^opiates^Had a few mild trips while on opiates, then stopped and had a 2 after the acute withdrawals, first was fairly strong

50^diedro^opiates^I've been drinking since quitting opiates. In the past there was a time when I slipped in to drinking a bit too much, but I've never had a problem or addiction to alcohol. Only opioids. I enjoy dinking socially sometimes. Biggest issue with alcohol for me is the toxic side effects/hangover is horrible, and has been an excuse to use opiates in the past. I also think it's a far inferior drug to opiates. I have known people who had stopped drinking, and then decided to have 'just 1' drink, and ended up wasted, on cocaine/pills, gambling, going strip clubs etc within hours and going on a bender. For some people alcohol really can lead them on a bad path fast. I think you have to decide for yourself.

50^diedro^opiate^You are right. Thanks for the advice. It's just so hard to resist sometimes when I'm stressed and start really considering the opiate escape. Hopefully I can overcome this.

50^diedro^opiate^It is normal to feel depressed when you stop. You are going through a big change. And you've been through a lot already. Let yourself acknowledge the sadness and feel it while it is here and have a little faith that time will help it to pass. Us opiate users spend so long numb to the world and our emotions that when we stop it overwhelms us. I'm at day 21 and still struggling with depression. Best of luck.

50^diedro^opiates^If you want to stop, I think you need to decide to get clean and commit to it. Plan ahead. Get the supplies you'll need (food, drinks, comfort meds) in advance. You could try a slow or fast taper. Accept that getting off the opiates will feel bad, and give up your resistance to feeling bad. You are not weak, opiates are strong. Best of luck to you. You can do it.

50^diedro^opioid^I have some naltrexone, I used it ULDN alongside dihydrocodeine for a couple of weeks before withdrawing last year. Really helped reduce the diarrhoea at least. I haven't tried it since stopping but I was thinking it might be a good idea. Supposed to upregulate opioid receptors.

50^diedro^opiates^Keep it up, power through. Distract yourself. Accept it and commit. You will feel better soon. You just have to give yourself the time to go through it, then you'll feel healthy without opiates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51^DopeGuy1234^opioid^For tooth pain is Ibuprofen infact way better than an opioid. Also IDK why you guys in the USA are acting like you need opioids for every small injurie, here in my country the docs dont prescribe opis that much at all, they first trie other pain pills and if they dont work they start giving you opioids and also they dont start with stronger ones like oxy, they first trie Tramadol and Tilidin, DHC and codeine, mostly Tilidin. And if they are also not working good enough then they start giving you oxy. But yeah you guys got so used to battling every pain with Oxy thats insane. And also if you get 4 wisdom teeth out here they give you Ibu 800mg and a script for 20x100-200mg Tramadol. Also they prescribe here much smaller packs. We got 3 script sizes. N1 is 2 blisters a 10 pills/blister, N2 are 5x10pills/blister and the biggest ones are N3 with 10x10pills/blister. If someone with cancer for example needs more pills cause he will die for sure then they start giving you more and stronger pills, I know a guy who got cancer and he will die in the next 1-2 years from it and then the docs will make it as comfortable as possible, he gets 2xN3 packs of 80mg ER Oxy and a N3 pack of 60mg IR Oxy for breakthrough pain and also he gets 6-8 x 100mcg/hour Fent patches. He is often very high cause he dont uses the fent patches as prescribed cause he dont like them that much, he just uses them if he really is in big pain. He then uses about 2-3 fent patches a month and is nodding the whole time. Also he probably needs to go to a hospize to die. He will go there for his last 3-6 month if he wont be able to die at home. But yeah I can understand you, you guys got Norcos, hydros, oxy etc way faster than ppl here in Europe and thats why you are so used to it.

51^DopeGuy1234^opioid^Yeah I remember when they took out my wisdom teeth, they took out first the right side and then 3-4 weeks later the left side cause my teets already broke theough and were way too big for my mouth. So mostly here in Germany you get Ibu or metamizol, Paracetamol for tooth pain, I got a pack of Ibu 800mg and a pack of Paracetamol 600mg. After the first night I had to go to a emergency dentist, cause it was Saturday and no dentist was open and because I bleed so much I had to puke a few Times in the night and that tore apart the strings of the wound, I was in extreme pain and the energency dentist gave me a script for Tilidin/Naloxon 200/16mg which is the most prescribed opioid in Germany, its a good opioid for pain and also if you take more of them you can get a nice buzz off of them. At first my mom didnt wanted to get me the Tilidin cause opioids are soo bad and she is in general against all medications, she wanted to give me Globuli and a few other shit of nature healing shit... thank god that my dad still lived back then and he got me the script from the pharmacy and after 7 days my face was still swollen and I took all the Tilidin, just a small pack he went to that emergency dentist again and got me a N2 pack, N2 means that its a pack of 5 blisters, in one blister are 10 pills, at first I had a N1 pack with 2 blisters, for the second wisdom surgery my dad drove me and he told the dentist to give me a script for Ibu, Paracetamol and Tilidin and that he should give me a N2 pack minimum, my dad could do such things very good he was polite but you knew that he wont leave untill he got what he asked for. He was an awesome person, miss you so much dad. I still know that he took me once to his pain doctor and he told the doc that the Tilidin and morphine isnt working anymore and that he wants to get Oxy ER 60mg cause he got that after a surgery for a few weeks and it helped very much, so he talked so long untill the doc gave him a script for Oxy ER 60mg and also the doc added a script for Oxy IR 40mg and also a script for 100mcg/hour fent patches. He got enough patches for a month if he uses two of them in a week but he just used one a week and sometimes none. So after he died he left a stash of: 400x200/16mg Tilidin/Naloxon, 200x60mg ER Oxy, 150x40mg IR Oxy, 60 100mcg/hour fent patches, 600x200mg Tramadol and 200x120mg DHC and about 50x10mg Diazepam and 80x2mg clonazepam. All the amounts are a round abound. If I write 400 pills it could have been 390 for example. I just remember them really good cause after my dad died we got alot of benzos, I especially became much more cause I found him dead and got PTSD from that also my doc already knew that I had Depression before my dad died, so I got a big script for Alprazolam 1mg, Lorazepam 2.5mg and diazepam 10mg. So I digged through the stash in about 6-8 month, also my brother took a few pills but only about max. 50x200/16mg Tilidin/Naloxon, I brought the whole stash in my room after about 2 month and told my family that I threw them away cause 1. I couldnt see them anymore and 2. my dad and I shared our cabinet in the mirror cabinet, I hope that makes sense. LOL. And my family believed me, when I just had about 100 pills left to stay well I started meeting ppl on the streets who used mdone and I got a 40mg blister (10 pills again) for 60‚Ç¨ I then used about 80-100mg mdone daily for a month, then my plug went MIA, then I tried Heroin cause I wanted to try it so badly and immediatly fell in love, that was about 8-10 month after my dad died. The next 2 years I used daily about 1g of H #3 and for the last 6-8 month of the 2 years I also used about 8-12mg clonazepam daily, in between I mixed in also meth, coke, crack, many different benzos and many different opioid pills. My favorite pill beside Oxy IR are Tapentadol currently, I really like them very much. I maintained myself with them for about 2 weeks and tapered down, at the end of the taper I had no wds which never worked with mdone or any other pill. If I could get a monthly script for enough of them then I could live a sober life for sure. LOL. Sorry for the wall of text but I am high as a kite üòéüòÇüòÇüòÇ

51^DopeGuy1234^opioid^Yes you can get high from bupe if you got no tolerance. I would start with a very low dose like 0.5-1mg cause bupe is very strong opioid. But yes if you got no tolerance like you have then you can use them recreational. Because of the dose you should maybe wait for someone who knows bupe better than me. I just know from this sub that you can use them to get high too. Many ppl snort them also to get high. IDK if the bioavailability is higher if you snort them. But yeah as said maybe wait for someone else to give you better direction of dose. I know that in my country theee are 0.2mg and 0.4mg for pain and many addicts use these pills to get high if they cant get dope. Also there are 2mg pills and 4mg and for maintenance there are 8/2mg Bupe/Naloxon like the subutex you got in the USA. All the other pills got no Naloxon in them so many ppl here shoot them also. Have fun dude and dont take too much.

51^DopeGuy1234^black^Yeah from the Pregabalin I also got bad visions. Its like if you use too many benzos and black out. At least for me it was like that everytime.

51^DopeGuy1234^black^Yeah I know, sorry but english isnt my first language, I meant by seeing a doctor that he should go to the ER and see a doctor there. That was what I wanted to say. But yeah I probably said it wrong. But yeah that shit looks disgusting anyways and I dont get it why OP didnt came to the solution on its own that it is necessary to go to the ER. If my arm would look like that I would be very concerned about it and would go to the ER immediatly. Fuck if OP waits much lobger he can lose his arm. That shit isnt fun. I know 2 people who lost an arm and a leg. The guys arm looked very similar to OPs one, he waited about 5 more days and kept injecting in that arm and missed a few more times and then boom, he lost consciousness and wakes up in the ambulance car while driving to the ER and they had to take the arm off because otherwise more limbs could've been getting infected. And the guy who lost his leg shot in the same spot for about 2 weeks straight untill he had a really big hole, it looked a bit like in requiem for a dream and the hole got bigger and more infectedso badly that he couldnt walk anymore and his whole leg turned blue and black and stank like a 4 week old dead pet and he kept shooting in that leg cause all his veins were already gone cause a month before they already had to cut out a ca. 15cm long and 3cm deep part of his leg cause of missed shots and abscesses. The guy who lost his arm killed himself 3 weeks after losing his arm. He hated life after losing his arm. He kept using while he was in hospital and his other arm had 3 abwcesses and the doctors told him to stop IVing in that arm cause otherwise they need to take the arm off too and after that message he went outside to smoke a cig and walked in the clinic forest and shot about 2g of dope at once with a extra large syringe he had stolen in the hospital and died there. They found him the next morning. The dude who lost his leg went to long time rehab for 6 month and was clean for 3 years and then relapsed, he is now in the mdone programm and uses dope from time to time but he is only smoking now and since we just have #3 here smoking is a good alternative to shooting dope. So OP please go to the ER immediatly. I wish you best of luck and that they can fix your arm fast.

51^DopeGuy1234^black^Yeah, I am not alone, I am living togetheelr with my older brother, he tqkes care of me. He also savved my life twicw qlready when I ODed. He is an awesome older brothee and I love him for that. He always takes care of me whether I black out or if I OD, he already aafed my kife once when I stopped breathing for 5 min and once when I lost conscious. I qlready told him often that he is the best big brother on this fuvking world. At leqst ai dont have the feeling anymore that I need to puke. But thanks to you also for caring about me. Its 3 30am here, I will eat now smth and then I will go and sleep a bit. LOL.

51^DopeGuy1234^opioid^You are welcome. I just also had to get that off my chest cause I think the amount and strength you guys got pain pills for injuries that could have easily been treated with half the strength and amount of pain pills. But I also understand you, if I would have been able to get pain pills in that strength for one of my many injuries like broken arm, leg etc. I would feel the same also because of that fact you guys are feeling pai. way different. I know that pain is subjective and if you had access to pain pills way easier for decades then the general subjective feeling of pain is way different than in other countries. So I really can understand you. Maybe you can call your doc again and tell him that you are in extreme pain and if he is able to give you a script for a weak opioid like Tramadol or norcos, hydros 5mg-10mg. Maybe that is working. And I also wouldnt ask directly for opioids, I would just tell him about your extreme pain, cause if you ask for opioids then the red flag pops up in the docs brain. Did you ask him directly after the surgery for pain pills or did you just waited untill he gave you a acript?

52^nto_the_sun^opiates^This is who people should be listening to and trusting - those specifically trained to manage pain and opiates. I don‚Äôt claim to know all the answers but I know that causing someone additional pain is not a successful outcome. Physicians can talk to each other. If a dentist doesn‚Äôt know how to manage a chronic pain patient, call the fucking treating physician who does! This is not new. This is not hard.

52^nto_the_sun^black^I don‚Äôt want to talk for others but I‚Äôm not sure that people ever really ‚Äúfeel depressed ‚Äú. Not how the commercials say we should at least. I‚Äôm not sad, but I‚Äôve also waited for my black screen. Andrew Solomon once said the opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. 

Maybe you can understand my bumbling too lol. I hope you figure your movie out

52^nto_the_sun^chocolate^Hi, thank you for the response and concern and advice. I really did not mean to make it sound so juvenile. I would never think of reddit advice as gospel and I wasn‚Äôt really looking for advice per se. I have my whole normal set up for the weekend - days off work/Kratom/clonidine/supplements/support/hydration/87 lbs. of dark chocolate, etc., etc. and I have options for after and still a ton of support. I‚Äôm not going in blind. 

I know many people here have kicked before and I really just wanted a conversation of opinions. I‚Äôve done it a handful of times and I have attempted the taper before, trying to be responsible-ish and prepare. And I have said forget it and did all the drugs and had all the fun until it was quit day. I think there are good and bad points to both - either way the withdraws still suck.

52^nto_the_sun^opiate^Idk about getting their licenses ripped away but there are so many regs now with prescription. I know it is hard but keep looking for a physician that will truly work with you. There are pain specific docs that can and will dose for opiate tolerant patients. You may try looking for someone in palliative care (it‚Äôs not just for the deathbed) or Physiatry. A lot of Ortho will get you nothing.

53^Jho_Ta^opium^BTH usually smells strongly of vinegar. Opium is supposed to have a more earthy or flowery smell.

53^Jho_Ta^opioid^That‚Äôs how many opioid addicts got started. In the beginning, it‚Äôs easy to not use everyday, only on weekends, etc. it makes you feel amazing and at that point there aren‚Äôt really any obvious negative effects, so the off days get fewer and fewer, and more and more excuses are made. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a hard day. Doing a line on my off day just this once  won‚Äôt hurt!‚Äù

Eventually, and sooner than you‚Äôll realize, you are using every day. Then, one day, you will be out of dope and you‚Äôll realize that you must have caught the flu because you feel TERRIBLE. Them you pick up (for the muscle pain!) and within ten minutes you feel fine. 

Congratulations. You are now an opioid addict. 
People always think that they are smarter and stronger than the opes. Very rarely are they correct. Be careful out there.

53^Jho_Ta^opioid^Thank you! I think that‚Äôs key to why some folks don‚Äôt really like benzos. The ‚Äúeuphoria‚Äù is atypical in that it‚Äôs not so much the presence of the drug, but the fast acting relief and removal of all your anxiety. 

Similarly, I‚Äôve anecdotally found that people not prone to opioid use/abuse find that they just get tired and maybe a little nauseous from oxycodone. However, those folks that develop problematic opioid usage patterns always say that oxy gives them energy and makes them productive. 

I suppose it comes down primarily to genetics in regards to how your body and nervous system react to opioids/benzos, existing issues such as pain, depression, and anxiety, and then also how predisposed to addiction a person is based on familial substance abuse history. (In my case, both mom and dad have a lot of family members that are addicts, so I guess that it should come as no surprise that I also developed substance abuse disorders.  )

Hope that makes sense. Wasn‚Äôt able to sleep much, so while my thoughts make sense to me, they may be gobbledygook t everyone else.

53^Jho_Ta^opioid^I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôd ever been to the practice. My best guess is that it was called in for someone with my first and last name and date of birth- I live in a medium sized city (pop 400,000) and have a rather common name. 

But yeah. In the end, I‚Äôll just chalk it up to JJ.

EDIT- while I don‚Äôt have much use for tramadol, my wife is opioid naive and has been having some pretty bad pain issues lately, so..... praise be to JJ!

53^Jho_Ta^black^This is a freestyle soda fountain. The little black dot above the screen is a camera. Why does a soda fountain machine need a camera?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54^anonymouslas^opiates^I appreciate your support and more so I am terribly sorry to hear about your dad. I can‚Äôt imagine how tough something like that would of been.

Thanks for your advice. I doubt I will ever try to use opiates as a self medicating tool and there won‚Äôt be any doctors in my area who think that‚Äôs a good idea (with good reason)

I think I‚Äôll stick to prescription ketamine and maybe try some shrooms üòÇ

54^anonymouslas^opioid^Yeah I completely understand. 
Which is why it can a bit frustrating with treatment resistant depression. 
It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs no cure or help for people like us unless we try something a bit outlandish and frowned upon. 

However, I also don‚Äôt want to develop a horrific opioid addiction because the way it makes me feel on it makes me feel like the person I always could have been and I know those signs lead to despair eventually when overused.

It‚Äôs just tough out there man, I just thought by 2020 we would be able to work out our chemistry :/ 

Thanks for your comment bud

56^totallynotmusk^china^A leaked voice message from a medical staffer claims that there is severe under reporting of spread of the novel Corona virus (N-CoV) . This comes after the death toll jumps to 106, with more than 4,000 cases confirmed in China.

57^216prophet^opiate^Tram is the most divisive opiate that exists. About half of the population is able to metabolize a good % of it into "desmethyltramadol", a good opiate, while others can't. So the ones who can (myself included) like it, those who don't, don't. I remember reading threads on Bluelight and Erowid, ppl would just rip anyone who liked tramadol as either being noobs or falling for placebo. So many flame wars over tramadol lol. Brought a bunch home from Mexico and my nephew who'd been snorting Opana LOVED em as well.

57^216prophet^black^The only thing I have to add, unfortunately, is..

- worse case scenario, all else fails.. If you come upon the 11th hour and still haven't found a new Dr - if she gets herself admitted to the hospital somehow BEFORE the scrip expires, the hospital will provide her meds 24/7 until she's discharged. I know that's pretty drastic and may only buy her a few days, but other than suggesting you/she source the black market it's all I got. Question - is she affluent? Could she come up with $1000 a month or more if it meant continuing to receive her meds?

Do they plan to taper her off COMPLETELY?? or lower her dose or switch to something else? 

Older woman, 30 years on meds, no history of abuse, about to lose it... Yea this worlds gone mad. Keep trying diff pain mgmt centers.. Daily.. And good luck.

57^216prophet^china^This dude is lying through his teeth. He didn't lay out his "best friend" with a single punch and put him to sleep for what, 7 straight hours? That just doesn't happen. If dude was out for more than a few moments that'd signify severe brain damage, potentially meaning the guys going to be dead or a vegetable for life. Y'all need to quit gobbling up the untested mystery chemicals from China its makin ya severely gullible lol. It's the interwebz, not just the only place dudes this badass exist, the only place they brag about their bad-ASSness.

57^216prophet^opioid^No it wasn't U4. Apparently it's an extremely clean, VERY potent and very euphoric /energetic synthetic opioid. After reading about it I REALLY want to try it. Apparently this guy was doing the equivalent of 500 bags of H worth! I can't even imagine what those withdrawals felt like.. Just yikes.

57^216prophet^opiate^I think the exact same thing every time I see the latest multi billion dollar settlement state X reaches with pharmaceutical company Y (not that I necessarily agree we need to be 'rehabilitated' or 'treated') : "why tf isn't this money funding new rehab clinics, why isn't it paying for someone's methadone or suboxone scrip?" rhetorical question of course.. Because they don't actually care about helping anyone. And the average citizen isn't going to demand safe, clean, potent pharmaceutical heroin bc opiates are bad, unlike the "good" drugs like weed, cigarettes and alcohol. We should be ashamed of ourselves for enjoying the euphoria a good opiate delivers.

57^216prophet^opiate^This thread is great. The post that comes to mind was, "my first time doing any opiate ever and its heroin", kid wondered why he was vomiting. Because you didn't do H, you did fent he was told. Begins arguing -

"no, I'm sure it wasn't fentanyl, if it was I'd be dead plus it didn't feel like fentanyl".

From the kid who'd never done an opiate before.

57^216prophet^opium^Yeah bruh this isn't cw, it's fetty. The days of scoring heroin so pharmacologically pure it's snow white are o-vah. Takes a REALLY good H chemist with REALLY good lab equipment /precursors, tons of opium gum, a sophisticated criminal supply chain to transport the final product, then you really gotta know people to get yer mitts on it before it gets stepped on by 150 different dirtbags. Meanwhile a gram of fent costs a few pennies to make in a Chinese lab, is 100x more potent than even the very best H, and can be bought direct by any 15 year old with internet access and a basic understanding of Bitcoin.

You've been snorting fent not H bruh.

57^216prophet^opiates^Yeah, benzos are already scheduled narcotics and they're starting to be treated the way opiates are despite being SUCH lifesavers for so many ppl. I have acquaintances who've been introverts their entire lives, had so much social anxiety they couldn't get a girlfriend or boyfriend then they got on klonipin and it literally changed their lives. I know there's a lot of people who love popping em like candy but me personally I never really got it, too many just make me feel sluggish. But more power to em. Xannies make my job dealing with customers way easier but I'm glad I weaned off. W/D is a bitch and one physical addiction is enough for me.

57^216prophet^opiate^Nah man it's still subjective based in the individual. I know that for a fact because not only did I get a fantastic high when I was opiate naive, it still made me very very happy when I had a heavy oxy habit. Codeine otoh, just yuck. Hated it and always have. It is a precursor for several kick ass opioids, tho.

I don't understand the pharmacology and don't claim to, but perhaps there's non-responders/responders/and *heavy* responders? All I know is it works for me and it's not placebo. I'd take it over hydrocodone which I think sucks ass any day, no question.

And the stuff I got from Mexico was just insane... Both my best friend and nephew who had an opana habit at the time got rocked off it.

57^216prophet^china^Wait, this stuff is schedule I bro. Is it legal in China as far as you know??

57^216prophet^opiate^Not a dumb question imho. From a lay perspective, if bth is just poorly processed H, perhaps further processing can be done? Obviously you can't go back to steps that were rushed/done improperly. But bth just seems so raw, I'd be surprised if the opiate alkaloids couldn't be further isolated and refined. Hopefully someone with chemistry knowledge will chime in.

57^216prophet^opiate^Another buperenorphine = precip wd misconception that even the most informed among us still have (myself included until recently) - bupe doesn't cause wd bc of its high binding affinity + reduced intrinsic activity. It causes it because it's a *competitive* agonist plus it's low intrinsic action at the receptor. 

If it was the binding affinity alone, all kinds of opiates including methadone would cause precipitated wd in anyone addicted to a more powerful opiate like H or Fent.

57^216prophet^opiate^Lol they could just as easily write a *lower* dose accidentally with that tactic. Congrats and all but I don't think I could distract my doc into writing oxycontin instead of ibuprofen üòâ.

I'm not gay but I'm really good at coming off gay.. Have a light lisp and can easily and convincingly seem 100% gay. And I'm reasonably good looking, was much better looking before I got into dope but I'm still a good looking cat who also looks much younger than my age. I'd be better off finding a gay doctor and just flat out trying to convince him to write what I want.. Pretty much any opiate but bupe or codeine.

58^thecelticpagan^dreams^Im a big psychedelic user also. Ive dropped acid and eaten mushrooms in dreams and have seemingly had full on trips. I wake up super fuzzy every time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59^clickclvck^dreams^So I have had a total of 3 lucid dreams but the first 2 only last about 10 to 30 seconds at most before I got too excited and woke up.

However, the 3rd one was last night and it was the first time I was able to stay lucid for an extended period of time. It felt like 20 minutes or so and I got to experience a wide range of activities before waking up. I had trouble with stabilizing as well but I did the trick where I rubbed my hands together and it helped but I still kept losing stability.

All in all, it was an amazing experience and it ended in sex (lol) but everytime I kept getting close to orgasm I would wake up but it was a false awakening and I kept doing a reality check and going lucid again to try to finish the job lol

59^clickclvck^opiates^Care to share any of this "heroin-trap" music of yours? I'm genuinely curious, I've always sought out music and songs that were specifically about heroin or opiates in general.

When you first mentioned "heroin-trap" I immediately thought of this dude that I've been listening to for a couple of years who I would describe as "heroin-trap-rap". His name is "Drippin So Pretty" and he has several songs about heroin addiction. Off the top of my head, there is "Last Shot (Heroin)" and "Dope Sick". There is a music video for Dope Sick and it shows his trying to hustle up some cash in the streets, I believe he ends up pawning a gold watch and meets his dude at the end lol

He is a legit heroin addict in real life or at least was at one point. He has started to amass a cult-like following and is really starting to blow up online, he's got like 50k followers on Instagram and hangs out and makes music with GothBoiClique (GBC) aka Lil Peep's crew.

Anyways, I'd love to take a listen if you wanna post up some links, or you can DM me them if you're not comfortable posting them publicly.

59^clickclvck^dreams^It's called sleep paralysis. It's a very phenomenon that happens to non-users as well. Your body basically paralyzes itself so that you don't act out your dreams in real life and hallucinations, hearing voices, feeling like someone is standing over you or something on top of you is choking you or holding you down are all very common side effects of it. This is actually where the "incubus/succubus" folk-lore came from.

59^clickclvck^dreams^I mean technically you are correct, I just feel it's not really a lucid dream unless you become aware and can manipulate the dream. 

What he is describing is more like a faux-lucid dream because in the dream, you know you're dreaming but your brain doesn't actually believe it so it's more of a story line to your dream than it is a reality if that makes sense. It's almost like a passing thought rather than, "oh shit, I'm dreaming!!" and you become self-aware within the dream.

In the couple of lucid dreams I've had, there was no doubt I was lucid dreaming, I woke up absolutely mind-blown and shook from the experience.

59^clickclvck^dreams^Not necessarily, it's possible to be aware you're dreaming without actually being lucid. It sounds like he wasn't in control of his dreams either since everything happened spontaneously.

59^clickclvck^opiates^Bruh, no offense but you have admitted you have never tried heroin or opiates before and you are trying to argue with a bunch of life-long heroin addicts who literally obsess about heroin all day, every day.

Pure heroin in the powder form (China white, ECP) is literally non-existent these days, it's ALL cut with some form of Fent including but not limited to several different types of Fentalogues who carry varying types of properties.

60^AquaNecromancer2^black^Holy shit you're so retarded I can't tell if this is a joke or not. The month exists because of fucking morons like you who decided without taking even a second to do any research that black people have no history. You're literally the reason why this month exists, you uneducated twat. God, I want to see you fucking people gassed.

60^AquaNecromancer2^black^Blackface is specifically made to mock black people and how they look. It isn't a white person trying to look black. It's a white person making a mockery of how black people look. The pure black face and massive bright red lips. White actors and musicians in the U.S. would put on black face and perform characters that existed to mock black people. They'd always be stupid, predatory, or wholly loving and subservient to the white characters. This lasted for centuries and there are famous early Hollywood films such as 'The Jazz Singer' which featured white actors in blackface because it was believed that black people couldn't act.

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiates^I understand your curiosity thats what i felt when i was just doing pills heroin is the big mystery that is intoxicating your gonna fall in love with this drug and destroy every relationship you ever had for "her" your curiosity right now can be life or death.  On the other hand i get it and your probally gonna be happy you did it at first because of how great the feeling is especially if you shoot up but its not gonna lead down a nice road i promise but once you taste opiates theres no going back its allways gonna be in the back of your head for life

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiates^Agreed it boggles my mind in some ways if it wasnt for heroin i probally would have offed myself in bad times it was the only thing that kept me "happy" until i could rebuild my life im now 2 years clean but opiates leave a taste that lasts forever your never able to forget that feeling and if things go bad in my life again i cant say for sure i wouldnt relapse thats the price we for dancing with the devil/angel.

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiate^Yeah those were precipitated withdrawals there like opiate withdrawals but x100 , especially since u been on fent for a whole year.

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiate^Sorry i highly disagree and u didnt provide as to who created this opiate epidemic 90% of heroin users started on prescription pills most of them prescribed! The evidence is overwhelming im one of those people. Not to mention the DEA completely now is taking the opiates away from legitimate pain patients

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiate^Its so unfortunate for people like you with legit pain the god dahm pharma conpanies and health clinics got everone hooked on oxy and opiates in early 2000s then decided oh shit we fucked up. When any person would realize that opiates arent easy to quit. So everybody switched to heroin now the DEA is basically forcing any legit pain patient to get screwed and forced to go to the street and get opiates or better yet heroin and then they O.D or get arrested therefore profiting the jail system and ruining the persons life and wondering how and why the opiate epidemic happened , its all a cycle that must have been planned

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiates^Lol dude u just brought back mad memories,  bavent played since like 07 but even not on opiates i was on that shit for hours it was the only game i actually enjoyed and i never play games. If opiates were introduced to me back then forget it i would have played for 12 hrs a day completely content what level are u?

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiate^Have u been doing so for years? Like only on weekends kind of thing and avoid withdrawal? Because i started the same way the addict brain allways rationalizes that somehow your different and ignore the impending doom that WILL happen with opiates could take 1 month or 1 year any opiate addiction ends in a train wreck , ive tried for years to get high successfully and only binge its just completely impossible i was wondering if there really is a "successful" addict out there that only does on weekends like a glass of wine on sunday dinners, heroin is just the perfect feeling thats why i think its impossible

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiates^I been clean for 2 years i was denying the fact that people can do opiates occasionally , reread my post its delusional to think heroin can be done occasionally thats what i said trust me ive had plenty of relapses that have proved to me i cannot do heroin recreationally

63^Responsible-Nothing^china^As ive said im sure your right im just giving my opinion on how it feels for me and others i know i dont know maybe its the dope ive got in my state thats different than yours, ive allways got euphoria from china idk what ur saying and also have gotten that itchy feeling off of it too the tar does have a slower come up i agree on that and im sure ur right also about the SEA heroin but guys on street today china white is fentanyl thats what they refer to, so please dont wanna debate no more

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiates^Whatever man seriously taking the post way to to serious drugs effect everybody different they do feel extremely similar , its opiates one is stronger witch is fentanyl, my buddies have said the same its heroin its a minute difference yes they feel different if u really take notice but to me its dope nothing different

63^Responsible-Nothing^china^Well dahm ok mr scientist isnt that what i said? Not saying ur wrong but china white is refered to dope worh fent , tar usally isnt cut with fent so its just heroin

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiate^Dude chill out ur having a problem about how heroin feels? Its an opiate ur complicating it way to much ive done both for over 15 years till i got clean the feeling is extremely similar just one if stronger , nobody knows about the white asian shit ur talking about on the street china is fentanyl

63^Responsible-Nothing^opiates^I agree bro kratom saved my life ! Dr.subs your iggnorant and stupid af!! Have fun with your sub withdrawals , kratom withdrawal isnt even close to how terrible subs are to get off of dr subs came at you like a complete prick hiding behind is computer screen probally an 80 pound toothless weirdo in real life so it boosts his ego , everybody has an opinion kratom is a life saving plant i got blown up in 2010 in kabul , Afghanistan and was addicted to opiates for 7 years! Till i found kratom

63^Responsible-Nothing^china^China is cut with fent , tar is pure heroin not cut with fent they both feel the same china is stronger though but more dangerous

64^BB19722^opioid^Hey again, mate. I wish I had answers for you, you know my situation- you're further down this path than I. I certainly hope it doesn't take 700+ days :D. Have you considered that maybe this is just a matter of adapting to life without the reward system of opioids? It's probably not something that will be changed by further "repair" of your opioid receptors. Keep at it friend.

64^BB19722^opioid^I've tried Kratom and it is quite useful, however it's illegal in my country (United Kingdom) and attempts to order it from abroad have been seized in the past. Either way they stimulate the opioid receptors, it's all about dosage. I've had worse withdrawals from a fairly big kratom habit (around 30g/day) than I have with therapeutic doses of Tramadol.

64^BB19722^opioid^Yeah, I dig, I do know the SSRI/SNRI effects, in fact that's part of the reason I've chosen it. Whilst the opioid dependency could build up again very fast, SSRI/SNRI dependency will take a long time to develop, I intend to taper, it seems I can maintain on 100mg/day, as a single XR dose, tbh that seems to me an ideal maintenance, far better idea than suboxone from my POV, esp given that subs make me feel like shit.

64^BB19722^opioid^I mean I'm afraid that Kratom is still an opioid, I've been on it and withdrawn, nothing compared to heroin but still. Unfortunately, I'm in the UK and it is illegal here. All RCs and herbal drugs are illegal here. The Psychoactive Substance Act 2017 basically changed the way the law worked, rather than having a list of prohibited substances, all psychoactive substances are illegal and it's the exceptions written into law, rather than the outlawed substances.

64^BB19722^opioid^I know you said not to talk you out of anything, and it seems your heart is stuck on "trying" it. Yet you're already in a position where you crave the opioid high to some extent and already have a taste for oxy. The heroin hole isn't something you make the decision one day to crawl down, you slowly shift until it's too late and you're stuck. I thought I was different and could try it just once... ok every month as a treat on payday, ok once a week can't be that bad? Well if I just keep it low dose it's no different to Tramadol or codeine. 

&#x200B;

That story is probably the same for all of us here. We're all the smart ones who will get away with the buzz without the fall, until we're not and you're just another junkie.

64^BB19722^opiates^Yeah, I'm torn myself. She's very straight edge- I don't fear her leaving me, I fear that I would expose so much broken trust that it would cause a rift that I can't really handle at the moment. Maybe once this is over and I can truly say I'm clean and back to my normal self, at least 70-80% I can say- but even then it exposes that I've been lying about why she's had to break her back nursing me. I think some things are best kept quiet if they have to. The situation where I see myself coming clean would be if I relapse and have to detox again- then I know the problem is worse than I thought and I really am a sick puppy and it's imperative for her to know. Until then I think I'd rather get away from this without the reputation of an ex junkie. I really don't think I'm likely to relapse, I have a rather stable life and stable relationships. I actually enjoy life, I got into this shit as a kid and I've changed a lot since and lost contact with the friends who I would take opiates with.

64^BB19722^opiates^I would advise setting yourself a hard limit of what you'd ever take in terms of opiates, nothing more than DHC/ Tramadol/ Vivo and stick to it and please do try to avoid a habit, captain obvious I know but I've just come off the most intense withdrawals ever and they are still present.

64^BB19722^opioid^It is an opioid, but yes it's very weak, relatively speaking. If you had a full blown habit it won't work- I tried to use the exact same pills to get me through my H detox, I would take 1000mg+ at a time (in XR form) out of desperation at some points and it did absolutely nothing. I started taking them to counteract PAWS around two weeks AFTER my detox so my tolerance is next to nothing. I needed a small amount of opioid to get maintain myself because life with paws is hell, especially when you need to interview, start a new job and generally bring your A game. Tramadol is an opioid agonist and an SSRI/SNRI, so it provides both anti-depressant and opioid effects. 

&#x200B;

You can get pretty high from Tramadol, even with a small/moderate habit, if the tablets are instant release, which is why I've deliberately put myself on extended release tablets for that I reason. They take around 2 hours to properly kick in, and I don't feel high, however my PAWS completely clears. I spent two weeks cold turkey first though so I think you need to do that before it's going to have any significant effect if you have a real habit, and yes that's a lot to go through : /

64^BB19722^opioid^Maybe replace the Zofran with a benzodiazepine if the doc would allow it, but as I said in another comment, some kind of opioid dependency maintenance might make sense here, at least temporary to go through a more protracted and tapered withdrawal which will be less likely to produce severe PAWS.

64^BB19722^opioid^Thanks friend, I've allowed bins to stack up in my house for two weeks now due to withdrawal, this morning I woke up after a decent sleep and just did it effortlessly (and I haven't redosed this morning). I will take just one tonight (100mg over 24 hrs) tonight and see how that makes me feel. Feels very strange being so satiated by such a relatively tiny opioid dose given only two weeks ago it took at least 0.7g of heroin just to keep me away from withdrawal.

64^BB19722^opiate^If she isn't able to handle a CT, she won't want to go through a narcan withdrawal, it's extremely dangerous outside of a controlled environment. I've accidentally put myself in precipitated withdrawals (the process you're referring to with narcan) with suboxone before and it lasted well over a day and the cognitive effects (the primary barrier to STAYING clean) were debilitating and I ended up taking a gram of heroin in an hour just to try to get something on my receptors that wasn't suboxone. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, we aren't talking one minute, we're talking hours with potential risk of seizure as far as I'm aware, the only time I've heard it being used as a method of withdrawal was in preliminary controlled trials for extreme cases of addiction in which the subjects were medically comatosed. Look, there's no easy way out of this, as I said, a taper using heroin is very unlikely to get you anywhere, your best options are to move her to a more appropriate maintenance substance or to pull the plug and CT it. 

For background, I'm currently at day 10 of a detox from an 8 year opiate habit, including years worth of heavy heroin use. It's been hard, real hard- but I'm here and I'm feeling better every day, it only takes 4-5 days to start feeling better and get the confidence that you can live without the junk, it's really something she ought to consider. What's a few days of suffering compared to the risks and downsides of using that shit?

64^BB19722^dreams^That was my experience with previous withdrawals from Tramdol, Kratom, codeine etc and shorter morphine binges. This is a multiple year long heroin habit though, it's a different kettle of fish. Only now am I starting to get relief from spasms, stutters, inability to talk etc. and even then my relief is only in the evening, I get a few hours of fever dreams and then wake up feeling like death again. 

&#x200B;

Of course, it's nothing compared to the hell of the first 3-4 days, that is truly brutal, probably the most painful thing I've experienced (CT as you probably guessed). But there's at least the saving grace on day 5 that you feel noteably less sick, then on day 6, and day 7.... Then day 8-9 hits and you can feel the rate of recovery slow and you start to feel pretty down, "How long am I going to feel like this?", it's not helped by knowing that this lasts for months for some- I'm hoping it's not much longer than two weeks and I'm doing all I can to improve recovery, but yeah there's more to this than the puking and shitting.

64^BB19722^opioid^Many opioid withdrawal symptoms last at least up to two weeks, I am on day 9 (nearly 10) of my heroin detox and I still feel like a bag of poo poo.

64^BB19722^opioid^Not to sound like some kind of AA puritan- it's great if you've managed to drop a serious habit for Kratom, but Kratom is ultimately still an opioid. Comparable to maintaining yourself on a 100-200mg/day Tramadol habit ime. Now, that's a hell of an accomplishment from when you were before, but you are still dependent. In my country (UK), Kratom got made illegal and nuked off the streets before you could say "But Mummy May that's how I get through work!", and I have read that legislators in various states are gunning for it, more evidence is coming out about it's opioid effects too and the US are even more puritanical about making sure all opioids remain prescription only. 

&#x200B;

I've come off Kratom before and it was basically fine, I'm currently day 9 from a heroin detox, and in comparison it was nothing, but it can still be a monkey on your back! Stay safe my friend! : )

How easy it is to take 9‚Äù on your back from a skilled top
How much I enjoyed it 
How easy it is to go bb when the top doesn't bother to as
How quick it was over. Out of the door in less than 15. How much I enjoyed being used like that

66^Opium_07^black^They feel threatened by young black folk making money, scared that some day they'll be powerful and wealthy enough to expose who them motherfuckers really are and how they've basically set up a country that encourages the institutional racism that put such a disproportionate amount of black folk in the prison system. That shit ain't justice man it's pure evil.

66^Opium_07^dreams^When I smoke for a long time then quit these things happen to me:

Insomnia, irritability, vivid dreams and markedly lowered appetite.

66^Opium_07^black^I remember in 2018 the pressed bars around here were fucking overdosed to hell and back. 1 of those fuckers would black you out. I miss that a lot I wonder what the hell happened.

66^Opium_07^opiates^You can try cimitidine.
It interferes with the metabolism of a lot of opiates not sure if hydro though.

Or you can try crushing it, mix with water in an oral syringe and put it in ze buttnhollen.

67^SensitiveMousse2^black^I‚Äôm slightly nearsighted do this could have just been all in my head. One night i woke up to pee and not to wake my roommate, I used the flashlight from my phone to go to the bathroom.

I turned on the lights and avoided the mirror for a while

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^The honeymoon phase is so fleeting, but it‚Äôs all I seem to want to remember. I have to remind myself how AWFUL they really are. It‚Äôs a conscious effort. Fuck opiates.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^I get scared, too, when I‚Äôve had a long run with opiates. I‚Äôve been caught in a binge then clean up pattern for awhile now, so it hasn‚Äôt happened lately, but I sure do remember. It‚Äôs like the fucking drug is whispering lies in your ear like some crazy possessive boyfriend or something. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never make it without me.‚Äù

Bullshit. You‚Äôve got this! Whatever your exit strategy is, you can do it. Four or five days is a huge accomplishment!

As for the anxiety and panic attacks, there maybe an underlying cause to them that hasn‚Äôt been addressed yet if you‚Äôve always had anxiety. I know for me there definitely was. For over a decade, I used to have panic attacks daily with or without opiates. It took finding a good functional medicine doctor to sort me out. Now, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a panic attack. I highly recommend finding a good functional medicine dr to rebuild you. Good health makes it harder to turn back. 

I could literally write a book on managing anxiety and I‚Äôm happy to share some tips with you. When you quit opiates, your adrenals go into overdrive, so it‚Äôs important to feed them. B vitamins and vitamin C are adrenal food. Adaptogenic herbs like ashwaghanda help regulate your stress response so you don‚Äôt launch into hyperdrive. Phosphatidylserine will also help calm things down. Maintaining electrolytes is important when under stress. This includes minerals. Most people are magnesium deficient, which causes INSANE anxiety. You can remedy this with a supplement or Epsom salt baths. Amino acid supplementation helps, too. It gives your body the building blocks for neurotransmitters. Try tyrosine, l-theanine, GABA, l-glutamine, inositol, taurine and 5-htp. I take a supplement called Neurolink that had all of those in them. Kava helps as well. 

Prescription drugs help, too. Of course, any benzo helps, but they‚Äôre a slippery slope. Clonidine for high blood pressure and muscle spasms. I used gabapentin when I kicked suboxone to help me sleep. 

Meditation, getting out in nature and being around animals help with anxiety, too. Even taking a walk around the block to get those natural endorphins going again helps. If you‚Äôre a meeting sort of person, absolutely go. 

I know there‚Äôs more I‚Äôm forgetting. Whatever your plan may be, whether medically assisted detox or alone, don‚Äôt let the pills lie to you. [This site](https://opiateaddictionsupport.com/how-to-taper-off-suboxone-what-is-the-best-way/)  helped me immensely when I quit suboxone and it‚Äôs tips are relevant with any opioid. Hope this helps. Wishing you the best of luck. You can do it! I say this coming from a fentanyl, oxycodone, Xanax and soma addiction, all of which were prescribed to me by a doctor. I still slip up, but I‚Äôm working on it and it‚Äôs absolutely nothing like it was before.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^It‚Äôs such a slippery slope. I was prescribed fentanyl patches and oxycodone for break through pain after a very serious car accident that damaged my cervical vertebrae. After learning to walk properly again, getting through all the different therapies I needed, I wanted off, so I told my pain management doctor. He put me on a REALLY high dosage of suboxone, but i didn‚Äôt respond well and was having migraines. When I told him this and asked for help, concerned that the suboxone wasn‚Äôt good for me, he kicked me out of his practice. I then had to get the suboxone from my psychiatrist. Lower dose and I responded well. 

That was 12 years ago. I‚Äôve had problems with opiates ever since due to some major undiagnosed health problems. These problems are now being addressed and I use way less than I ever have before. I have three days sober and I feel a lot better, but drs never called me an addict either....just in pain and physically dependent. I call bullshit. These drugs are in their very nature, addictive. Since becoming dependent while under the care of a dr, my relationship with this class of drugs has been changed. 

While I consider myself an addict with two rounds of suboxone therapy under my belt, I never fit in at NA or addiction counseling. Those methods of help were actually more detrimental for me. The label of addict is confusing for me, as I‚Äôm sure it is for you too. My best advice? Fuck labels. They don‚Äôt matter. Bottom line is that you want to get clean and need support whether you‚Äôre an addict or just ‚Äúphysically dependent .‚Äù They are just names for practically the same bag of misery. 

There‚Äôs something called SMART recovery that I‚Äôve been looking into. Maybe it could help you too? Feel free to HMU if you need to talk. Trust me, I get it. Whether your drug dealer is on the corner or office, the outcome of dependency is the same. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up. You have the desire to get well, which is the first step.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Thank you. I will happily take that advice. I‚Äôve been trying to be kinder to myself on this topic, but I‚Äôm still learning what that means exactly. I think that going through a suboxone treatment program in the past really messed my head up with this whole thing. They had such a cookie cutter program enforced with a lot of black and white thinking.....you‚Äôre either on or off opiates and there‚Äôs no in between. Or at least that‚Äôs the way it was for me when I went. 

There‚Äôs a whole other dynamic that comes into play when a couple is trying to clean up together. It‚Äôs hard. You play off one another, but it‚Äôs not a malicious thing, it‚Äôs just two addicts being addicts trying to clean up together. I can TOTALLY relate to your story. I hope you and yours are doing well in this journey. If you have any advice for me about how you guys are handling it, I‚Äôm all ears. Thank you for commenting. Super helpful.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiate^Yw and thank you for taking the time to read it. All my shit with PCS can also be INCREDIBLY painful and has its own symptoms that are similar to withdrawal. So, while my use this time around hasn‚Äôt been consistent enough for serious PAWS, I still have insomnia from my adrenal insufficiency. It‚Äôs tough to talk about because I feel misunderstood. I am on the TBI sub on here where I post about my treatments, but under a different username. Haven‚Äôt posted on there about opiate addiction, however I‚Äôm certainly not against doing so. I think I‚Äôll take your advice and post on here to see if anyone else has traumatic brain injury or something using the comment you just read. IDK. Trying to quit has been incredibly isolating for me, so I can‚Äôt tell you how much it means to me that you tried to understand me. I really need people to talk to. Thank you!

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^PCS is very complicated, but I‚Äôm happy to explain the basics of what‚Äôs up with me and how it happened. Traumatic brain injury is the cause of PCS. PCS is an umbrella term for a shitload of things. For me, that was organ malfunction and then failure, several severe hormonal imbalances, vestibular (balance, inner ear, body awareness) damage, cognitive issues that affect executive functioning, impulse control and the ability to pay attention (ADD), ocular damage (affects depth perception) and a shitload of PTSD. Basically, after my accident, I wasn‚Äôt the same person I was before impact and I was locked in fight or flight mode. Through the healing process, I‚Äôm slowly regaining my body and brain back. To get better, I had to go outside of conventional medicine.

Here‚Äôs how it happened: 14 years ago, I hydroplaned into a guardrail going 60 mph, spun across traffic where another car hit me. I then spun back into traffic and stopped in the middle lane with the drivers side facing oncoming traffic. When I was taken to the hospital, I had a ton of cervical damage and they told me I had two concussions, but never said anything further on it. I didn‚Äôt know what that was going to mean for my life moving forward. I had to learn to walk properly again, entered pain management, psychiatric care for trauma and had to go through a shit load of different therapies to rebuild myself. The concussions were never mentioned again and the psych misdiagnosed me with a ton of mental illnesses that I didn‚Äôt have before the accident. I was put on a lot of different psych meds. None of which helped me and all of them gave me extremely negative side effects. They were constantly switching up my meds. It was awful.

Fast forward to 2016/2017 and I‚Äôm dying. You couldn‚Äôt get me out of the ER and doctors were clueless as to what was wrong with me. In the summer of 2017, I died in my living room. I took a sip from my cup of water, choked, immediately stopped breathing and turned blue. This used to happen a lot before treatment...I‚Äôd choke on stuff and just stop breathing. I had no control over it and it was really scary. It was about this time that my organs (chiefly adrenals and pancreas) started shutting down. They had been malfunctioning for years , but I didn‚Äôt know it.  I was having constant panic attacks and severe GI issues. My body was shutting down and no one could figure out why. Then I heard a podcast about traumatic brain injury and a light bulb went off. Eventually, I found help and started the healing process through functional medicine. Im in hormone replacement therapy and we are rebuilding my body by giving my it what it needs to heal and replacing what‚Äôs missing (pancreatic enzymes and cortisol to name a couple) so that my body could function again. I still have a lot of work ahead of me before I‚Äôm back to 100%, but I‚Äôm well on my way.

What all this means is that normal day to day shit is difficult or near impossible to do. My brain is healing and rewiring, so I get over stimulated really easily. Shit like grocery stores, night clubs or big social gatherings are really tough. I‚Äôve had EXTREME panic attacks from this and it‚Äôs not a choice. My brain simply can‚Äôt process all the information properly yet. Driving long distances (over 30 min) is impossible for me right now. I actually just started being able to drive again without panicking. As I heal, things need to be familiar and have as little stress as possible or my adrenals will fail on me again. My adrenals are about 60% healed at this point. There‚Äôs a lot more to it, but that‚Äôs a quick overview.

I would say a huge part of my recovery is getting my brain back 100%. This includes impulse control which is a huge problem with TBI survivors. New research has shown that TBI survivors are extremely vulnerable to opioid use disorder (OUD) and I think I‚Äôm certainly one of those people. I think that‚Äôs why I never fit in at NA, but opiates are addictive no matter what brain you have. The person I was before I hit my head was cool with drugs, but did not have an addictive personality. Honestly, i feel it‚Äôs been a blessing to be able to see shit from this perspective and then heal enough to talk about it. Not much is known about TBI or PCS because the medical care is still evolving.

Shit this is long. I‚Äôm sorry.

I really like your take on recovery. You sound very accepting and nonjudgmental, which is great. Being too hard on yourself literally helps no one. I don‚Äôt think there is a perfect way to recover because everyone is unique. Sounds like you‚Äôre doing a kick ass job, though. I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more about staying positive and grateful. Our perspective is everything in life and we‚Äôre in control of what that may entail.

Thank you for asking me that and trying to understand me. It‚Äôs been tough to connect with others because my situation is, um, unique.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiate^Sure. Let me explain. So, after my accident 14 years ago, I was at my worst. I was in pain management and legally was prescribed fentanyl 75 mcg patches, 90 mg of oxycodone, 8 mg of Xanax and around 1,400 mg of soma per day. That was just what I was prescribed and would buy additional 30s, 80s or h if needed. The patches were eventually eaten or chewed on instead of placed on my arm. I‚Äôd run out of meds and would have to cop methadone. Towards the end of the month before my drs appointment, I was usually in withdrawal. This went on for years and to be honest, I can‚Äôt even remember how long exactly. This is when I got into my first round of suboxone therapy. 

I stayed clean from opiates for awhile until my divorce. I then picked back up when I could find it. I usually stuck with prescription pills because they were predictable and I could trust the quality. 30s being my favorite since they started putting that fucking time release in the OxyContin that would gel your nose up. My use wasn‚Äôt real consistent until I moved where I am now and found a few solid plugs.

2016 I was back on 30s again. It was pretty consistent because I used with a coworker who became a friend. At that time, my use was about 3-4 30s a day, but if I could find more, I absolutely did them. This is when I entered my second round of suboxone therapy because I knew EXACTLY where I was headed. Right around this time, my health started failing and I was in and out of the ER constantly. I tapered off the subs bc I felt they were making me sick. I didn‚Äôt know I had PCS at the time, but my intuition was right, because sure as shit, opiates are not good for PCS/traumatic brain injury survivors and exacerbate symptoms. For some reason, the suboxone was particularly bad about this for me.

After tapering off the subs and entering hormone replacement therapy, I started picking back up again due to pain. Same shit with the 30s and prescription pills, but more intensely because I was binging and then taking a few days to clean up. I‚Äôve been stuck in that pattern for awhile now and it was starting to get out of hand. 4-5 30s a day was certainly doable, but as I got healthier I could use less and be happy. Less being 1-3 a day, but occasionally more.

Quitting this time has been the easiest yet and I‚Äôll explain why. I‚Äôve been rebuilding my body for over two years. You would not believe the amount of fucking bloodwork, medical care and therapy. Nutritional deficiencies were corrected with IV therapy, injections, diet, supplementation and a lot of self care. Hormone replacement therapy also makes this LIGHT YEARS easier. A lot of the detox symptoms that people experience are mild for me because of this care and taking breaks between binges. I also have 24/7 access to my dr to help. My supplement regimen would make your head spin. I live by a series of never ending alarms on my phone to keep me on track with it. In addition, I can‚Äôt work, so I just sit around all day. I don‚Äôt feel great, but I‚Äôm used to being sick, so I don‚Äôt complain. I‚Äôm just glad to be alive. Facing my own mortality gave me a different perspective on shit.

Functional medicine is where it‚Äôs at. We‚Äôve completely rebuilt my gut biome and I supplement with the parts of my GI tract that are fucked up until it heals. (My pancreas was one of my organs to shut down) I‚Äôve basically been completely rebuilt from the ground up and I‚Äôm 37 years old.

That being said, if I can help you with supplement and nutrition info to help you feel better, please let me know. [This site](https://opiateaddictionsupport.com/how-to-taper-off-suboxone-what-is-the-best-way/) helped me tremendously when I quit suboxone, but it‚Äôs applicable for any opiate.

Sorry so long. I hope I answered your question. :) And thank you for your condolences about my father. I appreciate that.

EDIT: edited a lot because I forget shit ;)

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Totally understand. Yes, you can start before you stop. This is incredibly useful with magnesium, minerals and b vitamins, which your body keeps a reserve of. Your body doesn‚Äôt store vitamin C, but you can take some if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôd wait to start any adaptogenic herbs like ashwaghanda, Phosphatidylserine and kava until you need them. Your HPA axis isn‚Äôt freaking out yet. That‚Äôll happen once the opiates start leaving your system and you start withdrawing. Think of it like this: opiates are a downer, which keeps you sedated. Over time, your body acclimates to being sedated, so when you stop the drugs, you go into overdrive. That‚Äôs when the adrenal stuff becomes handy. :) That link I posted for suboxone tapering has a section that talks about supplements that helped me. It lists some different stuff than I did, but it also talks about dosing vitamin C and DLPA (another amino acid called Phenylalanine, which is a precursor to tyrosine). This is just me, but I‚Äôd also try to get some benzodiazepines and use sparingly for emergencies, unless you‚Äôve got an issue with those, too. Lord knows I used to. CBD can be helpful as well.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^In swoops politics to screw everything up. Why am I not surprised? Legalization is a step in the right direction, at least. The laws can always be reformed, however who the hell knows when and if that‚Äôll ever happen. 

I like that drs can use it instead of opiates, though and I wish it were an option when I was in pain management years ago. It‚Äôs much less destructive and has helped me through some truly painful times in my life. 

The way you‚Äôre describing it sounds wonderful. I‚Äôve been hesitant in the past because I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs WAY stronger and has more hallucinogenic properties. I‚Äôm healing from two traumatic brain injuries and have done enough hallucinating all on my own, which scared the FUCK out of me. Not down for hallucinating again any time soon. I‚Äôll see if my guy gets tinctures. Thank you!

69^ArtBeMaken^opiate^Brilliant outlook. You‚Äôre right. Thank you. I try to stay positive, but it can be tough with so much negative going on outside the opiate use. Sometimes I get lost in it and need to be checked. Thank you for reminding me of that.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Opiates are really good at making you feel wimpy, for sure. Please know that you‚Äôre strong. It‚Äôs a lot of hard work to be an addict, period. And you‚Äôre right: high price, high reward.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^There ya go! :) Opiates are really good at making you feel helpless when you‚Äôre not. Know that you have options on how you want to tackle this. All people who have become addicted to anything are strong by nature, you included. Just think of the energy expended on getting a daily fix. Congratulations on the new gig, btw!

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Quitting is a total mind fuck for me more than anything else at the moment. I‚Äôm not unscathed, for sure. I know there‚Äôs endorphin and other neurotransmitter problems from them. I know the emotional component is being lumped in with the grieving process about my father. I think what I meant when I said PAWS was the standard flu like symptoms. I‚Äôm sorry if my post came out like I‚Äôm in denial, I don‚Äôt under estimate the drug or what it has done to me, nor anyone else for that matter. I‚Äôm overwhelmed lately and I guess I needed a place to vent. 

I know I can stop, though. Within those 14 years, I have years of clean time, too. Right now is just really hard. Once I‚Äôm strong enough, cognitive behavioral therapy is on my treatment plan. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll help and I can‚Äôt wait to go.

Thank you and you‚Äôre right, it is slow, but I‚Äôm really lucky. My traumatic brain injuries (TBI) went completely undiagnosed until about two years ago when my organs just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. It took me hearing a podcast on TBI to figure out why. I live in a large city in the US and have the best drs, but no insurance, so you can imagine why it‚Äôs taking so long: $$$. And as I‚Äôm sure you know, opiates ain‚Äôt cheap, so there‚Äôs conflict. Plus, everything got derailed with dad. My TBI recovery is a story all by itself, which is why I‚Äôm debating a blog. I eventually want to write a book. 

Congratulations to your friend! Stories like that give me hope. Jesus....shot in the head. I can‚Äôt imagine. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs ok.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiate^Hi. When I was tapering and quitting suboxone, [this site](https://opiateaddictionsupport.com/how-to-taper-off-suboxone-what-is-the-best-way/) helped me a lot. It‚Äôs applicable for any opiate, really. There‚Äôs a section that goes over supplements that‚Äôs pretty good. I‚Äôve tried them personally and they saved me a lot of misery. Don‚Äôt forget to have some Imodium ad on hand to help with the stomach stuff.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Oh, I totally agree. Sub detox is waaaayyy worse. I had a dr who was a recovered addict and he explained why suboxone wd is worse than regular opiates. He told me that suboxone hits all the opioid brain receptors, instead of just some with regular opiates. So, the detox is more intense. Makes sense. It‚Äôs a wicked thing. 

You doing Imodium for stomach upset? I‚Äôve read about people taking probiotics during wd, but I haven‚Äôt personally, so I can‚Äôt speak to it. Part of feeling so awful is your GI tract being jacked up. I think something like 90% of your serotonin is made there. 

You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre making great progress. You got this. Your positive attitude is awesome and will help get you through this.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Yw :) Happy to help. Take your time with your taper if you can. It takes time for the body to adjust every time you lower your dose. If you go too fast, it‚Äôs essentially the same deal as going cold turkey, but drawn out. In a perfect world, every time you step your dose down, you‚Äôd want to stay there until you felt comfortable at it. For me, this was always INCREDIBLY difficult/impossible with my drug of choice. 

I do have tips for getting on subs. :) I went on them after my fentanyl and oxy habit. Don‚Äôt take any until you are in full withdrawal and absolutely can‚Äôt take it anymore. If you take suboxone too early, it will cause extremely wicked withdrawals. When I transitioned to subs, I didn‚Äôt wait long enough and I got sick af and you‚Äôve just got to wait that shit out. I think I was sick for about a day. The naloxone (same thing as Narcan) in subs knocks any opiates you have in your system off of the receptors and then blocks those receptors. This is why opiates have little to no effect on people who are on suboxone, which helps prevent relapse. You typically dose suboxone every 24 hours, or at least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done it. Suboxone has a really long half life, too, so once you‚Äôve taken some, you should be good for awhile. With the small amount you have, you‚Äôre still not going to feel great, but hell, it‚Äôs something that will take the edge off. I hesitate to tell you what mg to use. I‚Äôm certainly not a dr.

I understand your desire to dig yourself out of your own hole, but know that if it gets to be too much, you have options. Not having insurance doesn‚Äôt have to stop you from getting help if you need it. A lot of clinics have assistance programs and think of the extra money you‚Äôll have when you stop using. The manufacturers of suboxone also used to provide medication assistance, which made them super affordable. I think they‚Äôve even started doing online Suboxone therapy. If you Google ‚Äúonline doctors for suboxone treatment‚Äù you‚Äôll see some info. 

Make sure your kratom is from a reputable source where it‚Äôs tested for heavy metals and shit like salmonella. Some of the untested stuff they sell in gas stations has tested positive for stuff like that. I‚Äôd go with a red vein variety for detox. 

I‚Äôll check my messages later today. Not loving life this morning, but thought I‚Äôd respond here at least. I hope this was helpful and I‚Äôll talk to you soon.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Great topic! I‚Äôm a woman who has been in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy for over two years. I get testosterone and estrogen pellets and take progesterone orally. Hormones are vitally important to your quality of life. My HRT is done through a functional medicine doctor who specializes in balancing hormones. I‚Äôm not in HRT because of opiates though, but from post concussion syndrome. I love HRT! It absolutely helped saved my life. Conventional medicine is just now really starting to understand their importance. I had a lot of bad experiences with conventional endocrinologists, so I went the functional medicine route. Best decision ever!

69^ArtBeMaken^opiate^Talking on here has helped and I have my sister who is 20 years sober to lean on. Opiates are a small part of a bigger issue for me. Now, I‚Äôm not saying that opiates are by any means small, they are a HUGE deal....I‚Äôm healing from post concussion syndrome (PCS) and organ failure. This condition has already taken my life once back in 2017. Right now, my focus is on becoming healthy enough to actually live a normal life again. Part of this includes stopping opiates, but I‚Äôm not well enough to attend meetings or therapy yet. Part of healing from a concussion is attending cognitive behavioral therapy, which I‚Äôm really looking forward to doing once I‚Äôm strong enough. My opiate use will absolutely be a part of that. I‚Äôve tried NA and even AA, but they were more detrimental than helpful and I tried several different groups in different cities. This I did before the organ failure when I was more mobile. I‚Äôve had PCS for 14 years, but was untreated and misdiagnosed for 12 years until my body simply couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.

How about you? What has your recovery looked like?

By the way, just ate lunch and feel a lot better. :D

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Thank you! Yeah, fentanyl is scary as fuck. Especially the stuff you find on the streets that‚Äôs coming out of China completely unregulated. I used to be prescribed the 75 mcg patches and that shit is no joke. Glad you made it out. Congratulations on so much clean time! I really admire you for it.

You‚Äôre right, it is shitty that he did that, but he‚Äôs also cleaning up. When we were using, we‚Äôd say that to each other a lot, ‚Äúhey, wanna get some pills?‚Äù So, it‚Äôs not really an unexpected behavior. I did get pretty upset about it, though, which made him immediately drop the subject. He is a good man and has supported me through my healing process. My medical bills are insanely expensive and he works two jobs to pay them. When I died in 2017, he was the one who resuscitated me. I can‚Äôt be too upset with him about it. Opiates are one hell of a thing to kick, as you know. 

Thanks for saying that about being able to refuse drugs. I needed to hear that this morning. I got maybe 3 hours sleep last night and everything aches. I know today is going to test me physically and especially mentally with the lack of sleep.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Congratulations on 10 months! Damn. Super similar story. For us to both quit, have gotten this far, by choice, and with money in the bank is fucking amazing. It‚Äôs like the planets have aligned or something. I‚Äôm sure you know how it goes in a couple dynamic. You play off of each other. It‚Äôs a fucked up and really frustrating. I wanted to stop, he didn‚Äôt. Then he‚Äôd want to stop, but I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just glad we came together and are making it happen. Feels good.

I‚Äôm gonna be totally honest with you....if the opiates actually helped my current situation, I‚Äôd absolutely still be using. But they don‚Äôt. They just make everything way worse. I‚Äôm tired of stacking misery on top of misery and then getting upset that my life isn‚Äôt what I think it should be. Agreed. This sub is amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words. I really appreciate it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Yw! No problem. :) You nailed it! Addiction absolutely doesn‚Äôt discriminate and in my experience, opiates are the worst. I socially used drugs in my 20s, but nothing got ahold of me like opiates did. I mean, I was getting them from a doctor....someone who by definition is supposed to help me become healthy. Even went to school, got a doctorate, held a residency and basically worked their ass off to do so. 

This speaks volumes about the medical field in general. Instead of finding the root cause of your pain, they throw meds at you. I had to leave conventional medicine altogether to end my suffering and find a good functional medicine doctor. She dug in and found the root cause and we‚Äôve been working to correct it. I feel light years better and am on my way to being 100% pain free. 

But the mental part still lingers.

So, imagine if your dr DID listen to your claims of being addicted. That would mean they would share responsibility in that. It doesn‚Äôt look good for them to have to refer patients to a detox program. However, this doesn‚Äôt make it right. If you think it‚Äôs a problem, it‚Äôs a problem. You know you.

It sounds like you‚Äôve got a lot of wonderful stuff going on in your life. Getting through shit like this is about remembering that. Perspective is everything. And I COMPLETELY understand the urgency to get off, but you‚Äôre in a pretty cool position where you have support, you can take your time AND you have a child on the way who will benefit from that support. That‚Äôs completely awesome! Breathe and know it‚Äôs a temporary means to an end. You‚Äôll get there. I have faith in you.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^I completely understand. It‚Äôs the stigma that surrounds the word addict that can be difficult to accept. Everything from Just Say No in the school systems to the way the media depicts addicts has incorrectly reinforced a negative stereotype. A lot of people still believe that it‚Äôs a choice or a flaw in your character that makes you ‚Äúless than.‚Äù No one wants to be judged that way or treated differently. We‚Äôre all just trying to get through life in the best way we can. I‚Äôve found this particularly difficult when you have underlying health issues, which we both seem to have. Most medical professionals don‚Äôt fully understand addiction and I‚Äôve found a lot of doctors are fearful of even getting involved unless they‚Äôre experienced in drug counseling. Then there‚Äôs the issue of being pigeonholed into a one size fits all recovery program that COMPLETELY disregards your medical issues. The way this country handles addiction is 100% wrong. We‚Äôre not criminals. 

I understand the control thing, too. Please know that it‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs the nature of the drug. It‚Äôs tough, but it‚Äôs not a definition of who we are as people. 

I guess I‚Äôve had more time to process all this. I‚Äôve been where you‚Äôre at and had to get meds from friends and later drug dealers. Then, it crossed over to leaving drs out completely and using only when in extreme pain. I didn‚Äôt want the commitment of a pain clinic....they literally own you while you‚Äôre a patient there. It all just felt so dehumanizing to be a number in a system designed to get me ‚Äúdependent‚Äù and then shame me when I needed help quitting. Funny how you suddenly become an addict when you don‚Äôt follow the rules or want out. And I never went off the rails pawning or stealing stuff, never dr shopped or tried screwing the system. I‚Äôve always had a home and people around me to love and care for, pets, a career and other responsibilities. No criminal record either.

Forgive me, I should‚Äôve led with this: congratulations on your pregnancy! I can‚Äôt speak to that experience personally, but I can tell you that I have a neighbor with three healthy children who was addicted to opiates during her first pregnancy. Her story is similar to yours. Drs had her stay on the opiates until she gave birth. During the time she was pregnant, she slowly tapered down as much as she could comfortably. Afterwards, they switched her to methadone and she was able to leave opiates behind. Her eldest child is now 4. I see them frequently playing in the neighborhood as a family.

Sorry so long.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^I hear ya. Opiates dont give you room to cope or allow you to emotionally mature. Then something serious happens and it‚Äôs harder to deal. 

I‚Äôm sure you have a dr guiding you through your sub detox. Slow and steady always worked best for me. I‚Äôve tapered off subs twice and second time I did it too fast because I needed off ASAP. They screw with my balance and give me the spins due to an underlying health issue. I wish subs were an option for me.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^Totally weird. I think when you first start them they help, but then the honeymoon phase ends rather quickly and your left chasing the dragon. Now opiates give me crazy anxiety and just feel awful, but I kept taking them. And the bullshit that would run through my head when I was high was ridiculous....‚Äùfuck my fianc√© I‚Äôm leaving him. He‚Äôs such an asshole.‚Äù When in reality, that man has sacrificed EVERYTHING for me and is my best friend. So stupid.

69^ArtBeMaken^opiates^I feel you. Im recovering from cervical injuries and chronic illness. You have options when it comes to pain management. CBD and medical marijuana help me out quite a bit. I also did myokinesthetic therapy, which helped immensely. To find other options, I had to step out of conventional medicine, though.

Your body makes its own painkillers called endorphins. When you take opiates, your body stops producing them. It takes some time after you quit for your body to turn back on and start producing its own endorphins again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70^depress10n^opiates^Do you really need to try perc 30s? is it worth the risks? hate to be that guy, but opiates are no tip toe.

anyway, insufflation will always hit better than oral administration because the nasal membrane is very porous and thus allows drugs to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream, whereas you generally have to digest something orally administered which usually lessens the effects and increases the onset of action. Plus, you end up swallowing some of the drug that you snort anyway.

edit: i assume by perc 30s you mean 30 mg oxys. Percs only go up to 10mg oxy hcl+325mg acetaminophen (equivalent to 9mg oxy)

70^depress10n^auntie^25mg for human is a lot if you've never ingested marijuana, and nobody describes cannabutter by the weight of the butter. My brother has never taken as much as a perscription drug, he took 5mg and didn't feel anything (5'8, 110lbs). I started on edibles after quitting for 3 months, took 50 mg and felt a moderate high. I've accidentally dosed my auntie with 30mg (never done drugs) and it was hard to tell if she was high.

Furthermore, the whole poisoning thing for animals is still unconfirmed. Actually, as recently as 2016 there were tests for dog thc treatments for anxiety disorders and seizures. All of the "symptoms" of the "poisoning" are effects humans get when ingesting weed. The issue is that they don't know they are ingesting a psychoactive chemical, which is the risk you take with any drug you give a dog. 

THC would be no more dangerous (and probably less) than whatever opiates/benzo they'll give the dog at the vet. There are eayy more confirmed deaths from adverse anesthesia/dog perscription. There was one case that reported 2 dogs died after eating thc, but it has no sources, and doesn't say they died from the THC. There are countless videos on youtube showing the effect of a dog ingesting thc.

71^ozpoppies^opioid^Nah man that normalizes the fuckin market. Boycott this shit man. Need an opioid? Methadone, bupe, heroin. If it‚Äôs fent fuck that. Otherwise they‚Äôll stay successful and won‚Äôt have motivation to stop

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72^Treemeister1233^opiates^It's interesting if you think about it. The higher up the chain of opiates you go (or should I say down), the higher the reward. But of course also higher consequences. I'd almost want to say you would be better off with straight fent considering you don't know what else was pressed into that pill besides the .05% of fent (not accurate whatsoever lol).

And then there is the risk of hotspots. We can all hope our pills are pressed by chemist's but let's be real.

73^Trashrecluseuser^black^What are the odds of this guy being one of a handful of witnesses? Jesus Christ. That‚Äôs insane to me. What makes it so insane is the black boxes weren‚Äôt in the aircraft. It makes him probably the most important individual related to the entire investigation

74^dches1991^opioid^Methadone and Dogs by Pink Floyd.

My addiction was so ass backwards. I started with methadone. My ex's ma had an rx for norco 10s, methadone 10s, xanax 1mg twice a day, and a shitnload of gabapentin. She was in a bad car wreck like 12 years prior to meeting her. This was back in like 2007 when doctors would actually give you pain meds when you were in pain. She was on those SAME meds well over 11 years and never had abused them. My ex and i however, we did. Looking back im really disgusted that we did that to her. 

Ironically in 2016 a kid texting and driving hit me head on going 65mph. The front end of my grandam came down on my legs as i was standing in the brakes. (I didn't want to swerve into giant ditch on the right and there were other cars incoming to my left.) Figured dude would see me and get back into his lane. He did not. So long story short it took me 2 years to learn how to walk again. I have a permanent limp, lopsided legs, and I'm basically all titanium from my pelvis down. Femurs, tibia/fibula, knees, right ankle and foot. Now with the opioid crisis i can't get more than a few norco each month for my pain, and it doesnt even touch it.

74^dches1991^opioid^Depends on location i think. 7.5s are around $6-$7 and 10s are $7-$8 where I'm from. Ive seen 10s go for as much as $10 a pop lately tho with the "opioid crisis" in full swing. I remember the good ole days when 7.5s were $3 and 10s were $4 all day üò≠

74^dches1991^opiates^Im in a pickle similar to this but im 4 years out from being hit head on... i need opiates to maintain a normal life and even with my multiple surgeries and heaps of hardware, messed up back all i get is norco. I often wonder if its my addict hrain telling me these pills arent working or if im really just that messed up... its a struggle.

78^JaderedWulf^opiate^Well, maybe you'd think it funny to hear that I went the other way around... because in my world alcohol was not cool. You have no idea how much I wish it were. I was a saint on the booze. People have no idea how much I'm sacrificing, giving it up on their idealistic behalf. There legitimately wasn't *any* reason to witch-hunt me for it. But there you go.

Now I'm sneaking away hard-drugs because I can conceal an opiate high. \* smh \*

78^JaderedWulf^opiates^If you list all of opiates effects, anti-depression is at the very forefront of that list, in my opinion. I find opiates are much more remarkable for depression than for pain even.

78^JaderedWulf^opiates^Just generally spaced out / out of it. Feeling disconnected from reality as I'm interacting with it. Eye-contact feels more intense. The sense of space has been altered in a way I can't define. I'm kind of dizzy in a way I can't explain ‚Äì not at all like being drunk or anything like that... more like the same kind of dizziness you get on Subutex/Suboxone and/or Methadone, if you've ever tried that. Complex cognitive mental tasks are difficult ‚Äì I basically feel dumber. I was socially evasive... but a Valium and some opiates took care of that now. I would *not* like to get any higher than this!

I may very likely have an enzyme deficit. That may actually explain a lot of things.

78^JaderedWulf^opiates^I'm getting there myself. I used to always smoke a bowl for my night cap. Last night I was nodding out late in bed, thinking "oh, it's time to smoke a bowl... eh... on second thought I'd rather not."

Yeah... I'm starting to feel like weed taints the bliss from opiates.

78^JaderedWulf^black^Haha, this is awesome actually! Have you played Black Hole? That's my favorite one... I can play that one for hours. Pinball really gets the endorphins going.

78^JaderedWulf^opiates^Yeah same here. I don't have the patience, the nerves or even the care to deal with family-get-togethers and all that stuff I'm constantly involved now that I'm married. It's like it's not in my nature or something. But on opiates it's as if a switch goes off in my mind and I begin to even enjoy those things. It's kinda cheesy, but I legitimately feel the love in me...  and this deep appreciation for people. Almost like MDMA or something.

I'm toying with the everyday use, but I've taken day long breaks here and there and haven't felt any withdrawals (yet). 
But why I'd switch back to alcohol? It's hard to say really. It handles the social anxiety even better and I like the dynamic of it. There's a certain romance to it. It's more active and gives my personality a spring to it's step. I love how conversations just flow all night sipping a nice whiskey... etc. 
Plus I probably inherited my father's alcoholism so I guess there's this genetic affinity to it. When I drink it's like I feel a missing Lego piece snapping mentally back into place.

78^JaderedWulf^black^No, not exactly. The depth and form is similar, and the color-palette, and the vast black background... but the circular shapes consist more of what I would call cogwheels. Cogwheels riddled with ever-changing characters, letters, hieroglyphs... Most of the time I can't label/explain the type of characters/hieroglyphs I see, but some of them I could say are sort of Aztec in nature.

79^MissAnthrOpiate^opiate^You can look on the full sidebar to find more information on comparing opiate dosing and bioavailability.

79^MissAnthrOpiate^opiates^If you go to the sidebar of r/opiates,there are three links under the dosing section that apply to your post- one about bioavailability (which will answer the part about how to take the pills) and a link to an opioid comparison chart (which will compare strengths of opiates), and a link to opioid potentiators (which will give you info about what can make it stronger). It is all there.

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiate^I‚Äôve never taken Oxy‚Äôs (UK‚Äôs public health system prevented that epidemic here). 

But I have gone cold turkey twice from heavy opiate use and I couldn‚Äôt imagine working through the WDs for at LEAST a week. At least in my line of work it would have been impossible.

Yes the Tramadol likely will make you feel better, but it‚Äôs just another chemical that will antagonise your brain opiate receptors and prolong the duration of your natural repair and recovery. 

Everyone is different but I‚Äôd say that now you‚Äôre on a roll, call in work sick for at least the next 4-5 days. 

It‚Äôs gonna get worse before it gets better, day 3 will see your symptoms peak and you will start to slowly feel better from day 4 onwards. 

Good luck!

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiate^I‚Äôm on day 5 clean (after 10 years) and already realising how much I‚Äôve let shit slip, my body is a mess, my home is in disrepair, I‚Äôm earning less than I did 10 years ago. I‚Äôm paying back student loans for a degree I never finished. 

It‚Äôs already feeling like a mountain I can‚Äôt climb. Super tempting to just go back to that opiate safe place where these things don‚Äôt bother me. Fuck that shit though.

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiate^This explains why I was 3 weeks clean and starting to feel okay....then bam. I went back to feeling like I‚Äôd gone back to day 2 CT again. 
I‚Äôm doing okay again now, I just couldn‚Äôt understand what happened- i thought I might have taken some sort of opiate or an synthetic by mistake and gone back to acute withdrawals.

I thought PAWs only  manifested emotionally / thoughts/ cravings/ mood.

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiate^I think its exactly 3 weeks clean of opiates today.  Went on a hike today in the morning- grabbed an old coat to wear in the cold.. and found 3 pills  in the pocket. Got rid of them. Was only slightly tempted.  Had a great walk in nature with my amazing wife, I slipped on mud and fell on my ass in front of a group of strangers haha. Was in good spirits all day. 

Just chilling out now after a red hot bath, lay on the bed with clean sheets, listening to some a Dream Theatre. 
I‚Äôm starting to see how nice it can be to be clean.

Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm living sober because I tried Ket for the first time Friday night - that stuff is weird as hell, as I was tripping it really heightened my mind to how my body has gone into decline over the years of opiate abuse and all the time and opportunities I‚Äôve wasted- a very strange experience. Although I think it actually strengthened my resolve to stay away from the opiates. 

Hope you‚Äôre all doing well, have a great day everyone!

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiates^Some people don‚Äôt have the enzyme that converts opiates in your liver. They just can‚Äôt get high of them. It‚Äôs like a 1 in a million percentage- but with over 7 billion people on the planet it‚Äôs gonna happen to a lot

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiates^3 weeks today since I last used opiates! Actually went out and socialised last night with some old friends that I dropped out of contact with do to my self imposed isolation of using. 

It‚Äôs been a strange dazed and confused 3 weeks, still have urges here and there, and my legs are still restless and aching but overall I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and white knuckle it through. 

Good luck to everyone out there fighting the battle!

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^china^The rapid industrialisation of China means that millions of Chinese workers still have current ties to smaller towns and rural villages.

80^HasaDiga-Eebowai^opiate^Heroin withdrawals are NOT lethal.

You can‚Äôt count x2 deaths during a radical experimental procedure - as proof that Opiate withdrawals are deadly.
The procedure involved anaesthetising the patients as well as being extubated. 

One of the deceased was also an alcoholic.
The other reacted badly to the anaesthetic. 

Opiate addiction is a serious issue, and spreading such misinformation about it is harmful.

81^CevertJr^opiate^I have the capsules and they are 1 mg per capsule. And I‚Äôll take 12 or 15 sometimes and it just feels wrong to do. I hear it can fuck your liver up, after getting over a hardcore addiction I‚Äôd hate my self if I let a damn plant take me down. But if you use this drug how it‚Äôs intended it‚Äôs a god send. It really does feel like a opiate high it‚Äôs a good crutch for sure, but with a addictive personality it‚Äôs totally possible to get hooked. If you want the brand name I use you can pm me don‚Äôt want to get it removed idk if I can tell you over the comments. I‚Äôd take like 6 grams your first try but no more them 10 grams at a time to play it safe.

84^bathcigbomb^opiates^Welp I was gonna finally confess to my psychiatrist that I use kratom as a way to stay away from opiates. Nope, not anymore

84^bathcigbomb^opiate^I'm so sorry OP :( I had a pure bred husky that was my best friend for 15 years growing up. It was my mom's idea to get him but she didn't give a fuuuuuuuck about treating him right. I walked him for an hour and a half literally every single day until he was too old to walk. I bought him fancy dog food with my own money when I was under 18 and made sure to never feed him table scraps. He wasnt allowed upstairs so I slept on the couch next to him my entire childhood. He was my world. I remember begging my parents to take him to the vet because that's like a normal thing to do when you have a dog right? I realize the vet is expensive but my parents would yell at me whenever I asked and he NEVER went. I remember buying him tramadol online (mild human/animal opiate painkiller) because aspirin wasn't enough sometimes. I had a job at McDonald's but it wasn't enough to pay for the vet. When he got old, my mom suddenly started to "care" and made such a big deal about how well she was treating him like a month prior to his death. (And continues to) both my dad and my brother have acknowledged that she is full of shit and that I was his real care-taker. So that feels validating at least. (He was the family dog but everyone recognizes that I was his true "owner"). At least she didn't sell him away.... She would feed him pizza, milk, and other table scraps. He started gaining weight and all my years of walking him felt like it got flushed down the toilet. He was old af so it didn't really matter but I was always so pissed when I would find out that she fed him like half a pizza. She was "helping him". Evil fucking bitch. She accused me of walking him everyday so I could smoke cigarettes. I smoked cigs at home all the time anyways and didn't give a fuck if my parents saw me. That was bullshit.

When it came time to put him down, my mom wouldn't allow it. He was in so much pain and clearly past his time. It was heartbreaking seeing him alive everyday suffering so much. My entire family eventually yelled at my mom and we brought him to the vet to be put down. He should have been put down like 2 weeks if not a month prior to that though. He had super bad arthritis through his entire back and couldn't get out of bed. He was clearly miserable, so miserable to the point that I knew he needed to be put down (which is something I would never want but I knew it was his time, which shows how bad he was). 

Sorry for the huge rant I just remembered this as I was writing it. What's weird is I don't miss him at all, it's like his memory has been erased from my brain. But I'm thinking about him now as I'm writing this and it feels good. I should get another dog lol. Good for you for cutting contact, I need to do that. People that can't handle taking care of their pets should not have them. A husky requires to be walked everyday, my mom walked him less than 10 times in 15 years. If you can't commit to that, get a different fucking breed of dog!!! Or don't get one at all!!! I should be posting this from a throwaway but oh well 

Tldr: I had an awesome husky growing up

84^bathcigbomb^opiates^I'm probably too late but kratom. If you can get stronger opiates, that would be better. But kratom will help a lot

84^bathcigbomb^opium^You could probably defs get some opium in Thailand, ask around. I've done legitimate opium, smoked on foil and it was really comparable to smoking H or morphine high, just a lil weaker. The consistency was like shatter hash oil and tasted of poppy seeds. I got mine on the DW maybe 5 years ago and it came from Spain. There was a super cool vendor that used to exist, wish they still did. Anyone telling you opium tastes like flowers is lying. If I could get it again in the future, I would definitely consume orally. It's a waste but the duration and ability to dose high makes it worth it. Wish you luck homie!

84^bathcigbomb^black^Honestly for the sake of harm reduction, and since they're pressed, I would say don't take them because I don't want you ODing from bad advice from me. 

You could try an allergy test with a tiny speck and see what that does but there could still be hotspots somewhere in the pill. Did it come from a reputable vendor with good reviews? If so, you're probably safe. Also etiz isn't going to kill you that easily, at worst you will black out for a very long time. 

I'm an idiot so if it were me, I would just pop the whole thing. It looks like a high quality press so it's probably dosed somewhat accurately but that still doesn't mean anything. 

I'm sorry I don't have concrete advice. In the future, I reccomend buying powder and making your own solution and dosing volumetrically. Or buying a premade solution. You could try contacting your vendor and seeing what methods they use to mix their etizolam/binders. It almost looks like one of those presses they make in bulk in China and those are usually legit. But still, you never know. 

Edit: actually, if you want to be very safe, dissolve the pill in a measured amount (maybe 10mL) of water (actually don't use water, etiz isn't water soluble) or alcohol and dose a small amt with an oral syringe. From there, you can judge it's potency. At least that way, the contents will be uniform. Be safe mi friend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
85^SeaRecord7^dreams^okay yeah i definitely didnt have that last night, like sure i was a tad happy but just placebo and i was basically just a little more tired... but sleeping was great and the dreams were good if that has anything to do with it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
86^lonewolf19891^china^That's true I don't think they controlled it well some could say tried to hide it from the world as the first case was November but then there is also this thing with China and America so who knows what's really going on there too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
87^Camelsmoke^opiates^this made me laugh but I gotta say Kratom helped me get off opiates so I respect it now lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
88^tha9ine^opiates^They are better than other opiates in my opinion they are probably me second favorite pill so have a good time and let yourself relax

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
89^xaniel_da_throwaway^opiate^I have heard about most of these unfortunately and that is why I am trying to quit. The community told me it is 100% safe and a cure for everything from depression to opiate addiction. I started it to deal with depression and it worked at first. I now realize how fucking dumb it was to use an opioid for depression. 

The one thing I will say in defense of it is that in my (and many other people that I know) experience, dangerous overdose is incredibly hard to reach. I know many kratom users who are stupid about it and take multiple doses of extract while really drunk or on benzos and just end up vomiting really badly at worst. Not saying that it can‚Äôt cause respiratory depression, it just is a lot milder than most opioids when it comes to that (I know people that have overdosed off of 30mg of hydrocodone and a few drinks). 

However:

Most days I wake up in cold sweats. I don‚Äôt want to do drugs at all but I know that I will feel better when I take it. It fucking sucks.

I understand why it should be available to people. It helps people quit hard opiates. I would 100% rather have a loved one on kratom than heroin or booze. From the limited medical knowledge I have (from researching all of these drugs) it is a partial opioid agonist (mu-opioid receptor) kind of like buprenorphine right? I have heard many people say it is like ‚Äúhippie suboxone,‚Äù because it is a natural herb that works like subs (without the naloxone obviously). 

As far as I am concerned, myself as well as all of my friends are concerned about it. I hate having to take it but I also need something to use to relieve stress. I deal with anxiety and depression pretty bad and SSRIs have not helped. Cannabis gives me anxiety and I am aware that alcohol is horrible as a crutch. I know that I could go to detox and then inpatient rehab but I am in school and really don‚Äôt want to take time off as this habit isn‚Äôt life threatening (right now at least).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
90^throwaway489597^opioid^Yeah this is most definitely the culprit. I've never done an opioid in my life apart from a miniscule 2mg morphine dose at the ER, so I assume jumping right to heroin was probably a shock for my poor little body

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
91^nymphinnite^black^Nope! Its honestly really just puppets or dolls. I think it stems from my childhood as a kid I was obsessed with Barney and had a Barney doll that I took every where. One night it glitched out and it would not. Stop. Talking. I threw it in the closet and could still here it all skipping and shit. I woke my mom up and she took the batteries out but I could SWEAR that thing kept making noises... i never had another doll lmao. And besides, do you see Alfs beady and lifeless black hole in hell of EYES that hes got???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
92^OrangeKlip^opiates^Wow I honestly can‚Äôt fathom how someone wouldn‚Äôt love opiates, unless it made them sick to the stomach. They perfectly mimic natural pleasure endorphins so I assume the high should be universally pleasurable.

92^OrangeKlip^opiates^Oh yeah I would get chatty as hell back in the day on low doses too. Would always chat up my parents at night and they would never know a thing since opiates hardly impair me.

92^OrangeKlip^opiate^Yes very. I‚Äôve seen reports of opiate addicts not even being constipated due to heavy nicotine use.

92^OrangeKlip^opioid^Honestly man a lot of withdrawal is in your head. I highly doubt 50 mg of oxy total downregulated your natural opioid production much at all. Like that‚Äôs literally hardly anything, not even a point. You‚Äôre fine, just believe in yourself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
93^AfricanSuperBaeng^opiate^Methadone has become my favorite opi recently (after heroin, of course) for two reasons. 
1. Unlike suboxone, I can actually get a decent buzz from it.
2. It costs me barely anything compared to any other opiate. If I'm doing heroin or oxys I probably will have to spend about $100-200 a day, but methadone only costs me about $10-30 for a full day of being high.

93^AfricanSuperBaeng^opiate^Personally most opiates are very easy on the tummy for me, I rarely get nauseus or vomit on any opiate no matter what dosage, so I'm not sure if I'm the right person to ask. The only opioid I occationaly puke on (1/100 chance) is subs for some reason, so it is at least nicer than buprenorphine.


But if you are having problems with nausea and vomiting i recommend that you eat something if you feel the nausea creeping on. Lying down on my back for a few minutes also helps, and antihistamines also help.
If nothing works the best solution is to go puke and get it over with, as it is a surefire way to feel like a reborn man.

93^AfricanSuperBaeng^opiate^Yeah, back when I was a opiate noob I used to get a full night of nods and euphoria from just about 0,5-1 mg of subutex, good times. Now I just use it occasionally to keep the withdrawals away or to taper off, and my dose is usually 8 mg. As I don't live in the states I've never had the strips, only the pills with and without naloxe. I always snort or boof them which I think has far greater bioavailability than doing the sublingually.


The bottle on the picture actually contains liquid methadone, so it's just one dose. I've got a few more bottles in my stash.
I've recently had some 40 mg capsules of methadone though, from France. They actually were much better than the liquid stuff I've got now, even though I'm taking the exact same dose, which is kinda weird since it's the same amount of the same chemical as far as I know.
I don't have any pics of the French capsules, but I'm getting some more next week or so, might post a picture then.

93^AfricanSuperBaeng^opiates^Yeah, that's what I mean, there is a lot of drug user who do stuff like coke and ecstasy but would never try opiates. If they get one of those fent pills and don't test them they will certainly die. 
Some dealers are fucking morons, why would you kill your customers, how's that good for business..?

93^AfricanSuperBaeng^opiate^Sounds like a killer combo tbh, I would probably try it out if I had the chance.

 My issue is that the average coke user is probably not an avid opiate user as well, and without any tolerance or even not even knowing about the fent in the coke they buy sounds a recipe for disaster, almost straight up murder.

93^AfricanSuperBaeng^opiate^Yeah I usually stick to just doing opiates, I do benzos and stims very rarely compared to my opiate usage. I just helped my dboy out with some weed and I got the benzos and amphetamine for free, so I figured I might as well go all in for once. My opiate tolerance is through the roof so I can handle pretty high doses with some benzos involved. But thanks for the warning!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
94^throwawaymightstay^opiates^this is pretty normal imo. i use opiates for physical pain but also for emotional pain. been on them for over ten years and there have been a countless number of times i used them instead of attempting suicide. this will probably be an annoying question but do you get psychotherapy? my psych has me working a sort of plan where i stabilize my doses and practice harm reduction. my goal is to get off them eventually but know i cant cope without them rn. i often consider methadone programs but for now, i get them from a pain management specialist. i really am not here to tell you to buy off the street or wait but i think there is a benefit to stabilising your dose so you can observe how you feel on a day to day basis. all i know is i have cptsd and depression and they work more than my seroquel and lexapro. told my doctor last week, he didnt react well. anyway best of luck. ive been where you are/still kinda am and i know its not easy.

Edit: what frustrates me most is that smoking and drinking arent a big deal at all to doctors despite their very well documented links to cancer and organ failure but you tell a doctor pain killers help you cope, you are treated like junkie scum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
95^nnnicknnn0^opiates^Does grape fruit juice potentiate Adderall and opiates too? And also is there a way to replenish my enzymes? I didn't abuse it for too long maybe like 40mg every day for a week and then I slowed down after that to like a bottle every month or 2 so the damage shouldn't be too bad unless they were already sensitive in the first place. I also took really big breaks in between after I lost the magic and it's slowly coming back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
96^BrokenHorseLegs^opioid^Narcos give you that warm fuzzy feeling, my preferred opioid.

Wippits sometimes, a nice vape hit will give you that feeling. 

Puppy's, hugs, and drugs basically.

96^BrokenHorseLegs^black^Same, had a similar situation a year back, I'm like "oh fuck, they want to do a breathing test... I'm fucked" but no, I'm fine lol.

Thank God for vaping, if it was cigs I'd have black lungs by now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
97^BCD195^dreams^I don‚Äôt have dreams while stoned. I typically don‚Äôt have dreams as is, but if I smoke for a couple months straight I won‚Äôt have any untill 3 or 4 days after I stop. 

I also cannot sleep whatsoever if I don‚Äôt smoke so it‚Äôs a rough situation because I also need to pass drug tests for my work :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
98^muntcake^opiate^Exactly this. I brought up the naltrexone shot with my suboxone doctor and he listed these exact reasons. He's been working with opiate addicts for 20 years and said not once did he ever see someone succeed using naltrexone alone. People don't just become addicts out of nowhere and turning off your ability to feel one drug doesn't fix it. And it's mainly used to treat alcoholism now. He said I should look into bupe shots, which is apparently gaining popularity and seeing good results in Australia. If you're sick of the annoying daily pharmacy run that comes with methadone or suboxone, anyway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
99^InvertedValues^dreams^It seems almost virtually reality-esque in many ways. Like its purpose is to put you through reality-based 'simulated' experiences. Almost like the way dreams work ü§î

The immersion of Salvia definitely seems interesting to me but also daunting lol

99^InvertedValues^black^Legal drugs or psychoactive household products don't tend to be that safe. So you have to weigh the medical and health side of things against the angst of procuring from the black market and decide which one you're willing to settle for.

99^InvertedValues^dreams^False memories like confabulation? Or mixing up dreams with reality (DRC)?

Because I think *confabulation* and *dream-reality confusion* are distinct from each other but wow that's interesting. Never knew DPH could confabulate. Makes sense though. I haven't quite experienced that.

99^InvertedValues^dreams^Do dreams become conflated with waking reality like with nightshades? Like I would dream I found a $100 bill and then later that morning after waking up I will reach in my pocket for the bill and then realizing that was just a dream I had.

99^InvertedValues^dreams^Yeah from what it sounds like I'm thinking it may just have this dimensional/temporal  feeling to it. Like dreams, parallel universes and reality folds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
100^072kutkind^china^This honestly makes me mad, recently I've seen so much plain racism online to China

100^072kutkind^opiates^As you might be able to tell I'm a severe crack addict and I can only enjoy holding conversations about opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
101^taxinun^opiate^i‚Äôm a dick to people sometimes, ill admit that. but usually only to the people who ask the same questions over and over - mostly heroin / opiate users. 

i see the same questions a million times a day 

‚Äòhow long after suboxone can i use heroin‚Äô 
‚Äòhow long after taking oxycodone can i take xanax‚Äô 
‚Äòcan i mix xanax and percocet‚Äô 

no one ever uses the sidebar, no one ever searches anything before posting, and i‚Äôve never seen an active mod on this sub: which all leads to me being a dick and saying ‚Äòuse the fucking search bar‚Äô

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
102^Dirty_D_Damnit^cruz^Was going through Conor's fight history on wikipedia. Holy shit I wish I could go back in time and watch UFC 178 live. The names on that card are crazy. The prelims had kevin lee, wonerboy, masvidal, and dominick cruz all getting wins. Then on the main card Romero, mcgregor dustin, cerrone actually getting a big time win over alvarez, and mighty mouse as the headliner. I would straight jerk it to this card if it was on tomorrow night.

102^Dirty_D_Damnit^black^I don't like Ari at all and I personally think he is a big asshole.... but good or bad isn't exactly some black and white situation. Maybe he has done tons of good things behind the scenes that we don't know about. Not defending Ari because, well, fuck Ari. Just trying to provide a different angle

102^Dirty_D_Damnit^opiates^> Part of this includes stopping opiates, but I‚Äôm not well enough to attend meetings or therapy yet. 

what do you mean by this? Are your concussion symptoms so bad you basically can't do anything? How'd you get the concussion? (Sorry for all of the questions) I think I'm a little confused by the whole PCS thing, never really heard much about it.

> How about you? What has your recovery looked like?

I wouldn't say my recovery is perfect or even remotely close to it. I binge eat from time to time, I haven't done the steps yet, I don't regularly go to meetings. With all of that said, my life is incredible and I am very lucky to be where I am. I really try to stay positive in every situation, it isn't always easy and sometimes it feels wrong... but I consciously force myself to see the positive in everything. I don't try to impose my way of life on anyone else, I don't tell people what they should or shouldn't do. I try my best to be understanding of everyone and every situation.

Like I said, not perfect at all but I really try my best to be understanding and see the good in people. I find that this has helped me immeasurably in my recovery. You can't control everyone and everything like we would like to be able to. So for me, the best option is trying to understand why someone does something, or how they became the way they are.

I heard some story about this guy speeding on the high way by all of this traffic in the shoulder lane. Everyone sees this guy speed by and assumes he is just some fucking dickhead. Well a cop pulls him over. The guy points to the baby in the back seat and he isn't breathing. The cop lets him go speed off to the hospital. Everyone has a baby in the back seat of their car, we just don't know what it is.

102^Dirty_D_Damnit^cruz^I absolutely can't stand Trump and I want Bernie to win. If the DNC straight up rigs the primaries again that is about the only thing that could get me to not vote democrat in the next election. I can at least admire the fact that the Republican party stood behind Trump as their guy despite being an absolute fucking retard. Imagine if they had rigged Cruz to win the nomination over Trump or something like that? Would have been ridiculous

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
103^jojojoneees^china^I have had really negative experiences with them. I got a pallete and it was absolutely awful, and colourpop makes even cheaper palletes that perform beautifully so I don‚Äôt see why morphe has to be so shitty. Also other brands private label from china and are good quality like juvia‚Äôs place so i don‚Äôt see why morphe shadows are that chalky

103^jojojoneees^opiates^Honestly benzos and opiates. Hang in there, my dad did tons of rounds of chemo and he‚Äôs the same as ever, binge drinking and fucking around all night (not that thats good but he‚Äôs the same as always I mean)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
104^ilikechemsalot^black^Ok so might get flamed for this.  40mg A-PHP and .1g of black tar heroin in the same syringe.  It's better than sex.  It's better than coffee and dope iv. It's better than meth iv. It's better than mdma iv. I never thought anything could top cokes iv rush but this takes the cake.  Also.  High doses come with a free manic auditory hallucination üë®‚ÄçüíªüòÖ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
105^drbdub^opioid^I personally would not waste the opioid that would be lost in extraction or my time. That is just me!  If I had an unhealthy liver, took other hepatotoxic meds or planned on making this a regular treat, I would do a CWE. Only you know the details. 

I am NOT recommending this, but even if you took all 15 you would be over the daily max acetaminophen by only ~900mg. During the peak of my pill addiction, there were days when  I was taking 10-15 tabs of the 10/500mg Lortabs 3-4 times per day.  This is a ridiculous amount of acetaminophen and I am lucky me and my liver are alive and kicking today. 

Enjoy!!

105^drbdub^opiate^Depends on several factors. The big distinguishing point is if you have already had a cycle of use and withdrawal before. 

If this is your first period of continuous use,  it can take 6 months of daily or almost daily use. 

If you have already experienced the hell of opiate withdrawal....it depends on how far you have progressed in your addiction. It takes less and less time of using to experience full blown withdrawals the farther you go and the more episodes of withdrawal you experience.   I have been through the ringer with opiate addiction, and for me anything over 1.5 to 2 days, and I pay with 7-10 days of acute opioid withdrawal. 

Hope this helps!

105^drbdub^dreams^Freedom, sanity, dreams, relationships, self worth. 
....but if you buy in bulk you can get a deal.

105^drbdub^opiate^Looks like a histamine reaction not a missed shot or an abscess. An abscess takes days to form. Histamine reaction is a common side effect of opiate use. Especially IV. Put some ice on it and take a Benadryl. You will be fine.

105^drbdub^opiate^Any opiate can stop withdrawal from any other opiate. You just have to take enough if the ‚Äúrescue‚Äù opiate is not as strong as the one you were addicted to.  In your case it would take about 360mg to be equal to 150mg of oxy daily. Keep in mind that every body is different and like someone else said you may have to play around with the dose but should be able to get well enough to function. You won‚Äôt get high on codeine!!

Good luck!

105^drbdub^opiate^No it doesn‚Äôt. It is a full opiate agonist with average binding affinity. Suboxone is a partial opiate agonist with very strong binding affinity (the reasons it causes PWD).

105^drbdub^opiate^Hmm. You might try boofing for maximum bioavailability. I wouldn‚Äôt expect much from that dose. The starting dose for opiate naive and for just simple pain relief is 15mg.

105^drbdub^opiate^If I understood your post correctly you are coming off of subs. Bupe, the active partial agonist opiate, has a very long half life. The reason why using every 1-3 days was keeping your body in a steady state of opioid intoxication, and making the detox the same as coming off of a daily use habit. 

PAWS is real but it isn‚Äôt what you are experiencing. PAWS is kind of like a ‚Äúbrain zap‚Äù that occurs seemingly out of nowhere and tricks your brain and body into being in withdrawal. It can be 6 months (or even up to 18) after you are done with the acute withdrawal and you are hit with the yawns and cold chills or sudden diarrhea and anxiety, etc.   it usually is very short lived and decreases in frequency as the weeks go by. 

What you are experiencing is the long hellish detox from subs. It can be 3-4 weeks of the acute phase with some lessening of symptoms about halfway through (just like regular opiate withdrawal, only halfway is 2 weeks instead of 2 or 3 days).  So, no it isn‚Äôt PAWS, but you aren‚Äôt crazy...you are still detoxing. Hopefully each day will get a little better than the last from here in out. 

Congrats on your progress!!  Keep up the good work!

105^drbdub^opiates^Ha ha!  Yes....used as a filter instead of a wheel filter for anything being injected. Pills or heroin (or any other shitty class of drug that isn‚Äôt opiates!).

105^drbdub^chocolate^I am not sure exactly what you mean but I am going to take a stab. If you take your presses pill and cut it into quarters you have no idea the dose within each quarter. Pharmaceutical pills are made with consistent active ingredient dosing. 

This means a 50 mg pill that is cut in half will have two equal 25mg halves. A pressed pill that contains 50mg active ingredients could potentially have 0mg in one held and 50mg in the other half. 

Fent presses pills are very dangerous because of these ‚Äúhot spots.‚Äù  Fent is prone to clumping and not being dispersed equally and is often compared to a chocolate chip. How many chocolate chips will be in your next bite??  None or enough to send you to your grave??

Take care and be safe!!

105^drbdub^opiates^Just a histamine reaction. Common side effect of opiates. They cause mast cell de granulation which releases histamine. 

Take some Benadryl beforehand if it really bothers you. It is nothing to worry about and does not mean you are allergic to the dope. 

Take care!!

105^drbdub^opiate^The fatuous attempts to catch a buzz from bupe. We all try it!  Rarely do we succeed!  Maybe the opiate naive, or like TAT said, the first 1-2 days of taking it, there might be a slight head change.  Either nothing happens or adverse events are encountered. Nausea and headache are the two most common. It should pass in 1.5-2 days. Do what TAT said and I would add taking some ginger products. If you have a prescription for promethazine or odansetron, that would be the most helpful. 

Hope you feel better soon!  Good luck on your recovery. ....and from experience, just get your mind to believe you will have zero luck at getting high on bupe, it will save you frustration and more nausea!

105^drbdub^opiates^Well I guess the Suboxone blocked all your opiates??

7+ Lortabs a day is not a huge dose by the way. People legitimately taking a prescription take that much.

105^drbdub^opiate^You are welcome. 

As long as there is enough water to put the opiate into suspension...it shouldn‚Äôt really matter. However, I would go for a smaller amount of water over a large amount just because it will absorb faster and have less chance of being absorbed by the stool. What size syringe are you using?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
106^0424reddit^dreams^Reassure yourself that one day that dream will be a reality when the time is right for you. You‚Äôre a capable and hopefully healthy individual who will be able to carry a baby one day. I have had dreams like that too and have been so Inlove with my baby and just holding and looking at them was so beautiful only to wake up and realize it was all a dream finding myself feeling disappointed which always surprises me because I‚Äôm actually not a big fan of children and I‚Äôm only 20 lol but I guess that is the motherly instincts that we have inside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
107^throwit102486^opiate^Did you abuse the Methadone or chase a high in the clinic to the point of extreme high doses? No offense but this is exactly what happens when you abuse an opiate, eventually it stops working because your tolerance is so high from going to extreme doses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
108^Atomicfrylock^opiates^Just try kratom if your interested in opiates. With no tolerance. A good kratom extract will have you feeling nice. Don't start heroin it's a bad idea. I've been on it for years. Crashed my car damn near died. Broke both my legs. My hip.  Back. Arm.  Still wasn't enough to stop me. The day I got out the hospital. I had saved up several 4mg dilaudid they were giving me and bought an 80 of h.  I used a Walker to get a quarter mile to meet my dude in the driveway. And hobbled back in side.

108^Atomicfrylock^opiates^I'm more into. H an other opiates. But when  I'm without. I'll take some stims. To overthrow the withdrawals. Keeping these for when that time comes

108^Atomicfrylock^china^Most china in the us is fent h mix.  So no the doses wouldn't be equivalent.

108^Atomicfrylock^opiates^Bro. Enjoy the crack of opiates.  Damn makes my stomach churn seeing that.  

Bang one for me bruv

108^Atomicfrylock^opiate^All set mates.  I want to thank everyone  at r/opiates  for the support and BD 100unit insulin syringe.    Thanks to my job for being ignorant and getting money to support my self and my habits and to live happily with my delight of a girlfriend.  And I love reddit opiate family as well.   All the love and support on this sub reddit  of users addicts and all in between is an absolutely beautiful thing.

108^Atomicfrylock^opiates^I used to take somas before I even knew how good they were with opiates. And wondered why inwas so god damn high as a 20 year old.  My buddy. Who passed away. Bless and rest his soul. His grandma used to give us her bottle every time she picked up her script.  And would sell me the orange norco 7.5s for 1.50 a piece. I'd cwe 20 of em. Gulp the water pop 4 or 5 soma  and be In that soma coma.  Haven't had any since I realized how good they were.  But enjoy my man.

108^Atomicfrylock^opiates^It's s nice crisp beer especially after a shift in the factory. Plus some Xans to go with it all thatw missing is some opiates.  Hope you enjoi it bucko

108^Atomicfrylock^opiates^Thanks man. There for a while. They didn't think I was gonna make it.  My stomach was swelled up like 5 times the size of normal.   I was on a 24 hour watch. And life support for 3 days. Cause not only did I od on whatever rc benzo that was in that h.  I slammed into a tree going close to 100.

 The engine came back in the car and crushed my legs. Shit was crazy man. Being a vegetable when I wrecked and no seat belt saved me.  Oeople was saying god saved me or whatever. 

But I'm a believer in a higher power.  And when I was out of it. I was in a orange blue and gold type realm. Lots of energy and something in that place transferred energy to me that kept me alive.  People say they see the light or whatever. Well this was something  similar  to that.  My perception of this was like  place where life and death worked together. And o remember when I first heard my grandparents and girlfriends voice. And the joy I felt in my heart.   When I felt the touch of my gf hand. And didn't realize I bit my toinge in half when I wrecked. But I was trying to tell her what.  Damn what a ride man and for once even with opiates in my system when I 3as admitted. I wasn't under treated. Till the bitch ass doctor I was assigned noticed the drug test results and gave me the terrible BA of oral dilaudid  5o msk4 sure I wasn't getting high. I wonder if they realize about bio availability of drugs. But he was such and asshole.  Just the tone of his know it all voice  made me blood red mad. He was such an idiot there was a vacuum to keep fluid out of my groin cut and I told him where it was leaking and he argued with me bout nag nah its here. Well he did all of what he thought it was.  Still was leaking air and the sensor beeping. Well I asked him to let me try and I fixed it.  The look in his face was priceless. Mr I got a doctorate so I'm automatically smarter than you.  Can't stand people with that kind of social complex.   I have a associate's in chemistry. And I never belittled or talked down to anyone. 

Sorry for the rant. Just broughtbl back alot of memories. Cause my favorite doctor died a few days after i was moved. He was truly an understanding realist doc. That of course the other docs looked down on him cause he was the youngest one. And treated people unique to there situation such as I. Tried to make the new doctor understand that I know what works best for me and pain but not only did he not consider it. After the fact of him asking me what I thought would work.   And not once was I ever nodding out while there besides the 12mg dilaudid shots or when I shot my own. Damn. I was slick. One night I wheel chaired out to the parking garage and met my dealer and got a g of h and he delivered my PSP so I could play gta. He was the real mvo and tossed that dope after i told him it was a bad mix and that it was gonna kill someone.  


Sorry for ranting. I just haven't felt that kind of passion to speak on something like that. Glad to be bwk

109^Feliche1^dreams^Very relaxed, some small hallucinations, a euphoric felling and (now a bad one) insanely tired some times. I also feel 0% of anxiety and this is amazing. I also have some taughts that I would not have sober.

I‚Äôve seem a dude saying that he had some lucid dreams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
110^Ravioli_Kiwioli^black^Thanks, it also has a shortcut that goes underground that you cant see, which is pitch black, and you can only use 3 night vision potions to get out of it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
111^Zidviziouz^china^Actually, if you truly look into it, you will find that the drugs that are currently being synthesized are ones that are not scheduled in NL and China as well as India. There are tons of substances available that are banned by US laws, the impact is minimal if any.

111^Zidviziouz^china^MXE in China? Have my doubts about that honestly. Would be extremely skeptical of any non clandestine lab claiming to be making MXE.

111^Zidviziouz^china^I have a feeling he was phishing for PMs to present a fake seller. Don't see China making MXE and DCK seeing as how they are illegal there. The Chinese don't seem to fuck around when it comes to banned substances. Corporal punishment is no joke.

112^Mr_Jack_Frost_^opiates^Kratom helped me quit a 2 year hard drug habit. Goodbye heroin, pain pills, and meth. Hello wonderful helpful leaves. When I was tapering off the opiates my doses were higher (6g 3 times daily) but I was able to lower my kratom dose over time to 3-5g once daily, on days when I take kratom, which is now about 3-4 days a week. The days I do not take kratom I feel no urge to take it, it's just an optional supplement. It really is a wonderful plant, and has helped me more than I can properly express.

112^Mr_Jack_Frost_^opiate^When I was using kratom to get off traditional opiates my usual dose was around 5.5-6g and I found it perfectly comparable to a traditional opiate high, though without the intense side effects and the overall synthetic feeling I would get from taking pills or street h. It's a wonderful plant, and it helped me get clean. I also don't wake up the next day feeling like I need kratom, regardless of how much I take in a day.

112^Mr_Jack_Frost_^opioid^I used to do CWE with percocet/acetaminophen. Was always paranoid there was still apap in the mix, and was worried the damage I was doing to my liver. So far as I can tell moderate kratom usage has no major health impact, and it makes it a lot easier to enjoy the experience guilt free. Codeine is a very weak opioid and imo kratom can deliver more of that bodily euphoria than Codeine in the correct dose, with the correct strain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
113^HeyPaniniKs^black^I used to be a huge black metal fan and I highly reccomend Rotting Christ if you want to explore the genre.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
114^orangejuiceisbetter^opiates^How come people like codeine so much? I have definitely sipped lean and it doesn‚Äôt do that much for me. I love hydrocodone and oxy so much more and it‚Äôs more powerful, codeine is relatively weak in comparison. Is it more of the ritualistic part of actually drinking it or you just enjoy the high over other opiates?

114^orangejuiceisbetter^opiates^look i have taken too much opiates (oxy and hydrocodone) before on multiple occasion and it was nowhere near a lethal dose, that shit will hit ur stomach and u will feel very sick before anything else. i honestly beleive unless u take it all the time u will throw up before the drug and kill you. But yea blowing ur head off is the best way, and don‚Äôt do it either. Suicides devastating to those around you i have experienced this first hand. You can really fuck someone‚Äôs life up u care about by committing suicide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
115^paradox1126^black^Ahh! It's all good. I'm the black sheep and it's not like I'm not used to it.  You're user name made me laugh!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
116^temp1562106^black^It‚Äôs called compulsive redosing, basically you black out and just keep taking xans until you pass tf out or you finish your stash

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
117^strangegeneration94^cruz^I gotta admit, I found this video pretty surprising. I wasn't expecting that. 

But my question is:

What are the circumstances that lead up to this? I mean, with someone like Cruz, I would've expected him to be locked away in a cell, completely shielded off from  all human contact. What was he doing walking around in that room?

117^strangegeneration94^black^There's a lot of them. But just to name a few:

118^Mothinrust^opiate^Honesty is not always the best policy. Specifically in relation to this topic. I told my therapist just yesterday. ‚Äú I refuse to be honest about my opiate struggles because if I‚Äôm ever in pain in the future I want proper treatment. I refuse to be treated like some piece of shit drug seeker when I‚Äôm in actual discomfort‚Äù and all she could say was ‚Äúthat actually makes a lot of sense‚Äù. I had a for instance of course. So it wasn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario. I‚Äôve experienced the way they treat people who are on suboxone. And magically since I‚Äôve been off it I‚Äôve been treated like a human being again. Because apparently that information isn‚Äôt readily available to every doctor you see. Specifically when you make a big deal about it and tell them ‚ÄúIm no longer on that medication and I want it removed from my records‚Äù. We are still people are we still have the right to proper medical treatment. Fuck anybody that tries to make a person feel bad for a drug addiction. Especially considering it was the piece of shit doctors that started this whole epidemic because they‚Äôre greedy fucks.

118^Mothinrust^opiates^There is nothing else on the planet that feels like hydromorphone. Which is why it‚Äôs so deadly and addictive. I personally get a lot from the right strains of weed. But it‚Äôs nothing like being high on opiates

118^Mothinrust^opioid^What a crazy ass drug! I‚Äôd be lying if the description of it didn‚Äôt intrigue me. I would love to have an opioid that gave me that kind of energy. But at the same time. I‚Äôll happily stay away. As long as I live I‚Äôm never gonna get
dope sick or benzo sick again.

118^Mothinrust^opiate^I get almost nothing from kratom. Maybe I‚Äôve yet to try the right strain or whatever.  But I currently have no opiate tolerance been ‚Äúsober‚Äù for a little over a year. Friend gave me some the other day for giving him a ride home for court. I figured wth I‚Äôm bored and I haven‚Äôt slept. Took it in hot water at his house. By the time I got back to my place my mood was elevated and I had more energy. But this was short lived. Kratom just doesn‚Äôt do it for me.

118^Mothinrust^china^Haha well that‚Äôs a whole different discussion. And it‚Äôs impossible to police every kid that uses the DNM to purchase fent. Part of the problem is corruption and our history of funding covert operations with drug money. China and mexican drug cartels are long helping. But it‚Äôs definitely America‚Äôa bullshit war on drugs that is primarily causing this problem. All of our heroin is cut with fentanyl. So there would be no way to police just fentanyl in America. The U.K. is just different man and I‚Äôm glad you guys took care of that problem your way. But it would never work in the states that way even if the police were actually trying to do the right thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
119^ImpellentSmoke^opiate^Personally after having runs with both I can say heroin is more addictive than meth by far even though I truly enjoyed both. There is absolutely nothing like heroin, it's one of those drugs that everyone says stay away from but when you first try it out it just feels like your regular opiate just a little better imo. Then its an on and off thing that's not that big of a deal until your doing it everyday. Months go by and now it cost more than you'd care to admit just to stay well and when I say you're gonna change I mean it. fucked up shit doesn't seem as fucked up as it use to as long as your getting your fix. Then you get tired of spending all your money to just be okay and then you face a choice a needle or quit. And then it happens again I recently picked up the needle and I can say that I don't even want to quit. I do but something about a good shot of dope just outweighs most of the bullshit that comes with this life and it's not a life you want to live. 
Heroin addiction is sneaky and will get you and once you get "got" your trapped... Be careful out there if you need someone to talk to I'm here

119^ImpellentSmoke^opiates^I thought it was cap too honestly I was on and off of opiates including heroin for years but this last run is the one that got me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
120^FriskySteve01^black^It wasn‚Äôt bright white but instead egg shell as they called. Dell was considered revolutionary to have made black computers lol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
121^Br1ngTh3Ruckus^opiates^The cravings at the moment are purely a result of boredom, insomnia, and depression.  It's nothing compared to the first week but I still have to take one day at a time.

I was also a chronic relapser also.  I would go a week or two and then relapse for a few months for about a year straight.  It eventually got to the point where I got so sick of my life revolving around the plug and never having money that I decided to try Suboxone.  It came down to having to learn to live again and Suboxone has allowed me to do that.  I only take the bare minimum to make me feel normal which is 2mg.  Once I'm able to go through the days without even thinking about opiates or feel strong enough I'll try to taper off.

Some people claim you're not clean if you're on Suboxone but I think otherwise.  Are you still engaging in the same behavior you did on H?  Probably not.  Most people's lives turn around completely on Subs, mine sure did.

Although it's still a bit of a struggle even on Suboxone, let me tell you the good it has brought me which would not be the case if I was still using H.  I'm starting to save money which has also allowed me to treat myself, for example, I bought a Nintendo switch.  I have significantly more time which I've used to begin fixing my relationships with family and friends, can spend more time with my dog making sure he has a happy life, can work on projects I've avoided, going back to school, and overall trying to make up for everything I could have done if I was not using.

We have the choice to become and do whatever we want.  I never really realized this until recently but it's 100% up to us if we want a good life or not.  As addicts we expect instant gratification but that's just not realistic.  Working towards a goal and then achieving it is so much more rewarding than getting high for a few hours and then having to worry if you'll have more for tomorrow sucks.

I feel like I'm preaching now but you get the point.  It sounds like you really want to be clean and that's a great first step!  Imagine the person you will be making it through.  Most of the population aren't aware of what we have to go through on a daily basis.  Think of how much stronger that actually makes us.

Are you planning on going CT or doing MAT?  Happy to answer any questions you have, I've been through it all...

121^Br1ngTh3Ruckus^opiates^Have you considered going to an actual Suboxone clinic and tapering off the correct way?  I don't see why people put themselves in these situations, especially with Suboxone.  Why even bother buying it off the street?  If you're still going to abuse opiates just use the real stuff lol...

121^Br1ngTh3Ruckus^opiate^Some people claim the dose varies across the strip but I don't find that to be the case and most people taper by cutting them.  Plus, the half-life is so long that if the dose did very slightly it would be negligible.

BTH with fent in it!?  Wtf!?  I'm glad I got out.  Anyways, with fent you want to absolutely be in withdrawal before taking Sub, usually 24+hrs.  The best method to gauge if you're ready is to score a 10+ on the COWS(Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale).  Start at a low dose so if PWD does occur it will be minimal.

COWS: https://www.mdcalc.com/cows-score-opiate-withdrawal

121^Br1ngTh3Ruckus^gum^What dose are you on?  Suboxone doesn't really cause suppressed breathing.

I would contribute this more to vaping.  I switched from cigs to vaping and it's making me feel much worse breathing wise.  Going to switch to gum today.

121^Br1ngTh3Ruckus^gum^I'm switching to nicotine gum after my last Juul pod because it's just making me feel awful.  I originally bought an eCig to quit real cigarettes but am noticing these vapes are really making my lungs and chest hurt.

Fuck the vapes haha...

121^Br1ngTh3Ruckus^opiate^We sound very similar, that's about how much Sub and how often I would use also.  Did you feel off at all when jumping back onto only Subs?  I can't remember but it's almost like I would get an opiate hangover the day after.  Deep down I'm trying to rationalize using lol...  After all, there's a couple points sitting right next to me.  Sooo tempting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
122^Donny_Donowitz99^dreams^That's the devil man, don't let him work his way in through your dreams! Shrug it off and worry about today

122^Donny_Donowitz99^opiates^I don't know what you mean by possible. Of course it's possible. Not everyone that does opiates is an addict. I'd say the majority is, but there are those that aren't

122^Donny_Donowitz99^opiates^I used to be like that, but then after a few months it turned into one line = a 3 day binge where the high stopped being fun after a day and a half, but I just couldn't stop. Eventually I have, and I gotta say I don't miss it. Now opiates, them I love and my next project is gonna be stopping those

122^Donny_Donowitz99^opiates^You're good man. People stop breathing on opioids because they are respiratory depressants. That means opiates slow down your breathing. People don't overdose because they fall asleep, they fall asleep because they're overdosing (unless they're just nodding off) Overdosing has to do with how much you take. Sleeping doesn't make you more likely to overdose. Long story short, falling asleep after using opiates makes no difference in your probability of overdosing.

122^Donny_Donowitz99^black^I came back to say yeah I think you're right. I just used a skewer to scrape everything out of my Tooter (it looked like brown dust) and as soon as I heated it it turned back into a piece of black. At least a dimes worth. It got me pretty fucked up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
123^GodsBringerbitch^opiates^I used to prefer them fro social settings, actually they are everything drugs. I get super pumped off of oxy or heroin and I love to run miles and miles and talk to people or work. Withdrawals are hellacious for me though. Do yourself a favor and flush what you have less and just don‚Äôt think about oxy or opiates ever again. It‚Äôs shit down the road.

123^GodsBringerbitch^opium^Most opium is black tar, it could work I suppose. It‚Äôd take a lot of self discipline. Usually you would use something with a longer half life to break the habit. I‚Äôd suggest increasing the time between doses first. It‚Äôs next to impossible to taper H, because of batch consistency and what not. I‚Äôm sure someone has done it. I couldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve also learned that it‚Äôs somewhat similar to subs for me, that even if I have a measly 10mg of Vicodin or some weak opiate I can feel a difference and would be able to survive for 6 hours or so,  not gonna be happy but I‚Äôd be functional as if I had a hangover. with no help I‚Äôm barely coherent enough to do anything at all.

123^GodsBringerbitch^opioid^For me it‚Äôs the feeling of being barely awake, like I just woke up from a nap and there is a very felt sense of doom, but not depression, and it‚Äôs on repeat until withdrawal is at 5-6 days. That‚Äôs the worst for me. It‚Äôs the same for every opioid, just minor differences.

123^GodsBringerbitch^dreams^Just fed up with society and felt pretty homicidal in general. So I used it as a crutch to get over childhood trauma and frustration at having to put up with so much shit. Still fed up, but hopefully I can hole up and make my life comfortable without dope and successfully wage my culture/spiritual war in a few years. Dreams that‚Äôs all we are.

123^GodsBringerbitch^opiates^Same things I do when I‚Äôm on pills(heroin now) honestly. Play jazz music, draw fucked up horror scenes, box at the gym and go for runs or rock climbing,  astral project and say hello to the entities, also video games and work take my time when I don‚Äôt have the energy for those hobbies. I‚Äôm pretty consistent in that, other than scoring and being sick, opiates don‚Äôt change my interests or behavior much. WAAYY too much internet, it‚Äôs like another addiction in itself.

123^GodsBringerbitch^opiates^Yes, can‚Äôt really maintain during withdrawals. I passout and if I‚Äôm not passed out, I can‚Äôt talk to anyone, I sweat and the paranoia and hypochondria eats me alive,  Talking is a part of my living right now and  opioids get me wired like how people imagine cocaine being, I just have a ton of energy on them and when that goes away, I can only sleep. I dont get sleep issues with opiates, just narcolepsy.  I‚Äôm babbling, you are correct. Back to it on Monday for me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
124^runescapesex^black^Really, it makes the point of view the white nationalists hold seem more reasonable. The fucked up thing is, if a white person tweeted this shit and replaced the white with black, cancelled. But when a strong, independent woman like this says it, it's racist to even *call them out*. Shits fucked, man.

124^runescapesex^black^With it's illegality, the government makes it pretty hard to get heroin. And yet, people still do it, every day. Do you think the system is working now? Because it isn't. It's fucked. The reason people die from fentanyl now is the black market. The only way that will work is to legalize and build more rehabs, because we're going to need a lot more in the next few decades, whether there Is a change to drug laws or not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
125^TheRevvX^opiate^Unrelated, but I started off with a single Perc, researched, and realized how badly of a slippery slope I was going into. So glad I got out of the opiate game before I even had the opportunity to get in.

125^TheRevvX^black^I'm not sure about black tar, but one of my old buddies used to use his meth pipe to smoke China.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
126^throwaway_for_shite^dreams^I wouldn't doing more than a tab, maybe tab and a half just to ease your way back in. You'll trip harder alone as well.

Get a blanket/duvet, lie on your bed or the couch, and just drift away with some good music. Let your thoughts flow an insights might come to you. Ego death may come or it may not, either way you're bound to have a good time.

*Remember the long comedown*- I always seem to forget that once the main peak finishes, the trip is only half over. 

If you remember try a little Q&A with yourself post-peal. As yourself about your life, your dreams, what you enjoy doing. That can help you with insight too.

Whatever happens, safe tripping friend. Come back and tell us what you learn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
127^jhnlmn19th4pr1l^opiates^When people ask about stims most answers are pretty neutral, but with opiates, the "please no" army is always right around the corner, that s what scares me.
Not gonna try, Meth is addictive enough

127^jhnlmn19th4pr1l^black^Why black? Or do you mean that what comes after death is true nothingness? I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding you

Have you ever thought about the nature of nothingness? If there is nothing at all there are also no boundaries that could stop this nothingness from being everything at the same time. Absolute Infinity (or what people would refer to as God) seems like the same thing as nothingness to me.

What do you think?
Tip: since you are probably into psychedelics if you're on here, I suggest trying 5-meo-dmt (not regular DMT, specifically 5-meo) in a responsible setting/ceremony, in case the stuff I just said sounds like hogwash to you

127^jhnlmn19th4pr1l^dreams^Hmm, I only use meth once every 4-5 weeks, but that's enough to start having dreams about it.
I think if I tried both which I won't, I'd prefer meth because of the inherently sexual component.
Idk about you, but the comeup from meth feels exactly like right before sex, like straight up the exact same type of excitement that you can't get from anything else

127^jhnlmn19th4pr1l^opiates^> nothing is better than an oxy high

That's what I think I'd feel like about opiates if I tried them

It's similar to the feeling you get when you wake up to early and realize you have lots of time to snooze before getting up, isn't it? That's one of my favorite feelings for sure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
128^Hugsfordrugsuk^opiate^Hey. Yes I have! I recently posted in the opiate recovery thread. I‚Äôm now 3 days free of any opiates. 

What dose are you down to?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
129^HighRoller0190^opiates^Right, I was never really hooked on the regular opiates, I got hooked on Tramadol, and used lope to "get over the 3 day" withdrawals which I have gone through and they're not fun but not terrible from a month straight of 400mg+ daily of Tramadol. But holy hell, trying to quit a lope habit is another animal. It's so drawn out and you feel terrible, going from sweating to shivering, constipated to diarrhea, can't think straight and mood is going in every direction. I think that is a taste of what a hardcore heroin habit must feel like.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130^gatsby06^opiates^So I have been in fear of benzo WD this entire time, and it‚Äôs been 3 days since I had one and I don‚Äôt feel that at all. Given it was mainly valium and ambien, so maybe it‚Äôs on its way, but I am very surprised by the lack of issues from that so far. Just my experience. I have also considered going to a detox just in case lol so there‚Äôs some great conflicting info for you, sorry about that. If it‚Äôs xan, then don‚Äôt leave anything to chance. Detox, hospital, taper meticulously, switch to a longer acting bz, etc. I‚Äôm sure you are fully aware of these options. Don‚Äôt mean to sound like I‚Äôm wise. I have not been acting wise for a while. You‚Äôre clean of opiates though. Whatever about the subs. You are on a safe path.

130^gatsby06^opiates^I‚Äôve done the same. Thought it would be easier coming off opiates. I don‚Äôt know what the answer was, frankly. I‚Äôd strongly advise against doing that to anyone out there though. I‚Äôm tryna listen to some good ass music at the moment instead, for instance. Wish that could last numerous weeks...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
131^bubblegum-bittch^opiate^I guess you have a point. Not sure how I‚Äôd go about getting suboxone for those days, though? Maybe ask my doctor if he can prescribe me Suboxone or methadone for other days? I‚Äôm already on Oxycodone and a few people I know get a short acting and long acting opiate, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to get both right? I don‚Äôt wanna push it and risk getting cut off.

Thanks for the words of advice. I‚Äôll most likely listen because I don‚Äôt wanna end up addicted to H.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
132^daquanjongun^opioid^Tbh I‚Äôve never tried it bc I don‚Äôt fuck with opioids at all. Drank lean and it was amazing but knew I reached my peak with my first high. Opioids are the only drug that really scares me, I‚Äôd honestly do cocaine before I‚Äôd do another opioid

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
133^suttree3205^opiates^You fried your brain with MDMA. It can arguably be really good for you in extreme moderation but can damage your brain permanently like you're experiencing. I don't know if it'll ever go away but I doubt it. Please everyone reading this, read up on MDMA and if you're gonna use it, use extreme caution. This is an extremely dangerous substance and is not to be fucked with.

You can recover from opiates, benzos, alcohol, etc.... You fuck up with molly, you gotta deal with it for the rest of your life

133^suttree3205^dreams^I'm pretty strange. When I smoke, I have insanely vivid dreams. Apparently most don't even dream at all when smoking.... anyone else like this??

I see vivid, lush, huge landscapes at about 8k resolution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
134^soberfornow5^opiates^Yeah, i‚Äôm feeling pretty good, not drowsy anymore just slightly relaxed feeling but yeah definetly not taking anything more today, the first place i took the xanax and alcohol was because i wasn‚Äôt feeling basically anything from the tramadols because i just have this natural tolerance for opiates for some reason but for now i‚Äôm just gonna chill for couple of hours with my friends and go to bed, thanks for the reply!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
135^KushSmoka^opiates^My friends started doing opiates because they're out of weed LMAO their excuse was Reeee didn't smoke weed in long time and I need to get fucked up. People that were scared to try molly with me with safe harm reduction are now going into opiates straight away. I am out of weed too but I would never put that shit into my body just because I'm low-key addicted to weed

136^Nicksantana2332^opiates^whats your tolerance like? cause i‚Äôd wanna take at least 3 of those for 15mg or maybe even 4 but that‚Äôs already 975 apap and i get sick from 2 10s with 325 in them as well lol guess its just my tolerance to opiates

136^Nicksantana2332^opiates^i definitely do have an addictive personality even with substances i don‚Äôt really enjoy everyday 
, i still do them if i have nothing else to get high off, constantly glorify it in my head etc, opiates have just been my new DOC lately. i definitely know what its like to fight that inner addict and go against what u want to do even when you arent fully addicted such as yourself, wish u the best of luck! and i hope u beat this addiction you‚Äôre strong u got this

136^Nicksantana2332^opiates^i took around 80 my first time and felt warm, fuzzy, a bit more social than usual, and just overall comfortable and happy the effects weren‚Äôt really overwhelming just comforting and i felt itchy as well. not the best one to get high off in terms of strength but its definitely enjoyable if you havent taken any opiates in a while

137^dxmhippo^opiates^Opiates are incidious as fuck. Happy you've decided to get out. 
I wish you well üòå

137^dxmhippo^pox^For some reason the dildo dude reminds me of the cucumber from Veggie Tales but with chicken pox, a missing eye and he"s covered in blood.

137^dxmhippo^opiates^Dilaudid 8mgs I don't have much experience with other opiates to give you a comparison but they're strong and give an amazing Rush if you IV. 

They make me feel warm and fuzzy, like I can do whatever.  I'm happy and numb :)

137^dxmhippo^opiates^I'm doing okay. I eat when I'm hungry and shower every 2-3days. I'm unemployed atm so I don't go out much and live in a rural area so it's hard to find a way out of this town (even if I had my car). I feel very trapped atm. I can't see friends much because of it but we talk alot and they're so supportive. I'm endlessly thankful for them. But they don't do opiates so it's hard for them to get it alot of the time. So this subreddit and others related have been a godsend. 

You guys are cool to talk to and the memes are fucking great. 

That's about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
138^willsteves^opioid^It's so hard because of this bull "opioid crisis." I'm also 27, many doctors don't believe me. It's a hunt to find a good doc. I recommend seeing at least 2-3 specialists for conditions. Also make sure to get the official RA diagnosis, that'll help keep you from getting dropped.

I've had FAI and now have back problems and Degenerative disc disease. I'm 27. I go to college now, it's bloody hell and hard. I use a crutch to get around. They have a shuttle thank god, to get around campus.

If you're not doing anything, it definitely makes you look like a drug seeker. Not saying you are, but you absolutely need to find some way to make it look like you're a productive member of society. Maybe try  online classes, or some type of job where you can work from home. Either that or disability. Without disability, no job / school is a red flag.

I wish you the best of luck, it's not easy

138^willsteves^opioid^I've had a L5-S1 disc bulge with nerve root impingement for 5 years now. There's no way I can do yoga, I don't have much ROM. Inversion table helps somewhat, been using it for a few months. 1st epidural is scheduled for Thursday. I've been doing Physical therapy for 6 months. Just had an MRI and the bulge is still the same size. I tried chiropractic care, a whopping $600 / month from the top rated guy locally on yelp. No improvement.

I go to pain management, where science comes in the form of a pill to battle my pain for me. I am eternally grateful. Life would be very hard to live without this medicine. 

Now, I don't know of pain management criminals, or businesses really. I do know of some sympathetic doctors who  spend years in training, applying themselves deep into medical debt, giving their 20's, to care for pain patients. When there are several other lucrative specialty practices. And they're now overburdened by this fake "opioid crisis," where ignorant ppl say all doctors who are prescribing opioids are criminals, and that this medicine is an illicit drug. Easily accessible research via google can show that most opioid deaths are the result of illegally tampered opioids with Fentanyl from China or Mexico, not pharmaceutical opioids. The truth is, opioids are the only pain medications that scientifically act on the actual pain receptors themselves, on a chemical level.

So you actually should probably not go to pain management. Because, these doctors  just want to get you hooked on opioids, which have a smaller addiction rate than alcohol. Pain is just pain, and all pain patients should suffer. So, when your bulge undeniably gets worse like mine has, and looks to be permanent now, you would be a full on sociopathic drug seeker to even ask for pain medicine. So many patients are suffering from physical conditions that don't go away, but ofcourse we should all suffer, because an opioid is an illicit drug, and drugs are bad m'kayy. It doesn't matter that science has medicine that can relieve pain, you should forever stick to Tylenol, even though Tylenol doesn't even come close to chemically relieving pain as opioids on a chemical level. And you should be thrown in jail if you ask for pain meds, or if a doctor prescribes medicine for pain, then jail is a must. They're just trying to get pain patients hooked, even though these opioids can very well safely be tapered over 1-2 months. All pain patients should suffer, and all pain doctors should be locked up for having the ludicrous idea to use science to relieve pain. Am I right or am I right??

138^willsteves^opiates^My dad and brother have recovered from substance abuse problems. I have another brother who's addicted to narcotics.

&#x200B;

I've been prescribed opiates for surgeries on and off since 2014.  I could of asked for refills several times, but didn't. I recently started pain management a year ago bc the pain got much worse. It seems that you're aware of it all, so you should be good. If you research opioid addiction rates, they're similar to alcohol. So it's not like you'll forsure get addicted. Just monitor and be honest with yourself and you should be totally fine, like many responsible chronic pain patients out there.

138^willsteves^opiates^That's why we should vote Andrew Yang in, he intends to legalize opiates like in Europe. Once it's legal, ppl will be more accepting of it. Although there's still plenty of ppl who won't, legalization will things easier

138^willsteves^opiates^The problem is I don't know anyone else who's into opiates. He knows he's the only  way in the opiates crowd. I have no fucking clue who else to ask. This dude was with the only H crowd in high school. There's not too many ppl who I can ask.

I've known this dude. Heavy nods, way slurred speech like long and dragged out when you're on H, constant stomach problems can't eat spicy foods.

Yes, I'm fucking entitled because I'm FUCKING DISABLED AT AGE 27!!!  And I'm a close friend. I believe that makes me entitled in this particular situation. I'm going to be in a goddam wheel chair soon. I can barely walk, it's so obvious the motherfucking pain I go through. And a close friend can't even help me out?! Does H completely drain your soul? He can ask his dealer, or plenty other ppl who does H. He literally said sorry nope, didn't even try. He knows plenty of ppl who may know someone.  He can be like I'll ask around. Betch your ass I'm entitled god motherfucking dammit

138^willsteves^opiates^Nah man, through all we've been through in life. I'm literally going to be in a wheelchair within the next decade. We used to be best friends man. And I do still see him time to time. When he went to opiates, we didn't hang out as much.

I have the hips and back of a goddam 70 year old. Literally limping throughout all my 20's. Like I have a serious goddam condition, and this guy doesn't even try. Not at all. It 'd be one thing if we were just acquaintenances, but we've known each other most of our lives, being best friends at one point.

He's not obliged, but he can at least try to tell me to hit up someone we may know.

138^willsteves^opioid^Socal, opioid pain pills works on pain receptors.

Seriously though, I've been limping literally all throughout my 20's, and he tells me to just deal with the pain. You and I know he has some hooks. Bitch ass punk needs what he deserves. Lol

138^willsteves^opioid^They're pieces of sh** that's why they asked.
I'm going to switch, I wonder if there's a wait when filling a first opioid script at a new pharmacy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
139^ubercharlesinit^opiate^Xans won't help a fuck ton. But for RLS it can definitely help a little, and it can possibly help you get some sleep. In my opinion it's worth a shot if the WDs are unbearable. Just don't get dependant on xans while your trying to get better. You do not want to end up with an opiate and benzo addiction, I cannot stress that enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
140^CYPROXY^gum^What I've always done and it helps probably 70% of the time is dip. Smokeless tobacco. It's a vaso-constrictor like garlic (which works too) so putting a huge dip right on the gumline in front of the tooth stings like hell for a bit but reduces the swelling like hell and so, makes the pain bearable.

I put it on and leave it on. An hour later or more I'll replace it. I'm a nicotine addict so I have a good tolerance for it. If you don't have a tolerance then it, like most poisons, will probably just make you sick but yeah, I still have a can in the car somewhere from the last time I had a tooth that made me want to murder people in the moonlight. ;)

Edit: Garlic works too. Chopped up finely and put on the gum but it's harder to maintain as it gets everywhere and it burns worse than dip. It does reduce swelling though. It's all about reducing swelling. Ibuprofen is a MUST. Combined with tobacco or something like it, should have the pain manageable within a day or so.

141^FreeIfUboofIT^dreams^Welp i saw this and YOLO'ed. spent over 2.5 grand. Computer of my dreams will be her on monday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
142^Big_Puma^opiates^I definitely identify with this; up until the age of 25 and before my proper diagnosis, I had went completely sober after on/off drinking and smoking since the age of 12. I had an incident at a concert, getting wild in the mosh pit when I was tripped and as I went to catch my weight, I broke one of my smaller thumb bones. After seeing the doctor the following day, I was prescribed Percocet...and life has never been the same since. I‚Äôve also messed around with blow and amphetamines but nothing makes me feel like opiates do. They make all my stress, anxiety, doubt, everything melt away as I slowly drift down a warm, imaginary river. Fortunately, I‚Äôm now a year sober from opiates but I do cheat a little bit with my moderate consumption of Kratom tea at the local Kava bar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
143^guccibaby913^opiates^Ugh. I pretty much hate all basic human functions that I now have to experience again. Physical pain, emotional pain,  shitting, having periods, being hot, being freezing, being tired... the list is never ending. It‚Äôs like opiates made me a robot, and I much prefer having the body of a robot to that of a human.

143^guccibaby913^black^Aw thanks for looking out. Definitely crazy to find another female in that situation in a piercing sub of all places lol.

 I‚Äôve only been off of black and on subs since January 22. Started off at 16mg a day and now I‚Äôm already on just 6mg daily. I definitely never wanted to be on subs longer than necessary, but I really don‚Äôt want/know how to deal with the H cravings once I get off of them.

I‚Äôve got a script for clonidine right now and I‚Äôm going to ask for a refill because it‚Äôs really helps when anxiety gets too bad.

143^guccibaby913^opiates^Agreed. Low doses give me energy and more patience for aggravation, family get togethers, etc. I‚Äôm really quick to anger and severe anxiety when I‚Äôm sober, so heroin fixes all of that. 

Luckily, I got into opiates heavily at the perfect time in my life. I‚Äôd started to become a depressed, angry drunk for some reason, but still reached for a bottle every time I had a good mood, bad mood, bored, etc. pretty much any emotion lol.

Really, you‚Äôd switch back to alcohol? Are you an everyday heroin user and it‚Äôs becoming unmanageable or?

143^guccibaby913^opiates^Same dude same. I was full blown into alcoholism, drunk everyday after work, every time I was stressed, barely getting hangovers anymore, catching a buzz on lunch breaks during bad days. Opiates removed the need or want to get drunk for me and became by favorite drug. I still have about one beer everyday but I almost never get drunk.

143^guccibaby913^opiates^Adderall overpowers opiates for me. The warm glow I get from opiates is overtaken by rapid heartbeat and need to stay busy. I prefer them separate or to take opiates on the stimulant comedown.

143^guccibaby913^black^So, the strip I have says not to cut it. Is that just an abuse preventative or does it screw with the efficacy to cut it?

Also, my black tar tests positive for fent. I last smoked at 4pm today. When am I safe to dose subs without risking precipated withdrawals?

143^guccibaby913^black^Yeah, I have a black one that I ordered like right when they came out. Now, I‚Äôm shopping for my second one as a backup, but haven‚Äôt ordered yet because I can‚Äôt decide on color lol

143^guccibaby913^opiates^Yeah, I‚Äôm also married (two years now) and luckily my husband is an alcoholic and a heroin addict as well. So, we both always get what the other one is going through. I definitely enjoy social interaction on opiates soo much more than on anything else and before it was opiates I was always drinking during any social situation. Funny you mention mdma because I actually hate that drug lol.

I miss the days when alcohol made everything better instead of now it feels like when I get drunk it makes everything worse and I start fights with my husband and make horrible potential arrest decisions. 

We jumped into heroin from morphine and oxy hard two months ago and have used everyday since. We‚Äôre about to try to kick the physical addiction this week with subs so that we can use only a couple times a week instead of every day. It‚Äôs just not financially sustainable with us both using all day every day. Fingers crossed that it works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
144^wolfmans_cousin^opiates^That‚Äôs a bummer lol. I‚Äôm not in full blown excruciating withdrawals but I‚Äôm definitely uncomfortable. Really mind blowing since it‚Äôs been literally 3 years since I‚Äôve had any opiates whatsoever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
145^HookItUpCuuz^chocolate^You‚Äôre a lucky man if 30mg does anything to you at all. I‚Äôm currently consuming about 600mg-1g once a week, although I‚Äôve cut down on my regular usage to about 300mg a day. I was using about 300-450mg once again up to 600mg+ pretty often although I have a huge tolerance and never really got noticeable effects from it. I don‚Äôt understand why I still consume it if it doesn‚Äôt really do anything for me. 

On the other hand I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about consuming smaller amounts of chocolate as a delicacy as your mind would probably play the placebo affect on you before you actually received significant amounts of any chemical to give you psychoactive effects, at least with how it seems you‚Äôre thought process is and how worried you seem, I bet you it will be more placebo than anything.

145^HookItUpCuuz^chocolate^I highly doubt chocolate has enough caffeine to trigger psychoactive effects in somebody who has been addicted for 25 years. I‚Äôd guessimate it‚Äôs about 5-30mg max. You‚Äôd have to consume large amounts of chocolate to get any noticeable amount of stimulants from it.

145^HookItUpCuuz^dreams^Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôve read some absolute nonsense on this subreddit before, but what you just said is sometimes what I think about not including infinite other theories i thought about, but I also think that‚Äôs part of the key is realizing that potentially all these infinite possibilities exist for yourself and your own universe but you have to master your ego for it to come true.

But it doesn‚Äôt play out the way you think it will, you have to truly and ultimately chase your deepest fantasy although it plays out oddly. I think I understand why most single objects in the universe are spherical based upon gravity like planets and stars for example is because no matter what way it‚Äôs observed there‚Äôs always a point directly on the other side of the sphere to the first point, but inside the sphere, there is infinite degrees of direction you can travel to reach the second point. This to me simply implies that life itself as you live it has infinite degrees of direction and birth is the first point and death is the second point, both points are like a negative, a opposite and have a some kind of five dimensional geometrical graphing of some sort to pinpoint wherever around the outside of the sphere. Mastering the ego completely which most humans are not consciously aware of, is where you can achieve full movement inside your own universe although you can‚Äôt break scientific law and you can‚Äôt ever seem to escape the moment eventually. Feeling like that makes time come to a halt as you reevaluate everything that ever was, is, and will be, a infinite times over. You just can never seem to find the final key that unlocks the longest path to the second point, you MIGHT even have the option to never reach it if you don‚Äôt want to, which would mean achieving some kind of immortality but I believe that would trigger something inside the sphere or just simply wouldn‚Äôt be allowed by whatever law governs it that is yet to be discovered. This also implies, because everything relatively is spherical in shape the bigger and smaller we get, that the universe is a never ending sphere of some sorts I feel like. 

If everything is a never ending sphere, it just means everything is reused and recycled into another form all throughout time, this meaning our pure consciousness as well. But once you are fully conscious and have mastered your ego, you will realize there is no point because you are the point this whole time, ONLY to forget why you became the point. You exist at this point until you realize that everything is indeed infinite and while you will never find the last key as those are infinite too, there are infinite paths to take, only bound to the scientific laws we‚Äôre aware of, also bound by things we are unaware of, which I think birth, death, and potentially DMT shows us, all dreams and fantasies of which are theoretically possible if a malicious group doesn‚Äôt kill you off once you gather too many keys, kind of like a real life RPG with bosses and shit but where your stats are like ego, luck, etc. DMT gives you the answer to who what where when how about yourself, but you will never figure out the why, which is infinity. Now because everything inside the sphere can be mapped not only three dimensionally, but fourth dimensionally by time, the outside of the sphere, that brief glimpse of our conscience reaching that point of finally getting a peak of what‚Äôs on the otherside, that very brief moment between death and your new life, you realize you are the sphere, only to have your conscience recycled into another living being, because remember we live and die continuously inside this sphere, therefore we are aware of the dimension of time as well as volume, width, and height, or 3 dimensional space. It gives rise to a notion that we ARE governed by a creator of some sorts, which exists multiple dimensions above what we can perceive as humans and is effectively what we call infinity. 

The real twist in this is that once you realize that you are the sphere, you realize that any dream you could possibly want could come true, but so can your nightmares. I‚Äôm a firm believer in mastering the ego, which in theory should allow you to walk your path desired as long as you obey the rules. Predictable situations still have predictable outcomes, you can‚Äôt play God or try to by any number of infinite ways, God has the first key, the last key, and all the keys in between as he placed them there for you on your quest, but remember there are infinite keys. So while you can keep collecting keys, you will never find the last one, or the why. Infinity is nothing but a infinite ladder of up or down as we choose to climb or descend. You can go as fast as you‚Äôd like in either direction, and I believe DMT to have shown me that.

I believe DMT creates such a certain chemical ripple in our brains that turns off or blocks out all sensory information from the five senses if you take a high enough dose to achieve a breakthrough experience, doing so causing us to rely on our only perception of existence left, our absolute raw conscience, the point that self realizes it‚Äôs the entire sphere. Complete loss of ego. 

Eventually most realize we will never have the answers to that which has been purposely placed out of reach, but just remember after all my rambling nonsense, when you are shown the doors after collecting enough keys, the right thing to do is still knock first, afterall it was never your sphere to begin with.

145^HookItUpCuuz^chocolate^Well one Hersheys Dark Chocolate bar has about 25mg of caffeine in it, so I suppose it just depends on the type of chocolate more specifically. I would do your research on the caffeine and other stimulant content and potentially consume chocolate with minimal contents of stimulants. 

My best bet... if the negative side effects of caffeine consumption even in low amounts that you experience are enticing you to correct them with a benzo, I would just avoid caffeine at all costs then. That seems the most logical step. Again, you try to figure out how to avoid effects of caffeine through enzyme inhibition, but that seems like a challenging task, but best of luck!

146^NodZilla69^opiate^Ive been an IV fentanyl user for 4 years. Here in Rhode Island Fentanyl completely replaced heroin a year before i started opiates so its all ive known instead of the usual person who does heroin. If you have no opiate tolerance then basically its a nice rush that goes up your spine and neck. Then its really deep nods. You could spend an hour in one spot and think it was only a minute. With no tolerance its honestly like periodic anesthesia and narcolepsy. If you have a tolerance then its just like a quicker version of heroin. Like if you compressed a heroin high from 8 hours into 2

147^Quick_silv3r^opiate^Thx for actually answering! It did get me itchy and had that bitter opiate taste which made me think its definitely at least some kind of opiate. Might not be fent and possibly some kind of weird analogue? Or the pills are just underdosed? Idk

147^Quick_silv3r^opiates^I havent done actual pharma opiates in so long i dont remember the exact taste but i do remember oxy, hydrocodone, and codeine all tasting bitter. Its been abt 3 hours since i dosed and the itchiness is gone so i guess its worn off. Thx again for ur help, im gonna wait another couple hours and then see if snorting will actually give me a buzz. Def gonna start small too since i know shit hits FAST when u rail it

Should I wait at least two hours if I do decide to redose?

159^dori_88^black^It's scary how these things happen. This past week at work I had a faux pas occur. I heard a word that I thought was "Heroin" it was a coworker that I know well saying the word "heroin," in reference to an unidentified individual. 

The next morning early, when she came in, before the rest of the office was in I pulled her aside and was all like, "is someone here on heroin?" & She was all confused. Turns out the word was "her own" in reference to a coworker who happened to be gossiping about them.

So, then I had to explain why I was so adamant about knowing who. I said, "*Hypothetically, IDGAF about what they do. I would never report it to a supervisor. However, I'd like to know to keep a watchful eye, because ever since my brother died 10 years ago I've carried Narcan. The antidote to an overdose.*" 

She thought it was the coolest thing ever. I didn't mention my own addiction, because I'm not trying to get fired, but I firmly believe Narcan needs to be accessible, free or very cheap, and people need to recognize the importance of harm reduction. 

I could go on about harm reduction because if you give an addict a second chance, there is a huge possibility they'll do great things once they heal. Plus human lives are important. Crazy, homeless, junkie, white, black, brown, & simpson yellow, we are all people.

161^stalkmyusername^opiates^Peep was obviously mixing opiates with benzos... Ppl think he died because of the last video of him dropping some bars in his mouth but the dude was already clearly high as fuck from something else. I don't know.

At the same time, I really know some plugs who can mix flualprazolam with Chinese fent (just a little to get ppl super addicted). People in this sub says this is IMPOSSIBLE because fentanyl is way more expensive than alprazolam or flualprazolam, but that's bullshit. If you are buying bulk from China you won't feel the difference.

My only advice is to stay away from presses made in UK, they are definitely pressed with dirt, other drugs, and even flour.

161^stalkmyusername^china^Yeah I wouldn't call living in Brazil is like being in a war zone, except if you are poor and live in Rio de Janeiro city.

The rest is pretty safe nowadays. But I see your point.

My point is, sometimes people just wanna work for someone and have a "simple" life you know. But maybe when you can't find that it's a sign to use your creativity. AliExpress came because of that. The owner was rejected even on KFC on China.

161^stalkmyusername^black^I would suggest to not generalize it... Imagine if they said that about black people and Africa? Not cool my dude.

161^stalkmyusername^black^Nigerian gangs fucked up for black ppl in Barcelona.

I lived there for a time, and after the mass immigration the population became noticeble more racist towards blacks... Before that the "focus" were on pakistans, but they were, in most cases, hard working people. The nigerian gangs on the other hand used to steal and assault everyone at late night in the beaches. 

I was "cool" with them because I'm latino from Latin America (Brazil), and I'm not 100% white lets say.

161^stalkmyusername^china^So naive...

Ppl think the price of fentanyl is what they see in their country but forgets how China produces that shit in bulk really cheap.

Stop spreading misinformation, a lot of people died taking bars and the autopsy made it clear there was fentanyl in their blood.

EDIT: Downvote how much you want, but maybe you will remember this comment when you are choking. Stop taking pressed pills with dirt, ants, other benzos and opioids.

162^mcsmackington^opiate^Get off your high horse, bud.  A lot of addicts are using because they hate their life.  They want the danger and risk that comes with it.  Others are using for pain relief that they can't get from their doctor anymore because of how bad opiate addiction has gotten.  Just because you don't understand a situation doesn't mean it's wrong.

Edit: and honestly bro, I know I have a lot to work on, but so do you.  Every single Post You've made has been on unpopular opinion bashing a class of people that you dont personally identify with.  You sound like a really self centered kinda dude.  And while I have a problem with drugs, I know I respect my fellow man.

162^mcsmackington^china^From what I've heard, there is a lot of speculation that China is drastically underreporting the severity of the sickness.

163^slusho55^black^I mean, he did say MLK was murdered because he was fighting for economic justice, and explicitly said it wasn‚Äôt for civil rights this past October (with Killer Mike too, a black man).

163^slusho55^black^This is what I‚Äôve been saying. Obama faced similar obstacles. What always amazes me is my very old (now dead) uncle was super super liberal. Like always voted for the left, but he wouldn‚Äôt vote Obama because he was black. You leave the race thing out and he‚Äôd look like he was a super educated old man.

The thing is, and maybe I just notice this because I‚Äôm a white gay man, I see a lot more people who I have what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúweak homophobia,‚Äù where they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm fine with it as long as they‚Äôre not waving it in my faces (read: as long as they don‚Äôt fall into any stereotypes and the only way I‚Äôd know is because of who they‚Äôre dating). Still awful, but politically, that bodes well for Pete because that means I think he could get some homophobes‚Äô votes. Hell, he almost got this one

163^slusho55^toys^That disc was the shit! I remember the day preorders started, I had my mom rush me to the toys r us 45 minutes to preorder. I got that disc, and got Jirachi the moment I got home. I was so excited to finally have an event pokemon.

163^slusho55^china^I read a comment that explained well why this would actually be a bad idea:

If we shut out travel to and from China, people would just fly somewhere else and enter or leave. This happens with some banned countries. I think people used to do that with Cuba, fly out of the U.S., then fly to Cuba. North Korea gives tours that visitors can (read:must) take when visiting. There‚Äôs no flights from the U.S. to North Korea, but they get American tourists from people here flying to another country, then flying to North Korea (I think their tourism site even explains how to do this). People would still enter China and leave to come to the U.S. Banning flights would just make it harder to track who all might have been exposed, so it‚Äôs better to just let it happen to keep better track and not have to check multiple flights.

The only way this could work is if the entire world agreed. Every country would have to agree to ban travel in and out of China, and China would have to agree too. I‚Äôm sure China‚Äôs borders are well guarded, but that‚Äôs why they have to agree, to protect that. We‚Äôd effectively have globally agree to quarantine the whole of China. China is pretty self-sufficient, but they do rely on some imports. We‚Äôd also have to band together to send supplies there (which would require some entry, but very controlled entry).

That‚Äôs not even to mention what would happen if you just quarantined 1 billion+ people. What would happen? Would China be able to run close to normal? Would their be a mass panic? What would happen to all the tourists/non-citizens there currently? How does Hong Kong function in this (which I could right a whole post about how they could leverage this)? Or Taiwan? Would the whole country be under martial law? What with the military do to people trying to escape? Will they cut the internet off completely, limit information both inside and out?

TL;DR: Cutting off international travel just to the U.S. would just make things harder. The only way to make such a tactic work is if the world effectively quarantined China, which would have a lot of problems.

163^slusho55^china^Only thing I can think of is quarantine anyone who‚Äôs come into contact with someone who‚Äôs come into contact with someone who is infected. The problem is, that‚Äôs a lot of people, that alone would be hard. Not to mention, you quarantine that many people, it‚Äôd be impossible to effectively limit airflow between all those people in this short of time. So, you get someone who isn‚Äôt infected, they‚Äôre not showing symptoms after 2 weeks, however, they‚Äôre stuck in this building with 200 other people for 2 weeks, and one of them is sick. You let the uninfected go, well, because they were in such proximity of someone who was infected for 2 whole weeks, they‚Äôre much more likely to be infected now. 2 weeks later, they show symptoms, and now they‚Äôre going to infect even more people because they were quarantined earlier.

What China is actually saying is closing off cities like they did is the only effective way to limit the spread, which we can‚Äôt do. So, China‚Äôs doing one of two things here:

1. (Best case scenario) Flexing to show that their plan is the best. This could be either to defend quarantining the cities, or it could just be them doing their usual, ‚ÄúHey guys, we‚Äôre the best and want you to know we‚Äôre the best.‚Äù

2. (Worst case scenario) They truly believe the only way to do it is to quarantine cities that are infected, and are trying to warn us so we can do it earlier than they did.

Either way, we can‚Äôt really quarantine a city here. It hurts China when they do, but it‚Äôs a different government and culture.

164^Wake_n_bake_Jake^opiates^Imagine getting prescribed opiates and giving them away lmao. If I got 10 hydros they‚Äôd be gone by the next morning. 

My dad actually didn‚Äôt enjoy the high from them at all. He could‚Äôve potentially been prescribed massive amounts of opiates for years because of his condition (really fucked up back, multiple surgeries), but he chooses to just take kratom or CBD and deal with the pain. 

The shitty thing is once he gave me that bottle he never gave me any again because my mom reminded him I‚Äôm a fucking junky lol.

164^Wake_n_bake_Jake^opiates^Dude, you tryna die? Mixing any benzos and opiates is asking for death. Especially H and clam. You‚Äôre gonna die if you keep this up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
165^FrozenClorox^toys^We have had a few discussions like this and we have tried a multitude of different sex positions, she has tried giving me forms of oral sex (which was nice but won't make me finish). We haven't tried toys however so maybe that is our next step

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
166^muchachaganj^opioid^Not to be weird but I saw you comment in another post that opioid tolerance can be irreversible? What do you mean by that

166^muchachaganj^opioid^Well I‚Äôm currently prescribed oxy which is an opioid as well. It‚Äôs great for my pain but is likely the cause of my worsening digestive issues. I‚Äôd like to try zanaflex, but flexeril doesn‚Äôt work at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
167^brunoguedd^dreams^I was so sleepy I answered not what I meant to say.
Didn't take the promethazine but still slept; kinda fun though, had some  vivid dreams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
168^5-Psycho-Naut^opiates^Yes sir pain-o-soma. I do wanna do 1500mg but as long as it‚Äôs not any close to overdose levels. I have a  tolerance to drugs naturally besides psychedelics & weed. I mean I see people taking 3-6 grams of this stuff and mixing it with benzos and opiates and not dying so I feel like it‚Äôs most likely fine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
169^ghostsandvodka_^china^bro literally all if u use someone on the street. theres no one with china that doesnt have fent in it

170^davidpastaroni^gum^Pulling out a bag of coke at a party quickly becomes pulling out a pack of gum in school. Even the teachers like ‚Äúlemme get a piece‚Äù

170^davidpastaroni^opiates^Blues MF, Roxicodones (if I spelled or said it right anyway) pharma shits I ain‚Äôt fuckin with no presses 

I don‚Äôt typically do opiates. Tied with benzos to me, just terrible drugs overall (IMO, I do fuck with kratom hard though). 

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm super high and nodding and shit, that‚Äôs the part of opiates I hate but my self control doesn‚Äôt abstain from. A quarter would definitely get my nuts itchin and I love a good pinch and twist

170^davidpastaroni^opiates^Ssri‚Äôs are known to make a limp dick. I‚Äôd try to get off them unless you really need them..

Personally, never tried a drug that makes me a god in bed. Better sober. You could always go viagra or cialis.

Uppers (meth, coke etc)make it hard to get hard

Downers (opiates and booze particularly) make it hard to stay hard but when it‚Äôs hard it‚Äôs hard. 

I‚Äôve had good sex on psychedelics but I‚Äôm always too distracted for it to be a thing I want to do. 

Sex is boring anyway, drugs are better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
171^uplight99122^black^Yes, I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Xanax doesn‚Äôt make you feel ‚Äòhigh‚Äô so that‚Äôs why you felt nothing. It isn‚Äôt that type of drug, it‚Äôs prescribed for anxiety so at most you will notice you‚Äôre more confident and have more of a don‚Äôt give a fuck attitude. This is why it‚Äôs such a dangerous drug. People are expecting to feel a huge sense of euphoria but when they feel nothing, the take more an eventually black out. 1mg is MORE than enough for 1st time. Hell, even people who take it daily would say 4mg is a big amount.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
172^do_crack_pussy^opium^Alright bet. And what you mean by vape it on top of weed? Like just hit the bowl normally with the opium on top?

172^do_crack_pussy^china^Lol fair assumption let's say I'm in China, and alright yea I'm on windows 10, is the activation key enough to recover?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
173^kdmcr^opiate^I think it‚Äôs because certain strains can give an opiate like effect, but from what I‚Äôve read there‚Äôs a chemical in there that attaches to opioid receptors (so the strains with more of this chemical would give you more of an opiate effect )which is why I think so many people bring it up here because when you google it, it does say it‚Äôs similar to an opiate. I also think it depends on the question. I‚Äôm trying to quit opiates so I posted a question asking how many g of kratom would equal 30mg of oxy, which I don‚Äôt think r/kratom would be able to help with much. But I think just specifically kratom questions should be asked there. But just know when people recommend it they probably have good intentions. I personally don‚Äôt recommend it to people bc I don‚Äôt have a ton of experience with it I‚Äôve only tried it a handful of times to wave off withdrawal symptoms and I did find that it helped me with that at the very least (:

173^kdmcr^opiates^Yeah in my head it sounded like a good idea at first lol. Now I just miss opiates. I dislike benzo highs so I know I won‚Äôt abuse them. I just can‚Äôt afford oxy but I have one M30 left and I‚Äôm just gonna try and score some heroin because my oxy plugs uncle sells and he gives it to him really cheap and he tests all his stuff (or so I‚Äôm told, still can‚Äôt be 100% sure it‚Äôs tested)
I was just trying to avoid going down the heroin hole since I can‚Äôt afford oxy anymore by attempting to take benzos since I could get em prescribed easy, o well.

173^kdmcr^opiates^Yeah I think I might know a few people who sell xans I gotta start asking them bc I hate being confused on what I‚Äôm taking. He‚Äôs great for opiates, benzos, not so much. Thank you for your help love

173^kdmcr^opiate^If it helps you kinda picture my sensitivity I‚Äôm an avg sized female and 0.75 mg of Xanax gets me pretty high but I‚Äôve only done it like 4-5 times and I only took the diazepam 5mg once when I first picked up the prescription  and i didn‚Äôt feel high just took away my anxiety but I haven‚Äôt touched it since then which was a few days ago. I‚Äôm more of an opiate gal than a benzo gal I was just hoping to make my oxy last longer and I figured since I have the diazepam it‚Äôs worth atleast trying. But I do find that benzos make me sleepy, I did end up taking the diazepam ~35minutes ago and I still feel good I‚Äôm starting to feel a little drowsy but I don‚Äôt have to be at work for 2.5 hours so I‚Äôm hoping any drowsiness will wear off by then (plus since my job is fast paced once I get going it‚Äôs usually easy for me to combat any nodding or drowsiness)

173^kdmcr^opiates^Yeah! I actually used Xanax one time when I didn‚Äôt have enough money for oxy and felt great off of 0.75mg it was a refreshing change (but I guess my heart will always be with opiates as long as I can afford them but I‚Äôm lucky as an average sized female it doesn‚Äôt take me much to get the feeling I‚Äôm looking for and my tolerance hasn‚Äôt raised much so I‚Äôm lucky I can afford oxy for now) 
I just took some of the diazepam about 10 minutes ago so I‚Äôll update on how I feel (: hopefully it goes well then I‚Äôll be happy my psychiatrist prescribed me these lol I‚Äôve had the prescription for a few days and haven‚Äôt even touched it (it was given for anxiety) . and thank you again for your advice and sharing your experience.

173^kdmcr^opiates^I‚Äôm only really knowledgable on oxycodone because that‚Äôs what I use, but if you go to r/opiates and go to the menu section at the top, click that, and scroll down to where it says ‚Äúfactsheets‚Äù you can search any drug there not just opiates and it will give you doses for light, common, and strong effects. (So say you have no tolerance, start with the lightest dose and go from there), it Also shows the effects it will give you, and how long it will last, as well as the bioavailability of each ROA and how fast it should kick in.  It‚Äôs been super helpful for me for dosing especially when I first started taking oxy and I recommend it 100% for harm reduction. I‚Äôm not sure if suboxone is on there because I haven‚Äôt searched for it on there but it‚Äôs definitely worth looking in to whenever trying a new drug, it‚Äôs been my go to. They have pretty much everything on there so it should be there. Hope that helpsüíú

173^kdmcr^opiate^Right that‚Äôs why I thought there was something wrong with me lool. My first time taking xans was my moms prescription they‚Äôre the peach ones and I took 0.75 and felt GREAT so when I popped 3 of these it confused me because it felt just like when I took 0.75 of my moms and that was only my second time ever taking xans because I‚Äôm more of an opiate person.  I mean atleast my guy doesn‚Äôt lie and say they‚Äôre 2mg even if they are fakes atleast he says they‚Äôre 0.25üòÇ

173^kdmcr^opiates^I wish I had more I would‚Äôve sent a pic to u but I took them all already, but maybe I‚Äôll cop one pill tonight cause I‚Äôm gonna see him anyways for some opiates and send it to see what ya think.

174^Winter-Law^opiate^I love it, it‚Äôs the only opiate I take on a regular basis. Been taking it for years now on the daily and still get really good effects. What is your opiate of choice ?

174^Winter-Law^opiates^Ye it‚Äôs really annoying. I had a beautiful warm buzz  but I was sitting up in bed scratching my feet for like an hour non stop. Really is starting to put me off opiates. This is why I love kratom, I get the amazing warm floaty feeling without the crazy itching.

174^Winter-Law^opiate^I‚Äôve heard they don‚Äôt make a difference to opiate induced itching but don‚Äôt know if that is true. Do you think it helps?

174^Winter-Law^opiates^Do you think it itches more than other opiates though? I‚Äôve only done kratom codeine and tramadol so not much Exp.

174^Winter-Law^black^You‚Äôre absolutely Stunning, all I can say is dye your hair black. fair skin and black hair is my favourite look on a girl.

175^throwawaybcuzdrugz^opiates^When I was 15 my parents went to Italy for 3 weeks. My older brother was staying over to watch me, but he knew I‚Äôd be fine by myself, so he went to a friends up the street for the night. I got bored, and wanted to get high or drunk. I had already dabbled a good amount in the fine art of Mary Jane.

My parents locked up the booze cause they expected my brother to have a party or something. I went to my parents room to see if my parents had anything interesting like Benadryl, dxm or whatever would make me tired. Yep, I wanted to get tired and sleep. I was that bored. Opened a drawer, and found a plethora of pill bottles. Looked through em, mainly just antibiotics. But there were another 2 bottles.

One of those two bottles had 19 5/300 hydrocodone. The other 4 10 mg diazepam. I took 8 of the hydrocodone, and started googling if they were any good. I soon realized I had stuck gold. Snorted 4 of em, took 2. Heaven. Yea ik it was dumb to snort the hydros lmfao. But god damn I was so mind numbingly calm. I felt like my freshman crush had just hugged me.

I spent that night playing xbox and listening to peep till 7 am. I have no idea how I didn‚Äôt pass out. Knowing 15 year old me I probably had a few energy drinks. Tried beating off cause ya know, 15 year old home alone and high, why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt I? To no avail.

Other activities of that night consisted of a 45 minute hot shower, an entire season of bojack horseman, and FaceTimeing the girl I would literally move to fucking canada for if she didn‚Äôt feel guilty for cheating on her boyfriend with me and un adding me on snap:,) 

So yea, that‚Äôs the first time I tried opiates. High on hydros rn as I type this. I miss that fucking girl so much dude. I fucking miss her.

175^throwawaybcuzdrugz^opioid^ From the sound of it you probably have no tolerance. 1950 mg of acetaminophen is just about half of the max daily dose, so you‚Äôre good there. 30 would probably be a bit much for someone who‚Äôs opioid naive. If I were you I‚Äôd take 3-4 depending on your weight, and take the other 2 later in the night until you hit a good spot

175^throwawaybcuzdrugz^opiates^Well on it‚Äôs own, it‚Äôs pretty much just good for knocking yourself out. Makes you tired af. But it‚Äôs also good por potentiating opiates.

176^TuneInTurnUpTurnOut^opiate^I‚Äôm living in this sober house thts part of an IOP program.   They‚Äôre giving subs and vivitrol to everyone no matter what their DOC was.  Telling them vivitrol will block all drugs not just opioids.   This one chick is 100% a crackhead.  No other drugs, just crack.  They‚Äôve started her on 8mg Suboxone right off  rip.  Now she‚Äôs all fucked up, puking, nodding out.  She‚Äôs never experienced opiate withdrawal, and now she will at some point.  becuz doctors give em away like candy.

Edit: missing words

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
177^27272727272727272727^opiates^Thanks for your reply, I‚Äôve just put my family through so much hell lately by admitting I‚Äôve had a problem with opiates and then detoxing at home. 

I can barely function with my kids...

I just don‚Äôt know how to tell my wife ‚Äúhey you know how I‚Äôve had this horrible problem that I‚Äôve just gotten through? Yeah well I‚Äôve got another...‚Äù 

Fortunately I‚Äôve only started drinking 4 days ago..I see the writing on the wall, if I don‚Äôt stop now I will never stop.

Sorry for the verbal diarrhoea I just have been holding everything in..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
178^druggiethrowaway1290^opiates^I do about 4 grams of molly a month and in between molly I‚Äôll just take anything I can get my hands on. I never really do a lot of benzodiazepines or opiates it‚Äôs more like a once every 2 weeks thing (I‚Äôm really scared of every going thru withdrawals) But the molly is the main problem bc I spend all my time that I‚Äôm not on molly as just a zombie coasting thru life. I think I just did so much molly that I have serotonin syndrome but I was already depressed asf before that. Things that should make me happy I just see them and don‚Äôt react, things that make me sad or anxious just fuck me up so hard. I‚Äôm 16 now which I didn‚Äôt really want to say bc someone my age should be doing any of this. I‚Äôm practically a mute when I‚Äôm not on drugs and when I am on molly I can finally connect with people and be happy.

178^druggiethrowaway1290^opiates^The opiates aren‚Äôt really my main problem I don‚Äôt think tapering will do much. It‚Äôs more of the molly and xans. Other pills are like a last resort but when I‚Äôm on molly I can finally feel emotions and connect with the people I love.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
179^cokedoutboohbah^black^Shit dude, I'm sorry you had to go thru that, must be horrible. I'm currently on a 13 day binge on black tar heroin. I've been snorting and IVing and tomorrow I will quit cold turkey I hope it isn't as severe as my withdrawals from when I was using 3 weeks+. Wish me luck and I hope ur doing better

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
180^Coastline_Seppuku^opioid^I used to bash on this drug, but it's actually a decent antidepressant. If you have nothing else it's better at painkilling than anything otc and lasts 6-8 hours which is good for an opioid

180^Coastline_Seppuku^dreams^Ahah I've done that too, I kept waking up while I'd be crashing into things. Stand back up and be falling on the floor again. Next thing I know it's the morning and I somehow tucked myself into bed. I would call gaba's visuals just like a daydream too. I'd love to know how it's psychedelic... I've seen OEV on pregabalin but not CEV. Opposite of gaba. By OEV I mean seeing shit in the corner of my eyes and objects looking like something else, and colors in front of me. Not full on daydreams like CEV on gaba. I also felt like I was seeing other people's dreams

180^Coastline_Seppuku^opiates^There's no way you aren't feeling 40mg lol, this is fake or what you got is fake. First time I did oxy I did 40mg with no tolerance and I couldn't even see straight I was so fucked up. As a side note, having food in your stomach fucks opiates up big time. Pretty much most pills will hit a lot harder if you don't eat beforehand

180^Coastline_Seppuku^black^There is such thing as black magic in Hinduism, but it often requires animal sacrifice so I won't be spreading that around, except I will tell you Bhairava and the ten Mahavidyas are heavily associated with occultism

180^Coastline_Seppuku^opioid^The doctors still push it's non-addictive, but I don't see how that's possible for any opioid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
181^MattVibes^black^Hahaha tbf i am on such a budget that I will have to... I mean black market weed is probably always a bit moldy

181^MattVibes^black^But wouldn't black market weed always have some degree of mold in it... Like I've probably been smoking it all the time. I only checked cause I stumbled on a Herb article saying how bad mold was so I was like "Oh, I'll just shine my torch on it".

Literally that was my entire weed stash and I am a student with very little money, I used a vaporiser and that would have lasted something like a month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
182^Pinkgloomyelephant^black^I sure did bruh, I can't even walk right, always sloppy with my feet. My vision is so blurry I see stupid black entities. Music feels alive and really sets my mood on its account. Pretty strong ride but manageable and really enjoyable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
183^Lifelovingattitude^opioid^I'd say more that it is the efforts to come to orgasm, like foretaste of it (high dopamine). Later, upon release, "la petite mort", huge endorphin rush is released with the feeling of emptiness. Like the cycle ‚Äî high dopamine (triggers, foretaste of pleasure) -> endorphin release (ejaculation) -> high prolactin/low testosterone (so-called apathy, numbness after orgasm), repeat. So, technically all this addiction is a blend of stimulant (low motivation, apathy, etc) and opioid (troubles with sleep, for instance, resemble the opioid withdrawal) addictions. And I know what am I talking about, because I was in those addictions. And yeah, the title is correct entirely.

183^Lifelovingattitude^dreams^You know, apart from caffeine, there are lots of drugs that weakens REM cycle. Alcohol, other psychostimulants, for instance. I remember, when I used amphetamines I rarely had even dreams. With caffeine the same thing. Hypnotics also tend to help with going to sleep, though the quality of sleep still not the best. Also, problems with sleep can be additionally caused by lack of serotonin, because melatonin is made from serotonin. I assume caffeine is only a part of the problem, hypothetically. And it can mess with serotonin levels, also. You know, ideally it may seem that quitting all drugs can return person to feel normal. Caffeine can also maintain that "PSTD status quo", like overthinking and overliving the same cycles. We can even suppose, that OCD can be also caused by unending stress and lack of sleep. Some even state that OCD can be an issue, caused by lack of serotonin.

&#x200B;

I think, the other question is: what REM phase is needed for? I mean in the stance of PSTD, nightmares. Like solving that riddle in the form of dis-ease via REM sleep phase? My friend, who works in psychotherapy, once said that his colleagues and teachers saw how people (patients) overcame their issues just with sleep. And you know, what's interesting? That today's world work almost without any sleep, 24/7. Is it some kind of coincidence, rhetorically speaking? Here also I remember Decartes' quote, about the pineal gland, that it is the seat of the soul. Pineal is linked to producing of melatonin. Like interesting chain is here: lack of sleep - low/lack of melatonin -  low serotonin - soul - pineal gland - PSTD/OCD - nightmares - caffeine - REM cycle. It can be that a person is drowned in his dis-ease purposefully. And you know, I sometimes struggle with anxiety and sometimes it detaches myself from what I have to do. This anxiety can inhibit growth, like continue some vicious cycle of doing the same things, experiencing the same emotional states, living again the same traumatic events, that were in the past and, logically, now don't serve any purpose at all. The past is no longer here, it was somewhere far away and it can't be changed. Like, being in the present, living the past cycles. I don't know, how to describe it other way. Though, the only way it can be checked ‚Äî is to try to live caffeine free. If ill effects go away, the riddle will be solved. That's why /decaf.

183^Lifelovingattitude^opioid^Haven't seen movie, so don't know. You know, from my experiences, I can assuredly say, that the best heroin use is on stimulants comedowns. It is even better than benzo (don't burn me, I'm not heretic, lol). Overdose is an intense feeling fucked up, like weak ties with reality, falling into unconscious. I once went with my mom to bank and I was extremely high on it. And she saw me "smashed" on the seat, waiting for her. She was horrified about seeing me "smashed". Though, heroin is the best physical high, apart from sex. From opioids, as for me, the most interesting is tramadol. I like it because of serotonergic activity. I once was too high on it and wanted to go to sleep, laid on the couch and found out like those dreams were extremely vivid, though I wasn't sleeping. Like to dream without dreaming. In retrospective, I can say that tramadol is the best opioid as for me, because it is unique in some sense. Don't know, maybe there are something new ones, that were invented. Speaking about psychedelics ‚Äî I think after all those binges on stimulants, opioids, even weed, psychedelics ‚Äî are the next logical step, like "maturiation" in some sense. Another level of pleasure and entertainment.

183^Lifelovingattitude^opioid^I think everything has its place. I assume, it can be possible. Substance or any other abuse is connected with some kind of a problem. In my stance, caffeine only enhanced my fears, though it made me possible to see them. I think it's a tricky line between what a person really needs and abuse. For instance, alcohol abuse can have some problem inside in the person, who drinks alcohol. I used to drink alcohol just for getting rid of tension in me and soothing me. And you know, I drank alcohol with people, that had nothing with me and I thought they were friends, though we only drank alcohol, like "brothers in distress". Sometimes substance abuse is a mask of some problem. Sometimes it is some kind of "easiness" of a problem, like in opioid addicts. About traumas I can say, that trauma has meaning in the lives of people. Without them there is no learning. Even birth of a baby is a traumatic event. Sometimes other people with even harsh traumas can make others feel bad. Though, understanding that others can suffer more, gives some temporal relief. I'm not speaking about developing Stockholm syndrome, no. As for me, even harsh events in life have some meaning, to learn something and, probably, share with others. I assume, also, overcoming some traumas and doing the other way with a person's children ‚Äî is a key to success. Like you've seen how children should not be treated, now you can show how it should be done with knowing how it doesn't work. I believe, people should do impossible things, because without impossibilities there would be no miracles.

183^Lifelovingattitude^opioid^Yeah, thanks for your reply, man! I just want to understand, what I've done wrong, that really isn't working to go further. With caffeine, yeah, like I'm coming to conclusion that there is no need in it. If caffeine the thing, that holds me back. And it is quite possible, because fight-or-flight response, which is a) prolonged b) body wants to maintain homeostasis, due to wish to get rid of anxiety (that's why relapse can be an option, because it is an opioid relief). So, probably the stress was a main factor, I assume. Though, it amazes me, how caffeine can intensify all the inner problems, fears, tendencies, etc, etc. You know, from some perspective, caffeine just shows the weak points of a person, especially fears. Though, I'm not entirely sure about the fact whether these problems already were in the person, or just it is some kind of a delusion, caused by caffeine.

183^Lifelovingattitude^black^You know, I've made kombucha, using coffee instead of black tea and it seems like it doesn't give me the same jitters, as a cup of coffee. I haven't digged too deep, but some sources state that during brewing of kombucha, caffeine content decreases. I'm not sure entirely, though.

183^Lifelovingattitude^opioid^I said in my other posts that porn and masturbation were just a coping mechanism with my stress, feeling lonely, traumas and some partial parents' neglect. Porn just was a temporary pill, that doesn't work anymore. Like an opioid medication, that couldn't give anymore pain relief.

I agree with all the things you've said, absolutely! Nofap is just a way of life with later creating new healthy habits in order to understand what am I, who am I, what I like, etc, etc. A "hero's journey" thing. That's why keeping diary and writing down everything a person feels, experiences, changes he/she can see ‚Äî is a step towards maturing. Nofap is like some kind of psychotherapy with some introspection. Like "you were in hell", now find your way through purgatory to Eden, metaphorically speaking.

Good luck you too!

187^LsdCrusaders^opiate^Its fentanyl. And you think you're above opiate user just because you take xanax? LOL Some of the worst "junkies" ive seen are bartards..

187^LsdCrusaders^opiates^Wow this post continues to show how ignorant you are almost everything you say makes zero sense. Get some help buddy you seem like your mind is out in outer space although you cant even see it might be the benzos idk. And to go through somebody else post history to use something against them in a completely unrelated comment is just sad and pitiful. It‚Äôs the go to scapegoat for someone whos fishing for anything make themselves feel better. LOL jesus the fact that you think your better than another human because you use abuse benzos instead of opiates.. shows what kind of human being you are

188^miauuu2019^black^this love has burned a big black hole in my heart and soul.  if you've been lied to, cheated, and mistreated for 10 years, you feel dishonestly much hatred.  I was never before someone who would intentionally inflict pain ... but with this person it is different ... I would tear his fucking heart out of his body

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
189^Im18DontBanMe^opiates^I smoked a lil tar before school once and felt like a million bucks.  Social anxiety eliminated,  good feelings coursing through my veins and I wasn‚Äôt sleeping in all my classes like usual.  But people kept asking me ‚Äúyou seem depressed are you okay?‚Äù or ‚Äúdamn you look tired you good?‚Äù.  I was so confused lol.  Then I ran the mile in PE, never tried that hard in my life.  Was sweating bullets, puked at the end, could‚Äôve sworn it was a 5 min mile at worst.  It was 12 minutes.  

Point is, sometimes you feel great on opiates but really to everyone else your just nodding and look fucked up.  Keep that in mind.

189^Im18DontBanMe^opiates^Weed withdrawal isn‚Äôt physical, but i‚Äôd say the mental dependency is on par with opiates and benzos.  It enhances everything, makes everything funnier, makes food better, makes you happier, makes sleep better, makes you focused etc.  When life isn‚Äôt enhanced anymore everything is just dull and bleak.  Nothing is funny, food tastes like shit, you feel like shit, you don‚Äôt sleep, you can‚Äôt focus etc.

190^A_cooops^china^This is the case for a lot of illnesses...

There‚Äôs no need to panic, it‚Äôs just like any other flu. I keep reminding myself it‚Äôs not as bad as Ebola! And the gov is doing hard work to keep it isolated. My uncle lives in China and while he said it is really bad in Wuhan it isn‚Äôt spreading out too badly

190^A_cooops^black^But who do they keep safe? The cops are very violent to black and brown people, as well as homeless people on the subway. In December the mta announced they would be spending $250 million on new cops to save $200 million fair invasion!

191^dexamfetamin^opium^Traditionally a special type of pipe is used, the opium is sticked next to the hole and you hold it next to an oil lamp. You can also just smoke it on foil or with a meth pipe.

191^dexamfetamin^opiates^There is no objectively most destructive drug. It depends on so many factors, but people keep bringing it up again and again. For some it may be benzos, stims, opiates or maybe even psychs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
192^Runeshamangoon^black^Blacked out in a bar, woke up still fully clothed, with boots on, passed out on the floor of my appartment having vomited everywhere and the door of my appartment still wide open. Pretty sure at least one of my neighbors saw me.

I also almost killed myself by putting something in a pan (still not sure what it was) and passing out without turning it off. Woke up to heavy smoke and something reduced to black goop in my pan. Still unsure of what it was, had to throw out the pan because it wouldn't come out.This saturday I woke up sitting up in my bed with McDonald's strewn all over the bed, all lights on and music playing. Last memory is doing shots in some shitty club

  
Also, I'm currently feeling like absolute shite at the office because I was completely wasted from friday night to sunday morning non stop, snorted a gram of amphetamines, too twitchy to sleep and snorted a bigass line of pseudo-ketamine (2-fdck) and passed out tripping balls. Appartment is a warzone and I'm completely out of it hiding in my office with the shakes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
193^VDANSI^opiate^I remember my first experience clear as day. I was just a quiet JR in HS. A friend came up to me in class and told me to take a tylenol and I thought nothing of it, thought maybe he was just being random so I took it since I knew ZERO about drugs. He comes up to me at the end of class and asks if I feel anything and confused I said no so he gives me another 2 and I take them since one of his boys is now telling me that this tylenol will relax me. I went a whole other class and a half without feeling anything. I had already forgot about it at this point but then it all hits at once . I got warm and soooo happy it was unexplainable. My eyes felt so soothing, I had this smooth type of energy, and this strong confidence came over me. I was in english class and just wanted to read to the whole class because i felt so sharp. I had detention after school and it was the greatest hour of silence ive ever experienced. Everything in life just felt so right and made sense. I wasnt this awkward kid anymore and it lasted til I went to sleep. Hours of non stop euphoria and i couldnt stop talking. I was talking to strangers at the grocery store and on the street. It was the most perfect feeling in the world. It was vicodin that he gave me btw. I was sick throwing up for hours and hell it even felt great to throw up. 10 years later and im still dabbling with opiates, with 4 years of combined breaks in between of course, and have never had a serious problem because my fear of god and anxiety has always kept me from going over board. Ive tried every opiate provided by pharma except oxymorphone. Ive tried everything from tramadol to fentanyl patches once but surprisingly hydrocodone is still my DOC. I have never tried H and never plan to do so and I dont say that in a judgy way im just terrified from everything ive learned on r/opiates. So many details to this story but tried to keep it short.

193^VDANSI^opiate^So im assuming before you tried H your tolerance to opiates was through the roof already right? Was the first H high the same as the one from that first yellow in high school? I heard some where the only time you get that first high feeling is the the first time you try any opiate and the first time you try H.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
194^Weedhub0325^opiates^Just talk to the dr before hand and let them know you have experience with opiates you only need a low amount for the pain, it's not going to turn into dependance and see where that gets you. Goodluck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
195^MDMath^black^Ive called the cops on somebody who whas doing a psychosis on black molly, they couldnt arrest him because he was only high and didnt have shit on him


Yes i shouldve called an ambulance me and my friend felt really dump trapshotting this guy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
196^ThePercenator^opiates^kratom seems to be good for withdrawals based on what i‚Äôve heard from people who use/have used it. The only thing (and it is a big thing) is Kratom becomes addicting and dependent itself and when you get off kratom you‚Äôre going to have the same withdrawals you would‚Äôve had from Kratom dependency as you would from Opiates. Just because Kratom is legal doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs completely safe and not addicting and dependence forming

196^ThePercenator^opiates^that‚Äôs funny you say that because I just brought the dab rig back out today, forgot I had it stored away and as soon as I wake up tomorrow I‚Äôm gonna try to cop some wax and see if that‚Äôs any better for me nowadays than weed. God I hope so, i miss enjoying weed dearly. Honestly think if i still enjoyed weed I could get off of opiates no problem, but I won‚Äôt let myself drink on weekdays and I just need some way to not be sober and weed just isn‚Äôt an option anymore. Let‚Äôs hope some low doses of wax can get me right

196^ThePercenator^opiates^if you decide to DEFINITELY wait til those effects have worn off first. Fuck mixing benzos and opiates in my opinion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
197^cheap-nugget-holder^chocolate^Sorry man but it‚Äôs kind of hard to give u an answer while being that vague. Did you mean how long until you will run out or how long will the effects stay in your system

Either way it doesn‚Äôt really matter , all depends on the amount of weed in them and the kind of edible doesn‚Äôt really effect the weed. There is an exception to this rule which is brownies because chocolate potentiate weed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
198^tephtephy28^opiates^Probably. If there is actually opiates in it, especially if its fent, you should definitely feel it. Just do a small line and see how you feel and then go from there. You can always do more but you cant do less.

198^tephtephy28^black^I usually see a black dot float by. I'll think it's a bug flying or something but then I wont see it again.

198^tephtephy28^opiate^Honestly I would go with something else. That's asking to die if you are opiate naive, you dont want to choose the most potent one there is and not know how to dose for it. That's not the best place to start imo

198^tephtephy28^opiates^You very well could have an allergy to opiates. If that's the case, try taking benadryl when you use. Or if you cant get your hands on zofran. Or otc dramamine N to keep you from throwing up.

198^tephtephy28^opiates^Anything that increases your serotonin can cause it. Opiates, anti nausea meds, anti depressants. They all play a factor. It's happened to me several times when I'd take to much in a day

200^weeeeeeeea^opiates^yeah idk man serotonin syndrome feels like shit try not to mix dxm with anything else that ups serotonin (mdma, opiates, lsd) like it could be good but nowhere near worth the risks

200^weeeeeeeea^opiates^mdma, it‚Äôs like u sort of get hooked without realising but it‚Äôs not as bad if u give it a rest in between, coke, meth and heroin obv, opiates maybe, ketamine is a nicer light one that‚Äôs at least harder to get addicted to

201^Saftnase_com^china^>**Q:** **Am I at risk for novel coronavirus from a package or products shipping from China?**  
>  
>There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don‚Äôt know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the [2019 Novel Coronavirus website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html)¬†as it becomes available.

202^Cronic12^black^i made lean for a party out of a bottle of liquid hydrocodone my gran left behind when she moved, i brought the punch bowl to the party and almost everyone was either mexican or black, with a few white kids.

they thought i was mexican, too.

im arabic.

203^714Lana^opiate^It did not make me feel sick...just a hint of nausea for a second. I have quite a long drug history however haven't had an opiate habit in many years.
Yes 4mgs of Sub lasted a while and was also stronger than expected

204^whydoidothishit^gum^yeah i usually have gum and its still pretty bad i wonder how bad it would be if i didnt use gum :/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
205^RoastedArmadillo^black^K hole and you‚Äôll be over your fear of death. I ‚Äúdied‚Äù on ketamine. 

After a dislocation the hospital gave me IV Ketamine and immediately I was sent to an empty space. Everything was just black. It‚Äôs as if I knew the exact shape and size of this ‚Äúroom‚Äù that I was at. I had accepted that I was dead, I figured the hospital messed up my dose and killed me. After finally accepting that I was dead then I was shot through a tube just like in the intro to Futurama right into a hospital bed. When I realized that they weren‚Äôt harvesting my organs I finally felt safe. 

It wasn‚Äôt fun but I‚Äôd do it again if I could. It really made me appreciate and respect life.

205^RoastedArmadillo^opiates^Snort half at a time. With hydromorphone it is absorbed much more like that unlike most pills. You‚Äôll feel great and weed will only make you feel better. Trust me I remember my first time getting those. Been strongly addicted to opiates for going on 6 years.

205^RoastedArmadillo^opiates^I take 2mg about twice a day. It‚Äôs what keeps me going and when my body doesn‚Äôt get it, it just shuts down. A lot of people can‚Äôt sleep when detoxing but for me I can‚Äôt stay awake. Opiates are definitely now a big source of energy. Without them I can barely find it in me to move

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
206^FrankNSam^opiate^Agree 100%. My fave is when they ask for advice, you give them advice and they talk back or question the advice. Almost as bad is some of the responses.. ‚ÄúI have 2 80mg oxy pills and I‚Äôm opiate naive, should I take a whole one or cut it into quarters?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo man, grind em both into powder and rail that shit!! Then call your guy and buy three more!!‚Äù

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
207^TheBlues501^opiates^Hey! Firs off I want to let you know you for sure sound dependent, not addicted! Everyone‚Äôs body and brain eventually gets used to being on opiates and adjusts the chemicals it‚Äôs making to account for the influx, totally normal. You‚Äôre really feeling heavy withdrawal from 5 mg oxy? Damn I‚Äôm sorry. The taper does seem slight too quick impo. Anyway? DPH and antihistamines if it‚Äôs class are very well known to make restless leg much worse, so that might be why it‚Äôs been so bad. Like the other commenter suggested I recommend asking your doc for some comfort meds. I recommend clonidine and gabapentin. Take the clon during the day and the gaba at night to sleep. But be careful and don‚Äôt take the gaba for long or over use it as it had its own set of really nasty withdrawals which can be much worse than just opi withdrawals. And cut out the DPH! Hope this helps!

207^TheBlues501^opiates^I‚Äôve seen red hot before but I‚Äôve always wondered if this would just burn up the opiates? Like ya know how on foil the goal is to vaporize it not burn it ya know? So that‚Äôs super interesting that you just go in red hot. Lmaoooo super low temp H dabs for the delicious terps gahaha killed me eith that one

207^TheBlues501^opiate^Your best bet is to eat them. And that little of a dose is just enough for an opiate intolerant person to get high so honestly buddy they ain‚Äôt finna do jack shit for you. And if they have Tylenol and you IV them that shot if gonna do your body really bad

207^TheBlues501^opiate^Yeah man the nodding puts ya into a funky dream state that‚Äôs often described as psychedelic. That all that‚Äôs happening. Oh also. Hydromorphone is a very strong opiate but methadone is another beast. I would probably expect her to have a much stronger ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and therefore more of these side effects your talking about from methadone. Hydromorph has a terrible bioavailability something like 16% while methadone is close to 100%. So if she‚Äôs taking them both oral then I think the methadone is going to be much stronger. Mg for mg I believe diluadid is a bit stronger but methadone is a whole another beast and lasts 24 hours sometimes more while hydrmorph only lasts about 3. I assume that‚Äôs why there making the switch? I hate to ask but do they expect her to go into remission...?

208^imsome1wholikesstuff^opiates^Im still trying to figure out how to manage my anxiety without doing opiates or benzos.

208^imsome1wholikesstuff^opiate^I beg to differ, kratom gave me an opiate high when i had no tolorance but after being on fentadope i cant feel this shit anymore so i guess i agree but disagree at the same time

208^imsome1wholikesstuff^opiates^Yea instead of that for me im like completely isolated doing like opiates n benzos totally blacked out on xanax or flubromazolam n nodding on fent im going through both of those withdrawals rn and im the most anxious person ever

208^imsome1wholikesstuff^opiates^U have a chance at dying when mixing downers. Alcohols a messy drug and mixing it with GABAnergic drugs like (pregabalin n gabapentin) benzos opiates and barbiturates is very dangerous.

208^imsome1wholikesstuff^opiates^Yea its no suboxone and i do get annoyed when a person whos switched to kratom from opiates comes on here n starts preaching like its that easy to get off dope

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
209^ikoniic^opiates^I know right?! What are the fucking chances lol. I literally see him once a month.  Me and my boss are really close though so honestly I wouldn't have gotten fired or anything. He would have been more so mad that I didn't tell him. Then again, who tells their boss that?? He is a good boss though. If I did actually have a problem and needed help, I could trust him enough to ask him for help and know my job is safe. I just didn't want him to get any wrong ideas because opiates aren't really my thing. I'm good with juat herb. And thank you üëåüèº

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
210^RichMan_24^black^The democrat run inner cities seem to be doing well. What‚Äôs insulting is White liberals harassing black people who vote for Trump. Or black liberals calling Black Trump supporters ‚Äúsellouts‚Äù and ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äôs‚Äù. Funny how you fail to mention that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
211^gurraplurra^china^They are extremely densely populated in some cities and China has huge investments and I would guess buisness people over there too.

I think the heat might be why I heard someone say in this thread that heat prevents the spread, I have not confirmed this though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
212^Ddonitz^opiates^How do you dose 25 micrograms ? Volumetric ? The dose is oral ? Also I find a bit irresponsible advising to someone with no opiates tolerance carfentanyl.... finally 25 of carfentanyl would be like 100 of fentanyl ?

212^Ddonitz^opiate^U-51754 exists but it is rumored to be more a dissociative than a proper opiate. A guy on a forum compared it to xylazine but this is mere pillow talk. I am also eager to try U44770.... from what I read I would love it, I am just concerned about its caustic properties which appear intrinsic

212^Ddonitz^opioid^3 HO pcp is great, but I heard is almost impossible to hole on pcp analogues. However PCE is closer to MXE, so it might be possible. Again the HO residue is suspected to have a mtor agonist action, so probably it is already granted a mix of effects between a disso and an opioid. Using bucinnazine (other name for the compound you used) might have tapered off the dissociative effects of  3 HO PCP. I suggest you to try the compounds alone, however I myself never holed on 3 HO PCP (albeit I have a couple of experiences only so it can be more expert users have).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
213^Maaxxoutt^opioid^Last question i think.  I‚Äôm gonna cut out the fent and just go on üî• dope for 3 weeks then get on methadone.  Is that long enough for the fent tolerance to be gone?  Sucks but I have to do 1g per day of dope right now to just be well.  Haven‚Äôt been getting high probably because my
Sinuses are so fucked that I‚Äôm not getting the full dose.  Can‚Äôt boof either too constipated 

So is this a good plan?  1g üî• per day for 3 weeks.  Then 60mg methadone for 2 weeks then start to taper if I can for 2 months.  Then back to H or kadian if I can find it for 1 month then Ibogaine?  

Anyone who‚Äôs done Ibogaine feel free to comment.  I‚Äôm aware it doesn‚Äôt work on subs or methadone very well at all.  Has to be a fast acting opioid.

I know this sounds nuts but I just want to set myself up for success with ibo and don‚Äôt wanna be on dope the next 4
Months straight.

215^ImRickyChapman^opium^We sold some mushroom tea, we sold some ecstasy. We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP and now I hear the police coming after me!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
216^yabbadabbaduded^opiates^A couple of things - one, since you mentioned benzos and passing, from my understanding benzos clear your system super fast, so it's not too difficult to get those through and out of your system. I've also read before that a few benzos, including lorazepam, can sometimes be undetectable, period. That may have changed though, that's just what I read from a few different sources at some point in the past. So they're not a great reference to go by.

Secondly, do you know what type of test you're taking? That can make a HUGE difference in what's detectable. There are standard UDTs, the cheapest and most basic which will only verify what is in your system and will only indicate the presence of certain drugs and these types of test have a higher cutoff rate as to how much of the drug is in your system to result in being positive. That test type is different than the other types of urine screening, like a mass spectometry test. This test type has a much lower cutoff amount as far as looking to see what is in your system. So whereas a standard UDT may only test positive for say, oxycodone when a level of 50 is present, a mass spectometry test may test positive if a level of 30 or above is present. (These are just numbers for illustration, I don't actually know the actual levels used for oxycodone for the two.) Does that make sense though? That each test has different levels that make presence of a certain drug a positive or not? Basically, a mass spectometry test is MUCH more sensitive than a standard urine screen and will make you test positive for something that you may not test positive for on a standard UDT. Not only that, but a mass spectometry test does more than just verify that a drug is present - it actually can show roughly how much you've taken and when by measuring the active metabolites to the inactive metabolites. 

The other thing to note is that the cutoff levels for any type of drug is different, so never base your estimated detection time off of another drug, particularly when they're in different classes. For example, as I mentioned above, benzos generally clear the system way faster than opiates do. Our bodies also eliminate drugs in different ways. For example, my understanding is that an amphetamine like Adderall actually leaves the body through urine and isn't stored in fat, whereas marijuana gets stored in body fat and therefore stays in the body longer. 

You really need to know what type of drug test you're taking to figure out your detection time. If it's an old fashioned, cheaper urine drug test that is just checking for the presence of s drug and thus has a lower threshold as far as metabolites hanging around that will result in a positive, then 3-4 days for oxycodone is what I've seen as the detection time. However, from what I've been looking at and been told, it's more like 5 to 7 days for a mass spectometry test to show the presence of oxycodone because that test type is wayyyy more sensitive. 

I'd recommend drinking a TON of water from now to whenever your test is. Just remember to take some Vitamin B (I believe that's the vitamin to take for this) too, and do so especially right before the rest so that your urine doesn't look too  clear and therefore cause them to think you're trying to dilute your urine for some reason, as the vitamin apparently will darken your urine to a normal yellow even though you've been drinking tons of water. 

And don't forget that when calculating your half lives that the clock is basically started at the time of your last dose, so you'll want to go by your last dose regardless of how much smaller or bigger it's been compared to ones right before it. Because if you test positive for it, it's going to also show the active to inactive metabolites  (the inactive metabolites being indicators of doses you've taken that are older and stoll hanging around vs active metabolites, which will indicate the more recent doses you've taken. 

Let me know how it goes! Would be interested in hearing your results, especially if it's a mass spectometry test! 

Out of curiosity how much oxycodone did you take at your last dose and when is your drug test from that point? (For example, was your last dose taken on a Friday at noon, how much did you take then, and is your drug test the next Wednesday?) 

Hope this helps! I've been looking into this myself a lot lately because I also have a drug test coming up a little over a week from now and have been trying to find out about oxycodone and mass spectometry tests and also of taking a drug regularly effects detection level. This is all based off of my recent research so there are likely some terminology mistakes in this and its missing some suoer exact info and maybe worded terribly but Im trting to simplify it and just sharing what my understanding of it is, Im confident someone else can explain it all better, but I hope it helps or points you in the right direction of where to further research!

217^DogMeatTalk^china^People i dont think this corona virus will end the world we will recover like we did from the Spanish flu but I definitely think this corona virus will end the chinese communist party‚Äôs influence and reign over its people. 

We could have a civil war because i think everybody has opened their eyes in china to the lie they have been living and finally realise that the Chinese government must fall and rise a new democratic free country

Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if one of the chinese shills on the sub got my post removed

217^DogMeatTalk^china^i hate when i get criticised for telling people that this virus is starting to get out of hand , ‚Äúim just over obsessed ‚Äú ‚Äú the government have it under control‚Äù 
‚Äú the flu is a bigger issue than the coronavirus‚Äù all these things are responses to me talking about it to lecturers or friends,  none of them understand that this may very well get extremely out of hand , they are all trapped in their little own self important bubbles where they are more bothered about what they look like on social media than potentially saving their own lives if worse comes to worse.


 when i first heard today that they were converting sadiums and public places into isolation zones in china and using them to put hospital beds in to make makeshift wards i started to think this sounds more like something out of the movie contagion.

217^DogMeatTalk^china^china is like that one friend at school who constantly lies , honestly if china were truthful then they probably would have this thing at least under control by now

217^DogMeatTalk^china^China has also sent fake food rations over to Africa the most known one being plastic rice and fake eggs

217^DogMeatTalk^china^China are peaceful? Nah I disagree i cant explain it its too long of a story but just look it up

You have to remember they invaded tibet in the 50s and they are building islands in the Pacific to have more influence over the area as well as that they export tons of stuff to lots of countries to make countries sort of reliant and dependent on their exports so they could have sway over us if they wanted because most of are common household goods are made in china and without them we wouldn‚Äôt be able to live normally and we would have massive inflation because it costs them alot less to produce stuff than it costs are countries so we would have to raise prices .

They produce Huawei phones which have been sold in multiple countries which have allegedly  been used for spying and keeping peoples data and the company is owned by one of the members in the China‚Äôs communist party


https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-being-so-militarily-aggressive

217^DogMeatTalk^china^I would probably make the animal markets more hygienic and not have live animals their and just basic sanitary stuff you would do in a kitchen , its not a coincidence that most massive disease outbreaks come from china, its due to hygiene reasons mainly and the way they live and eat.


I would probably not restrict the flow of information and allow the people to realise  how bad it is and have learned my lesson from the sars outbreak and heavily monitor or get rid of live food markets

217^DogMeatTalk^china^What you mean??  Dog Meat Talk = DMT dude


Im not a vegan to be fair i love eating meat i just dont agree with the way wildlife markets are run in china

217^DogMeatTalk^china^How much money did you spending booking hotels seems like you booked nearly every hotel in china

217^DogMeatTalk^china^Mate not gonna lie but looking through some of your posts you seem dopey

The post ‚Äú why are so few people infected outside of china ‚Äú I think its pretty obvious, its because we actually give a shit about are citizens and dont have massive over crowding and poor hygiene.

218^thisiscarcosa^opiate^God I have so many questions for the OP but too busy right this moment to put them together so I‚Äôll come back to it - but it‚Äôs like this is first time I‚Äôve seen opiate recovery advice relevant to me -
It‚Äôs like some of it has been written for me! I‚Äôm a IN abuser of Oxy- 400-500mg daily, but some of it‚Äôs prescribed however only about 1/3rd of it.
I have tried to taper off before and end up failing - I‚Äôve also considering going on bupe but I‚Äôm in a bubble - I don‚Äôt know other addicts & I don‚Äôt know what to do for the best. I‚Äôm gonna try and have a think and come back with a few Q‚Äôs or maybe a PM. Thanks for posting üòä

218^thisiscarcosa^opiate^Bro u literally posted fent patches in your other posts - and said u had fent patches to get thru a flight and went to the toilets 9 times to smoke up! I would never judge u for having a habit - but don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôre better than that when u know as well as anyone I bet that u can‚Äôt ‚Äúplay‚Äù with this type of opiate for long before it gets real problematic real quick.

218^thisiscarcosa^opiates^Yeh I don‚Äôt mind getting sick to go on subs I understand that - but am I going from one problem to another?! Will I still feel like shit all day Cos I‚Äôm on subs - or are they going to give me some of my life back? I hear from one person they‚Äôre a miracle drug (I only want to be on short - med term at worst. I feel I could taper off subs easier simply because I can‚Äôt taper off Oxy‚Äôs as I just take them!) but other people say that you have all the same related problems from taking opiates, so I don‚Äôt know what the best route is

220^axl0586^black^Really?  I think they look so much more clean.  I do still like the old school blue wax bag with a plain black stamp however

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
221^RelevantBarnacle^black^Yeah i know, it doesn't make any sense. I was on Xanax before i started tapering and 2mgs  xanax felt a lot less sedating than 1mg valium does now. I honestly feel like I can't even take more than 1mg valium anymore because i'd black out for 8 hours.

221^RelevantBarnacle^black^Yes, i used to be the same. 10 mg daily wouldn't really do much besides keeping withdrawal at bay. At this point, and I'm genuinely not exaggerating, I think 2mg would make me black out for like 6-8 hours. If i take 1 mg I really need to focus not to fall asleep, honestly feels like 3-4mg xanax did a year ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
222^Evening-Name^opiate^I live in the United States in Ohio. I assume if I can buy it from a shop here that there are other shops like it in the United States as well.

Kratom is a plant that is supposed to have opioid-like effects. Opioid-lite almost? It's currently legal in the United States except for a couple of states. I think France banned it. I'm not sure where you live, so results may vary.

For me, it was easily accessible both from a location standpoint and price. It was $10 for an oz. I just walked into a shop and bought it with cash.

I believe head shops also sell it, but I hear bad things about the kratom that's sold there for some reason. You can also buy it from the internet, that's the most recommended approach I believe.

In my opinion, since it's legal where I live the effects are somewhat worth it if I can find the sweet spot and no other "cons" show up from reasonable usage. If the effects mellow out just a bit and I don't experience too much nasuea, I think the effects would be quite pleasant and/or a really nice sleep aid.

Based on my current experience, I can definitely see why this is used for opioid addicts to help with withdrawal symptoms/wean off opiates. I've never used opiates, so maybe someone with opiate experience would feel differently or feel the effects were rather weak.

If it was illegal, I don't think it'd be worth the potential trouble unless you're looking to wean off stronger opiates. It's certainly "nice", but it's not "risking jail time or losing a job nice."

But everyone is different. I've tried other drugs here and there, but I haven't fell in "love" with any of them so to speak. Your mileage may vary.

If you're interested in Kratom and end up buying it, don't start at  3g. I would say start at 1g. Use a scale and don't eyeball it.  If you don't feel anything, wait a couple days and up the dosage by .5g. Rinse and repeat until you feel something. I personally wouldn't go past 4g because if you go above a certain threshold with Kratom either by overdosing or by trying to take more to prolong a good feeling, you will just get sick instead. Sweats, shakes, nausea...etc. Everybody is different, maybe some people need 8gs of it to get an effect, but I feel like it's not worth it at that point.

I also wouldn't re-dose in the same day. You can re-dose, but it's better to play it safe. It's super important that you don't take it everday. Kratom has shitty withdrawal symptoms too, similar to opioids but less severe. You don't want to deal with it.

There have been small reports of liver toxicity and kratom. As in, some people's livers might not be able to break down kratom properly.  I've only seen these reports from people who take it every day and the symptoms seem to stop after abstaining. I haven't seen any reported fatalities in that regard, but it's something to be aware of in any case.

Oh also, it tastes super bitter. It's not pleasant. I personally didn't understand the big fuss about the taste, I definitely wasn't about to puke like some reports. Kratom doesn't dissolve well in water, but I find it dissolves quite nicely in some homemade almond milk. Apparently people have had issues with kratom clumping and sticking to their mouths when they've used store bought almond milk, so you might want to watch out for that.

223^vibrantax^opiates^2cb is the only semi common one you didn't list

In pharmaceuticals, there's all benzodiazepines and more opiates such as oxycodone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
224^tcb118^opiates^I have low blood pressure and anemia and tbh when I get real light headed and abour to pass out from lack of o2 its kinda feeling, like nitros ozide kinda cool not gonna lie.... and I have no clue what would happen if you pass out.

But lets be honest you got oxy40s youre gonna pass out at some point anyways. I rarely use opiates so im really not the guy to ask about doses sorry man but best of luck

224^tcb118^opiates^The XR stands for eXtended Release aka less high but lasts longer... stay safe on them opiates... im an upper guy myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
225^HotSunShower^opiate^I think it was best said that this neuro doc and her nursing team are taking this extremely personally.  
From what I‚Äôve read here Clonidine seems like the perfect helper for opiate withdrawal in my case. I don‚Äôt even know what beta blockers are that I was asked about when I asked for something in the Clonidine family or Clonidine-like. All I know is that question was met with more scorn. 

I‚Äôm trying to get in with a new doctor. Most are telling me they aren‚Äôt accepting new patients. The others have a weeks/months long waiting period. I‚Äôm sighing up for two waitlists at the moment. Last option I‚Äôve been considering is the ER. I‚Äôm not having quite an emergency yet. Yet!

225^HotSunShower^opiate^What other non opiate meds would be ideal? Like the ones she prescribed me a handful of? 
Yeah I need to do some work to figure this out.  It‚Äôs obvious to me I need not do any more figuring on my own. 
I was not expecting hugs and kisses but not expecting her reaction either.  I went to her for help and now I feel like I should have kept my mouth shut and tried to taper on my own.

225^HotSunShower^black^Yes, I decreased the dose by 500mg at one time initially. Thought it would be easier to drop them quicker up front than at the end where I‚Äôve read here and other places it‚Äôs much harder to step down from at the end because of the withdrawal. 

No I didn‚Äôt black out for two days.  I dropped the middle dose of 10 pills the first day. Later that evening I took ten more like usual. Instead of 10 x3 a day I only took 10x 2. The next day WDs were mostly sweating and feeling a little shaky and strange. No appetite. 
I took the regular dose of 10 that morning.  Ten more in the evening. I thought to myself  this isn‚Äôt so bad!  WRONG. 

The day after that was when I woke up and felt like I was about to die.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
226^perc31andsalami^dreams^agreed! they usually end with me in a panic. i don‚Äôt enjoy being high every day or even most days of the week but it feels better for me. i don‚Äôt have intense dreams or nicotine cravings

226^perc31andsalami^gum^chew gum homie, you jaw will get too tired before your gums get sore or teeth ache

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
227^BlueWindows1^opiates^If you want to quit bad enough you can but it‚Äôs going to take a lot of discipline and willpower. For me personally it really helped coming clean to pretty much everyone in my life and leaning on my loved ones for support. Telling the truth and living honestly is such a great high that‚Äôs so much more rewarding than opiates.

227^BlueWindows1^opiates^For me personally I got abused painkillers when I got my wisdom teeth removed and my doctor refilled my script 3x. I was around 15 and had never abused opiates before. I didn‚Äôt become a full blown addict until my last 20‚Äôs but when I discuss my use of history with doctors and drug counselors this is where I start from. I started raiding my moms and grandmothers medicine cabinets too.

228^marduk123789^opiates^My minds been opened to a lot of things. Like how all my problems in life have been caused by opiates. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve went to the doctors for stomach problems, anxiety, sleep problems. How many times I‚Äôd been to the psych ward for depression suicide. I feel like a totally normal person now. Why‚Äôd it take me 23 years to piece this all together? I just hope my pay doesn‚Äôt come back to haunt me to much

228^marduk123789^china^Idk about mole people but I could def see the virus escaping this facility. I mean SARS happened in China too. You play w fire you get burnt

229^Jambiman333^black^I actually recall hearing that something like only 10-20 percent if not significantly less than that number of people who do meth are addicted and do it irresponsibly and with great detriment to their life. The guy is a professor at John Hopkins I think he did a ted talk and was on Joe rogans podcast, a black guy with long dreads. He studied drug addiction and specifically methamphetamine and his findings really challenge the common consensus on hard drugs. don't quote me on the statistics but yeah most drug users are not addicted. My guess is when we consider the consequences of meth and heroin we only look at the toothless homeless junkies and not the business man or mother who is using and is in control.

229^Jambiman333^opiates^With stims redosing does work but leads to way worse comedowns as the second dose generally masks the negative effects of the first dose starting to  set in by the time you need to dose again. By the time the second dose wears off you'll have been clenching your jaw and tensing your muscles for a good 16 hours straight with no food and improper hydration.
That's how people manage to stay up with no sleep for 5 days on meth and in some cases seem fine until they crash. It catches up with you soon enough always but you can mask the comedown with enough powder. God what awful memories.....


Opiods are the best drug in the sense of redosing as long as you have enough. Because they replace your brains endorphin and act in the same way you do not experience the diminishing effect of amps where there is no dopamine left in your brain for it to release, with opiates you will be able to achieve the same effects Everytime with the right dose. Tolerance does build however and once you build it your dose will not decrease for a while. 

The worse drugs to redose are probably psychedelics in that they pretty much do nothing after the first dose in any 2 day timeframe. 
Marijuana is actually most enjoyable spacing it out too but redosing will never fail to get you higher. 
Benzos are easily redosable same sorta deal as the opiates but dependency is pure evil

229^Jambiman333^opiates^Yeah it's weird. At one point it seemed to get me quite stoned . My pupils would be pins and I felt all warm and fuzzy. But mostly it doesn't seem to do anything. I would bet it would help relieve some of the withdrawal from opiates

229^Jambiman333^opiates^This is why people shouldn't even try those kinds of drugs once. Opiates and amphetamines both can and probably will trigger something in a person's brain that just can't be turned off and that overpowers a person's rational mind. If your predisposed to addiction and there's no real way of knowing if you are or not until it's too late then you will get hooked even trying these drugs once or twice

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
230^happy_realm^china^See immigration policy for China, India, the UAE and many other. ounties who all profile by race. These are extremely  racist.policies ( skin color) but shhhhhh the mass media will never even mention it while it allows name calling on its country own administion.


But hey! Orange man bad, right! Source: I lived in all these countries.

230^happy_realm^china^It's been said it's 75% ethanol and 25% water, as a mist. Who knows what it actually is until someone from China takes a sample and analyse it.

230^happy_realm^china^You don't need to look far to find a metric fuckton of comments justifying and rationalizing violence IRL. They are left unscathed. Sometimes upvoted (a lot). It just happens that all of these are all targeted at one very specific political view. Most of the others get the banhammer and quick, and if not, they are left up to justify quarantining the sub. Reddit is political, and received 150m from china last year. Connect the dots.

230^happy_realm^china^And that's sad. We need an alternative to reddit if its a one party system that censors, bans and shut down all alternative discussion. What is this, China? The irony is reddit is controlled by billionaires. Some 'community' that is... /s Anyways, as i said, nothing against you, sorry if my comment was misconstrued. Cheers.

230^happy_realm^china^I think people now believe it's serious but only in China. And its a bit like theses videos of H5N1 culling - thousands of pigs burnt alive or birds buried alive. People find it upsetting but it's 'not their backyard'.

Sadly it looks like humans only care about their direct environment.

230^happy_realm^opiate^Thank you. I abused codeine then dihydrocodeine eons ago, but never oxys, so i approach all drugs as if they were brand new conceptually and chemically speaking (kept me alive all this time). Reddit returned 5mg of oxycontin IR as being 'enough for an opiate naive person' on several search results so it's good to hear that 40mg won't kill me dead. 

THank you for your reply. As an aside, considering how much they cost, it's suprising how weak they are. I guess this is the price people pay for not having to be 'tagged' as junkies by people who know they use drugs, but sheesh, boy is it pricy this stuff. Oh well...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
231^Copegrin_2014^opiates^If you can get through the first 3-4 days with the benzos helping with sleep in my experience most physical symptoms will rapidly dissipate...then it will be a mental game ...I also 2nd the kratom suggestion it will greatly help with symptoms and should also provide a good deal of pain relief ...I myself have a torn rotator cuff and find that kratom does more for me than hydrocodone ever did for pain relief....I would suggest finding a red strain of Kratom for during  the evening( red strains have a more sedating effect) and a green strain for in the morning (green strains are more stimulating) ...I found that kratom not only was much more effective for inflammation but also seems to be effective for much longer....I would take norcos every 6 to 8 hours for the pain... but when taking kratom i found relief for up to 18 hours at times. As far as dosing kratom seeing that you have prior experience and tolerance with opiates your dosage will need to be higher than what the typical starting dose is. I would recommend starting in the 5 to 7 gram range and then adjust dosage according to what you feel is effective. 

Kratom imo is a very underrated and unappreciated  herb as far as its painkilling properties and its ability to comfort withdrawl symptoms... 

Feel free to message me if you have any other questions hope this helps

232^fml2021^opioid^Opioid addiction is serious brother. If you‚Äôre buying those little blue oxys of the street you‚Äôre most likely getting fentanyl which is worse than heroin. I have an alcohol addiction that I‚Äôve had since I was 16 for the same reason. The only thing I‚Äôve found is working on myself and getting sober is the only way to feel happy again. Eat healthier, work out, read, and go after your goals. No girl will every love or respect you if you don‚Äôt love and respect yourself brother.

234^mandygator^opiate^So awesome. Thank you for sharing. I was an opiate addicted teenager throughout high school who hated most of my classmates, was quite depressed and angsty and i thought opiates were the answer or at least a welcome reprieve from the drain that was school. Keep us updated!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
235^dton1996^opioid^I completely agree with you. He seems very narcissistic and titi was amazing. If you come to the same conclusion as I did regarding him and opioid epidemic, you'll probably dislike him even more than you do now at the end. It is a good doc though

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
236^REDDIT_SUCKS_LOTS^opioid^From when I used to take codeine recreationally a lot I was always under the impression the more u took just backed up to be metabolised. After a certain point my buzz never increased it just lasted longer. This is completely anecdotal though, and I was never a huge opioid lover so could just be me however

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
237^throwawayopiates9876^opiate^I got a blood test after 10 years of opiate use and my liver was judged to be fine. I've also known other heavy pill users who miraculously turned out to have done no damage to themselves after years of abuse. 

I suspect you're fine, to be honest. Just be sure to taper down, eat healthy, get exercise, drink plenty of water - all the basic stuff. 

Your body adapts to Paracetamol over time. So a first-time user who pops 8 pills would probably be more at risk than you, who built up your usage over time. 

I've seen alcohol destroy more livers than paracetamol. Don't worry too much.

237^throwawayopiates9876^opium^All opiates will fuck with your vision eventually. Light sensitivity is common. There's even a passage in some ancient Greek text from 2,500 years ago about opium users having bad eyesight. Particularly sensitivity to light, and worsened night vision.

237^throwawayopiates9876^opiate^I could direct you to some useful videos if you want to see where I got these ideas from. 

I'm in the process of learning about it myself right now, but ever since I had these realizations I've started to understand and deal with things better. Anxiety is basically gone. Anger has been significantly reduced. 

There's a meme around here that says something like "Opiates are the fastest way to God", and it's right. 

It's right, because you need to be in a truly desperate, fucked up situation (like opiate withdrawal) to even be humble enough to look up at the ceiling and ask an invisible person for help. But, it's also in those situations that you find that invisible person. 

From a strictly psychological perspective, that's because opposites highlight each other. Like, it's only when you're thirsty that you truly appreciate water. It's only when it's dark that you start to appreciate light. 

And sometimes it takes going to hell before you get the idea that its opposite must be possible. When you do realize this, suddenly your life has a new, permanent purpose and meaning.   


Btw, my inbox is open if you want to chat or whatever.

238^mmjarec^opiate^Afraid of the over hyped opiate crisis? This is your chance to put a dent in it. If you think both are bad anyone with experience with both will tell you weed is the least bad option. It helps with everything related to opiates, Withdrawls, cravings, amount consumed

238^mmjarec^opiates^Actually just a week ago my pain management doctor who is supposed to be a pro in opiates told me the dentist should have given me three days of hydrocodone. Nobody is on the same page that‚Äôs the problem

238^mmjarec^opiate^Yeah and their parents have the balls to blame the people taking them responsibly and their prescribers instead of their idiot child who took a mega dose with no tolerance.

It‚Äôs not an opiate epidemic. Never has been. It‚Äôs an epidemic of stupidity

238^mmjarec^opiates^And that clearly isn‚Äôt working ,  fentanyl use and deaths have skyrocketed why others have gone down. The whole scheduling system is a joke they put tramadol which is synthetic and has a complete different method of action than regular opiates from poppies. It‚Äôs so arbitrary it‚Äôs horse shit. Look where they have weed as well as mdma both which have huge benefits for psychological therapy of ptsd and others. It makes no sense for pharmacies to refuse to fill scripts for old ladies that aren‚Äôt abusing them. Just look at Walgreens getting sued for human rights violations. This shit has gone overboard.

238^mmjarec^opiates^Oh well I‚Äôm glad you provided factual info. Sorry I usually take things the wrong way I‚Äôm so used to being lectured about why I‚Äôm wrong most of the time about opiates. A good pharmacist goes a long way but I‚Äôve rarely seen one actually not slack off one way or another usually it‚Äôs not checking something they should and then giving me wrong info or blaming others when I know they can fill on day 29 unless specified by a doctor. The problem is you can‚Äôt even find Walgreens narcotics refill policy and even the state specific policies don‚Äôt mention refill days at least I can‚Äôt find anything but how scripts can be transmitted and that kind of thing.

238^mmjarec^opiate^Different road for us all but the theory behind the meme holds true starts off innocent and fun then at some point you can‚Äôt function without them. 

Read the ER guidelines for opiate prescribe they are supposed to prescribe no more than 30 hydros for a shattered limb. Fucking insane. Federal horse shit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
239^Pettyshopstories^opiate^Haha, for sure my friend :) I can tell you know your shit as well! Always a pleasure to meet someone well versed in pharms. 

Yeah, detoxing off Opana is NOT on my list of things to do ever lol. The worst opiate detox I had was from methadone; I titrated from 70mg to 40mg and then just stopped showing up to the clinic (yep, I was that naive, young and dumb lol).
A week later it hit like a train going 200mph all at once; nausea, dysphoria, the usual...but the sense of lethargy/tiredness and the bone aches were OUT of control. I ended up using Kratom and successfully used it to get through the rest of the WDs, it took away about 70-75% of the WD feelings. 

Opana seems like it would be even worse as it's *literally* the most potent pharmaceutical form of oxycodone on the market (besides Laudnum but I've never met anyone before whose even tried it). 

Years ago, I had a huge addiction to 10mg Percocet, 7.5mg Endocet and 4.75mg Percodan (with the odd Nucynta 100mg and Darvocet N-100 thrown in). I was using 70-120mg of Oxycodone/ tons of APAP (no idea how my liver still works) every other day or every day when I could. 
I had a very close friend with a 10mg Percocet script and lived with my best friend whose Grandma is an opiate addict and had HUGE scripts of Soma 350mg (she literally got fuckin 500 of those a month!), Percocet 10mg/325mg APAP&5mg/325mg APAP, Norco 10mg/325mg APAP, OxyContin 10mg, Darvocet N-100 (100mg propoxyphene napsylate/*650*mg APAP, such a weird drug), and others I'm forgetting. 
The withdrawal from just the oxycodone and APAP was SO bad...that's actually when I started using harder opiates like OxyContin 80mg/Roxicet 40mg so that I didn't feel the WD from just plain old low dose oxycodone/apap. 

If you don't mind me asking, how did you get Opana? The dealer I knew that sold it had fatal AIDS. Do you have chronic pain? 

Second question - have you tried any form of Darvocet and if so do you remember it/enjoy the high? I used to like those better than Codeine, but that 650mg APAP was a literal killer, and i either got high or felt nothing. 
I *always* wanted to try Darvon, which is Proproxyphene Hydrochloride in 65mg and 100mg dose capsules and NO APAP. The hydroxhloride version is stronger than the napsylate version, and I've heard they were awesome from my Grandparents who used to know people that slammed it (drug abuse runs strong in our family but luckily none of us got hooked on the needle).

I'm super curious about your answers to my questions, hit me back when you can! Thanks and much love brother!

239^Pettyshopstories^opiate^Thank you for listening, it means alot to me, thank you! 

I went through a big opiate phase in my late teens/early 20s and Opana/Oxymorphone was the holy Grail back then. I preferred it over 80mg OxyContins - one 40mg ER Opana would have me GOING man! What was the WD like from Opana? I wouldn't want to go through that, sounds painful as all hell. The Oxy ordeal is what got me hooked on fucking Suboxone, of course. 

I'm not an MD but I'm definitely an extremely qualified "street pharmacist", the Nurses PDR which lists every prescription drug on the market, each pills dosing, side effects, brand names, what schedule it's in (for instance, all Barbiturates are C-II except for Fioricet which has 50mg Butalbital per tablet and is a C-III, and oddly enough Phenobarbital is a 
C-IV like Benzodiazepines) basically everything a doctor would know about RX compounds and meds. It
was my Bible, I read it everyday to the point that I have it basically memorized ;)

Klonopin, brand name for Clonazepam, has up to a 60 hour half life (long half life, I think only Valium and Librium are longer), 90% protein binding (meaning it binds extremely well physically), 90% BA which is extremely high (BA=bioavailability, so how much gets in your bloodstream), and its effect, or 'high', lasts 6-12 hours. It's one of, if not *the* most potent benzodiazepine available in the US. All of this *sounds* scary, but Clonazepam is one of the most reliable and safe benzos (*an example of an unsafe benzo is Halcion/Triazolam. It's got a 6 hour half life, works orally after about 5 minutes, and can cause hallucinations and obliteration for those without benzo experience/tolerance and has tons of side effects like forgetting where you are or who your mom is lol*). 

*You are on a low and safe dose* .5 or 1mg is low and appropriate as opposed to the idiot who gave me 6mg Klonopin / day and 400mg Phenobarbital daily. 

*What you need to remember is that Klonopin builds up in your system; this is a good and a bad thing*
It's good because like you said, if you run out, you won't feel sick until day 4 or 5, *BUT this is only if you take it on a regular basis* Since you've been on it for a year or years and take it semi frequently, your in a good position where you have a tiny theraputic amount in your system. *Based of what your telling me, I know you wouldn't seize out and I bet the worst of it would be heightened anxiety, maybe insomnia and some panic attacks*

I have a suggestion that will answer your question. *Stop taking your Klonopin asap and see how long it takes before you feel ill*
If you're lucky, you may have very mild WDs or possibly not have any symptoms at all as I mentioned above 
*This means you aren't hardcore physically addicted, meaning you can continue using it as needed and won't need to worry about seizures or having withdrawals*

However, to be honest, Klonopin binds so tightly to your GABA B - *think about that protein binding I talked about above and the strong 90% bioavailability* - *that I honestly think you'd need to taper slowly at home, or spend a short amount of time (probably 6 days to 1.5 weeks depending on how you handle WDs) in an inpatient detox* if you wanted completely off. 

*However, i AM 100% sure that you could easily get completely off of it if you wanted to without a huge hassle*
I think you could do it at home by titrating your regular dose slowly to zero. 

*It would look like this - taking your normal .5 or 1mg daily (start as low as you can comfortably), 2 days of normal doses, then cut a 1/4 off the 1mg pill and continue with that lowered dose for 2-3 more days and then cut a 1/4 of the pill again, etc etc until you're taking a 1/4 of a .5mg Klonopin for as long as you need to be comfortable, and then just stop* 

Personally, I'd do an inpatient detox bc they're like a vacation - you just chill on a unit while they detox you. You attend AA/NA and watch tons of TV and sometimes make some really good friends. Or even better, have casual sex - Im happily engaged and have been for 6 months now and wouldn't change it for anything, but when I was single I smashed at every detox, rehab and sober living I went too (it's easier when your gay lol). 

Bottom line, you're at a low risk and could easily titrate off over 2 weeks at home if you have will power, and you seem like you do!

239^Pettyshopstories^black^Sorry, my phone died before I could edit this. You hit the nail on the head man! Tekken is *too* intense now imo, especially with the constant de ranking, in fact imo the ranking system in T7 is absolute shit (the blue ranks are HELL until you're out of them). No one likes to be demoted and since everyone is, everyone is pissy most of the time (besides the Gods of Tekken like Lil Majin, Victim of Ritual, Knee etc).

You're also 100% correct about the emotion part as well. Even though it's cringy as hell, I have an emotional attachment to Nina as a character; I actually did martial arts because of how cool her throws and moves were and now have a black belt 1st Dan in Hapkido (did it 11 years every other day) and am well versed in Aikido. 
I also identify with her personality which I don't want to get into, plus she looks like a young Michelle Pfeiffer (I think Michelle Pfeiffer is the hottest woman alive and actually have an outfit/hair based on Pfeiffer's character in Scarface lol) and is truly lethal in the right hands. 

Nina has always been more challenging to master than most other characters, from her chain throws in Tekken 1 to her insane difficulty in Tekken 7 (though they did tone her difficulty from 'extreme as fuck' down to 'really hard' in S3, no more x5 iWS1 combos constantly) which gives me a sense of pride that I know how to use her effectively, which I think is true of most serious Nina players. Most Nina mains I know are like me, in their 30s (I'm 31) and have been maining her since the original Tekken. I literally play no one but Nina until I've mastered her in that particular game, and then I'll start maining others (Jun and Michelle in T1&T2, Anna, Xiayou, Julia and Jin in T3, Anna in TTT, Steve and Lee in T4, Lee again in T5, Feng in T6 and Negan and Kazuya in T7. 

*Basically what I'm saying is my main focus is always on Nina and (serious) Nina mains grew with her throughout the series. I take Tekken too seriously and have since online play began*

That's some solid advice, and I'm gonna take it. Thank you bro.

240^MrWinston5^gum^Breathe deeply, have a break in the fresh air, chew a gum or suck on a hard candy whenever you feel the urge to light up a cigarette. If you eventually give up and you smoke one after that just think "did I really need that? Do I feel better after inhaling this shit? Do I really need cigarettes to go back to baseline?" 
I know it's hard to quit but you must focus on negative aspects of smoking because that's no positive ones. 
Stay strong my brother!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
241^lifemedic1ne^opioid^I know that morphine dosages are somewhere between 10-50 mg, but since this si morphine sulfate I suppose it's somewhat different. 

If your calculations are true, when I was IVing 100 mg (and one time also as high as 150 mg) that would be equal as 133 mg oxycodone which is insane and I would be dead. I was nodding and pretty shitfaced from 40mg IV and that was when I had a H habit.

I'd really want to know how and why are sulfate doses so higher but can't find the info anywhere. Here where I'm from these 200 mg capsules are the only ones they have in the opioid replacement therapy and if they would be giving them to anyone who comes for the treatment, something would go wrong quickly. This is why I am convinced 200 mg od sulfate =/= 200 mg standard morphine.

Could you link me to those charts you mentioned?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
242^somethingherion^black^Did everything just like, go black? Or was it like an progression. I‚Äôve heard stories of people who have died and been brought back and they have like a weird thing about flashbacks and stuff, did you experience any of that? Again i don‚Äôt want to offend anybody bc I know this is hard to talk about, just sort of want to know what my cousin went through before she passed away

242^somethingherion^opiates^I had a pretty minor addiction in comparison to most addicts, I quit without rehab, haven‚Äôt done NA, not to say I wasn‚Äôt sick but my addiction was not nearly to the extent of others. 
I only quit because my apartment got raided by 12 and I was scared of getting arrested, but it‚Äôs only a misdemeanor where I live to be caught in possession of ANY narcotic so that fear is sort of diminishing. A lot of people tell me to just give it some time and really think about it but this feeling has been going on for about 2 weeks now. It isnt getting better only stronger, I have no reason not to do, especially since I have zero tolerance now to opiates, chipping is easy enough I‚Äôve done it plenty. I just fucking miss being happy. I‚Äôm on lithium currently for my bipolar2, I go to therapy once a week, I can‚Äôt take antidepressants since they somehow throw me into ‚Äúpsychosis‚Äù, nothing helps. Not even Kratom . I still want some dope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
243^midnightmemori3s^opiates^Straight fent I believe ... does not show up on a 12 panel drug test for opiates . Only way I have failed is when they use the fentanyl test strip. Super odd .. maybe it‚Äôs just all in my head lol. But I used to be hooked on H for years and it was horrible when I was sick. Thanks for your reply.. appreciate it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
244^realcat67^opiate^I am not claiming this for anyone else, but for me, MAT is the worst of both worlds. I'm not getting high, not enjoying it, but at the same time, I am a slave to it. I have to take it every day. I have to suffer the subtle side effects that no one talks about (hormonal changes, brain chemistry, etc.).  I don't know what motivated you to come and show us the light, but if you spent more than 5 minutes on this sub, you would see that probably at least 20% of the posts deal with how to handle withdrawal. 

It's not like there is a scarcity of information here. So yes, at this point, I am wondering why there is a big push for MAT coming out of nowhere, looking like a college term paper. In my view, this entire subject is a justification for what is basically a crime to begin with. It's like, ok, you guys can have your alcohol and your pot, but opiates are highly illegal, still, and we are going to continue to make your lives miserable by restricting opiate use in every possible way. 

And people keep dying while the pharmaceutical companies (and doctors) keep making money.

Please don't talk to me about harm reduction on one hand while the government keeps locking people up with the other. It's a really bad joke.

244^realcat67^opiates^That is really interesting. For some reason, the first thing to go when I start getting high is my desire to play music. I am already one of the world's worst musicians but opiates take away my musical balance.

Some people say drugs make them more creative, but I have never found this to be true. The only thing they make me is sleepy.

244^realcat67^opiate^The one good thing about cold turkey is you know that you are getting through it as fast as possible. When you take any other opiate you may or may not prolong the wd. There is no way to know without testing it. I went cold turkey from a long term heroin habit and it did take several weeks, but eventually you will feel better. There are tons of posts listing all the comfort meds you can get that can help you, like benzos and clonidine. But arrange it now because you will probably not be able to do much once you start.

244^realcat67^black^Amazing. It is so easy to forget about all those things that happened to you, or that you made happen. But when you see them in black and white, it is overwhelming. The flair labels this as a story, but it sounds right on to me. I admire your ability to write something like this. I don't think I could.

244^realcat67^opiates^I look forward to the day someone finally understands addiction. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters. My mom, my dad, my siblings, were all insane overachievers who have the house with the white picket fence. I have nothing but admiration for my parents. The other family members? Let's just say I didn't make their lives easy.

We have no history of addiction in the family, as far back as we can trace it into Germany and Russia. One sister enjoys a glass of wine from time to time. My other sister has migraines but she takes her meds as prescribed.

I went to the best school my parents could find. I never suffered any sort of abuse. Everybody liked me at school, even though I could be a jerk at times.  I always got invited to parties, people wanted me to hang out, etc.

We all went to college, became professionals. Money was never an issue. I had a number of jobs over the years and loved most of them. On the outside, I never had any problems until I started getting busted for cashing in fake percocet scripts. But I had that rigged so I never did any prison time.

On the inside, no matter how good things seemed, I always felt like there was a hole. When I was exposed to opiates, it seemed to fill that hole for the first time. You guys have heard all that before.

So how do I end up a hardcore iv heroin addict? How do I try to compare my life with that of Dark\_Btrfly? I can't. There is no comparison. It makes no sense.

244^realcat67^opiate^This is an interesting topic, and it would be great if there were actual research. At 2.5 mg per day, you really should not feel any withdrawal symptoms. Yet, there are plenty of people that have said they experienced wd even at very low levels.

One of the better posts I have seen was from a guy suggesting that you form a liquid solution for ultra low doses. Like dissolving 10 mg of oxy in 10cc of water to make your taper accurate.

Because realistically, with the half life of oxy at 4 - 6 hours, it is questionable whether the dose actually does anything. Idk. Eventually you would reach the point where you would effectively have zero opiates in your system. But we don't know what happens with extremely low levels. Maybe some people have to have zero levels of outside opiates to begin recovering their own, natural opiate production. 

Some people say that tapering just prolongs the whole process and they have to go cold turkey in the end. Other people say that tapering works really well. There are too many unknowns to be able to say for sure.

But I do think switching to kratom would be a good idea, if you can be disciplined with your dosage.

244^realcat67^opiate^There is no induction with methadone. It is more like a longer acting opiate. It takes a day or two to build up in your system, but that's it. Some people say it makes them foggy and has other side effects. I was on it years ago but have never touched it since then.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
245^elliotobii^opiates^It‚Äôs amazing until it‚Äôs hell, I had this same idea in mind, I wish I could leave the opiates alone and just go back to having depression because the lows I experience now are so much lower than I thought was possible. I see death as the only escape that will leave me at peace and not in constant turmoil. Just my 2 centz

245^elliotobii^opiates^This this thiss thanks for saying this, I‚Äôm just now figuring out that opiates have and will lead me to more misery if I just keep using them expecting something different to happen

245^elliotobii^opiates^It‚Äôs funny how you start to hate something you once loved so much, After a certain amount of years the hate seems to outweigh the love at times but the love for opiates is still so strong, at least for me

245^elliotobii^opiate^For ppl who are opiate naive it‚Äôs very strong, U could‚Äôve probably only took 1mg and still got high for 12 hours. I‚Äôm on sub maintenance trying to quit shooting heroin and it doesn‚Äôt really get me high at all but helps a lot w cravings, for ppl who need it it‚Äôs a great tool but is also a cost effective way to get high for others which I‚Äôm honestly all about just know that after about a week of taking it all the recreational effects will go away and then the wd does suck

245^elliotobii^opiates^I have never been on methadone  so I have no comparison but Now that I‚Äôve been on them for a couple months they really don‚Äôt get rid of my ‚Äú I need opiates in my veins now‚Äù anymore, They helped a ton at the beginning but at this point I am just taking them to stave off the physical symptoms, The only time I feel genuine relief from fiendish thoughts is if I stop the subs for a couple days then go back on them and for the first day it‚Äôs alright but the next day is more of the same. Honestly I just want to ween off them so I can do shoot some dope. :/

245^elliotobii^opiates^Codeine is just badly metabized into morphine, Cut out the middle man and do some morphine with Benadryl and it‚Äôs the same fucking feeling, Lean really is one of the lowest tier opiates it‚Äôs not worth home brewing lol

245^elliotobii^opiates^You right, I‚Äôm working on getting clean from opiates, Mostly just reminiscing about how fucking good they felt. Nothing else can compare.

245^elliotobii^opiate^That just goes to show how strong bupe is, Yeah 2 mg would probably be way too much for someone with no opiate experience. I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs a cheaper opiate out there that‚Äôs not gonna be laced with fent

245^elliotobii^opiate^I‚Äôve found that taking it every other day gives it much more of an oomph but u have to go to every other day without it which suck but I‚Äôve found this way to actually give me good relief when I do take it.  I also tend to feel more of an opiate felling after a vigorous workout

245^elliotobii^opioid^Thanks for the response, I‚Äôm guessing that drug X could be a pgp inhibitor like piperine in black pepper or omeprazole maybe? I guess I‚Äôm going to have to do some trials of my own. I know that when I have taken loperamide for opioid withdrawals that omeprazole and black pepper helped it to work which leads me to believe the same could be done for bupe possibly.

245^elliotobii^opiates^You can still toss the crushed shit on the foil just fine and smoke it, I‚Äôd recommend staying away from opiates after this because relying on them really is hell and quitting them is even worse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
246^Purple-Builder^opiates^Yeah i know alot of smokers as i am also one myself but the issue is as im not in the city anymore just a smaller coastal town none of the people i know that use recreational drugs have any experience with opiates letalone have any idea where to find them... but i will keep searching slowly but surely fingers crossed i find them üò•

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
247^mesanewnickname^dreams^Huh, I used to have weird and vivid dreams when sleeping high, now sadly not as much dreams. Btw, I just got my braces on couple days ago, my teeth hurt a lot, now I want to light up even more, but I gotta wait, gotta need to be patient.

Hold in there mate, after 2 weeks, feeling of lighting up will fade away.

247^mesanewnickname^black^btw, I seem to can not capture my display for some reason, its black screen, and doesnt show anything, I tried display capture, window capture, game capture for minecraft, it did not work, its just black screen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
248^i-ambebe^dreams^I think a lot of my dreams come from my fear of dying in my sleep. My mind maybe be running to much before bed! I need to get over that because I know I don‚Äôt take that much but never knew if it was possible to die even on small amounts. Just stupid fears that come with my high anxiety personality tbh

248^i-ambebe^dreams^Mine are so vivid I get like reality and dreams mixed up! I hate it haha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
249^fishscalecola13^black^I went to a rehab called Black Bear Lodge, my roommate was coming off that, dude was having seizures daily, looked horrible. They were loading him up with phenobarbital. Be careful detoxing off that dude, seriously.

249^fishscalecola13^black^I remember having some years ago, its drawl up damm near black. Shit got me high tho.

249^fishscalecola13^opiate^DEFINETLYYYY just smoke bud if that helps. I dont wish opiate addiction on anyone, I struggle with it deeply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
250^theunknowndrugexpert^black^Probably because you have a decent tolerance, take triple your dose you'll feel the effects foresure or you might just black out lmao.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
251^str8b8ir8^opiate^I have no advice but i am extremely jealous you're able to have that as your opiate of choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
252^Layne_Cobain^opiate^Interesting thanks. I thought it didn‚Äôt matter the opiate or strength they just didn‚Äôt cause retrograde amnesia like benzos but fent definitely does

252^Layne_Cobain^black^Yeh I 100 percen t get what you‚Äôre saying but I know for a fact it can‚Äôt be benzos in ir because I‚Äôve taken daily benzo for ten years and can fans 15 mfg or Xanax and feel nothing and not black out for a second so my tolerance fonbenzosnallows me to know it isn‚Äôt benzo involved. Anything else? No idea what vinyls be nnn I t besides thay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
253^SugarMagnolia96^black^It has cross tolerance with Valium, and if the 15mg Valium dosage you mentioned is accurate, an equivalent dose of Xanax would be 1mg. I‚Äôd say to start there and wait about 30 minutes to see how you feel. If you can handle the taste, dissolving it under your tongue will make it kick in even faster (not sure if you‚Äôre still having panic attacks, but if so I‚Äôd use this route of administration). Xanax is also a muscle relaxer, which should help give you some relief too. Hope that does the trick, but if not and you have more access you can take another .25mgs just don‚Äôt go over 2mgs total cause you might black out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
254^MrAtreus420^opiate^Thats surprising to hear. I myself am I heavy opiate user but like all opiate users (except for yourself apparently lol) I looooove me some benzos. Every ope dope I've ever met or used with has had a love for benzos as well.

254^MrAtreus420^opiate^Yeah not very many people realize the spectrum of opiate users. Most are people like me with prescriptions to oxy or something along those lines that ended up having to turn to the street when this so called epidemic hit and all the doctors got afraid of the dea coming to send them to jail for trying to give their patients a better life. Most people dont realize how intensely chronic pain can fuck up your life. Even if that isnt the case only a small number of opiate addicts are the people going around robbing everyone and using dirty needles they find laying by the dumpster outside of the local hospital. Most opiate addicts are very intelligent individuals leading very normal lives and just prefer the warm hug of an oxy rather than drinking that box of wine or 6 pack of beer inside damn near every American fridge.

254^MrAtreus420^opiates^Don't mix the diazepam or temazepam with that. It will slow breathing down incredibly. I have asthma myself and can tell you for sure that if you don't have a high enough tolerance to opiates and mix valium with that you will either need a breathing treatment or you will od

254^MrAtreus420^opiate^Kpins and xans take the same amount of time to breakdown and release the drug and the feeling would hit you at the same time. However, kpins have a longer half life so the narcotic effect would last longer but it would be pretty fucking hard to distinguish whether you were feeling alprazolam or clonazepam. Impossible to distinguish if already in an opiate and benzo stupor imo

254^MrAtreus420^opiates^Most definitely man. She would have died had I not done it. The fucked up part about addiction is that even though I knew it had to be done I tried every other way I could think of before resorting to pharmaceuticals not because that's what you should do in any case of any medical situation but because I didn't want to ruin her high and make it to where she wouldnt be able to feel the drugs for the next few days.... Thats extremely sad and it hurts to admit it but that is the grip hard opiates and addiction have on a person.

254^MrAtreus420^opiate^The best feeling I ever had was 10 Watson blues, 5mg of kpins, and about 6 shots of whiskey. This would kill regular opiate and benzos naive people though and even sone with tolerance

254^MrAtreus420^opiates^My tolerance comes from the fact that my very first experience with opiates was with 80mg oxy nasally. Very very quickly I graduated to intravenous use with my friends dad who was a Dr that stole meds, was also prescribed oxy, and also shot heroin with me. All of this at 16 years old. I have never truly quit and I'll be 29 this year. 
I do truly need the pain medication now for multiple problems but with my rolerance so damn high oxy and dilaudid cant touch me. Even injecting .4 of heroin doesnt make me even get itchy forget tryin to nod

254^MrAtreus420^opiate^You'd be correct but if you're already an opiate addict it's somewhat nice. Saves a little money each month but with my tolerance it only lasts a few days if I'm trying to get high instead of just maintaining

254^MrAtreus420^opiate^Saving her wpuld be getting her clean but I appreciate the sentiment. She was already addicted when we met. I would never give an opiate naive person their first dose knowing what I know about opiates now. That's the equivalent of stabbing a man in every area of his body missing all vital organs and then having the girl stab him in the heart. Bad analogy but I think you get it

254^MrAtreus420^opiate^Here is what you really need to think about. Are you always going to be on some form of opiate for the rest of your life or not? If you are going to be the methadone will be far superior to the oxy. I'm prescribed 105 of the 30's every month but I was prescribed 100mg daily of methadone for quite some time. Methadone is more euphoric in my opinion and as for the pain problems methadone ,like you experienced, has a much longer half life meaning it will keep your pain away a lot longer than oxy at any dose. The real problem is the withdrawals. Withdrawals from methadone can last up to a month where as oxy lasts for around 7 days. I would try to figure out how much methadone he would put you on. If it isn't at least 50mg a day it probably isnt worth it but then again youre only getting 30 a day with the oxy. Maybe ask if you can try the methadone for a month and if it doesnt work for you switch back to oxy the next monthvor possibly take methadone as your main medication but get a few oxy a month for breakthrough pain

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
255^jamielives9^opiate^How would 20mg oxymorphone compare to 60mg oxycodone (an equivalent dose)? Are they pretty much the same high? I hear a lot of people say oxymorphone is the best opiate high there is.

Can you provide details to the differences? I‚Äôm very curious and doubt I‚Äôll ever get my hands on oxymorphone

255^jamielives9^opiates^I don‚Äôt get benzos w opiates, they always make me sleepier and I can‚Äôt appreciate the euphoria as much. Maybe I‚Äôm just getting the balance wrong, what‚Äôs a good ratio for oxy (snorted) and valium, with not much tolerance to either?

255^jamielives9^opiates^Ok sure, I‚Äôll just swallow. Never done it before, but I‚Äôm experienced with opiates and benzos - what kind of dose do you think I should try? I‚Äôve heard redosing half way through doesn‚Äôt work well with them, so it‚Äôs best to take all at the start. Shall I take one 300mg pill, or 2 (600mg)? Should I also try to have an empty stomach or does it not really matter?

255^jamielives9^opiates^Sadly I don‚Äôt. But yh I hear people say it‚Äôs better than actual heroin. Would love to see a tier list based on how nice opiates feel, rather than based on how strong they are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
256^tmac4ev^opiates^Well when I say ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù, it still feels very new to me. I feel like I was fucked up and doing opiates everyday just yesterday. I don‚Äôt feel the physical WD anymore, but the mental part lingers. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs PAWS, I‚Äôm just still learning how to live a normal life again. I haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúnormal‚Äù my entire adult life. It‚Äôs just a learning process I guess. It also takes time to build meaningful relationships again to entertain me. All my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were drug related and I obviously can‚Äôt associate with them anymore, you know? You‚Äôll get there. It DOES get better. There will be lingering issues for awhile but I can assure you that I‚Äôm THANKFUL AF that I‚Äôm better than the initial stages.

256^tmac4ev^opiates^No. If it helps you, then keep taking it. Weed won‚Äôt ruin your life. Personally, I was addicted to opiates for many years and I‚Äôve taken an array of different things to either help with WD, or just recreationally. I still consider myself sober because I don‚Äôt have a current addiction problem with anything I take. I think sobriety can mean whatever you want it to mean for you and your life. Not to mention you have a legit medical reason to be taking CBD.

256^tmac4ev^opiates^I think about this a lot. I‚Äôm 4 months sober and for at least the first month I wondered ‚Äúis this PAWS?‚Äù anytime I would feel down or anxious. If I sit and think about why I‚Äôm feeling the way I‚Äôm feeling, I can is usually come to a reason why I‚Äôm feeling the way I‚Äôm feeling other than it just being post withdraw. I know PAWS is a real thing, but I think a lot of people mistake their regular feelings coming back for the syndrome. You‚Äôve wasted or fucked up your life (to varying degrees)  while you were using. It will take a little bit to fix your finances, relationships, jobs, and not to mention your hormones. You‚Äôre still really early on, if you think you‚Äôre still having emotional/hormonal issues, go see a therapist or psychologist for someone to talk to at the very least who has no bias. It seems silly, but I‚Äôve been to a few sessions (not even regularly) and I do feel relieved afterwards. Life gets better the longer you stay off opiates. Yes, it gets boring and even I still haven‚Äôt found necessarily an appropriate coping mechanism yet, but I will. And you will too! Keep pushing through!

256^tmac4ev^opiates^I‚Äôve only ever taken pee tests for preemployment and I would do them the same day and still come up clean because oxys don‚Äôt fall under the two specific opiates they test for. Salvia tests I‚Äôm not sure about, but I know that oxys aren‚Äôt detectable after about 48-72 hours. You‚Äôll be good.

256^tmac4ev^opiates^Day 124 here off opiates. It DOES get better. I CT‚Äôd it off subs that I‚Äôd been trying to taper from (big mistake because I didn‚Äôt do it properly obviously and ultimately just delayed the hell for 24 days). I will say that the no sleeping part really had me at my breaking point there towards the end because it was barely improving for the first 2-3 weeks. I was just about to go get prescribed Ambien from the doctor and several people on here told me it gets better sleep-wise at day 21. I thought ‚Äúok yeah bullshit. No one is that precise.‚Äù Sure as shit the night of day 21 (so almost day 22) I slept like 5 or 6 hours rather than 1-3 hours of very light sleep. It slowly started to improve even more after that. It‚Äôs amazing how a lot of your symptoms will go away or at least lessen significantly once you start getting decent sleep. Other than that, I would give yourself one more week to start feeling 80% normal (but still probably sleeping like shit). You‚Äôre past the worst of it, keep going!!!!

256^tmac4ev^opiates^Personally, I would go see a specialist if you don‚Äôt improve in 2-3 weeks. I‚Äôm at 123 days sober from oxys and (while weird to talk about for me lol) my bowel movements didn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúnormal‚Äù until maybe around 100 days.  It wasn‚Äôt exactly diarrhea, but not that solid either. I don‚Äôt have pain associated with it though except for the initial WD stage. I had the same kind of pain you‚Äôre describing when I WAS on opiates. It felt like rocks were stuck in my intensives and just kept building up. If the CT scan cane back normal, that‚Äôs a good sign, but I don‚Äôt think you should still be having pain though. Thanksgiving has been awhile back by now.

257^AlchemicScript^china^You‚Äôre one bright bulb. If you are good at chemistry and you like it then go with it. Also you appear to know more about chemistry than most 14yr olds. My opinion, don‚Äôt sweat it, your friends dad probably only learned about chemistry as a burnt out sophomore in hs and then forgot it a year later. 

A more critical analysis of why you shouldn‚Äôt b scared

1. You are 14! Most parents, police officers, etc. don‚Äôt think of a 14yr olds as drug chemists. More likely they think that drug chemists are people who are college educated and have experience in their field. Additionally, since you are 14 charges won‚Äôt hit you that hard. It is way easier for prosecutors to portray a 27 yr old loner college student as some Walter white and lock him up to ‚Äúprotect the children‚Äù vs you an, in the eyes of most people, innocent looking teenager who think you aren‚Äôt a threat (how can a prosecutor say he is ‚Äúprotecting the children‚Äù if you are a child) but instead a bored kid looking for something to do. At best you‚Äôll get a ‚Äúdrugs are bad. Mmmkay.‚Äù and be let off the hook.

2. Analogues are hard as hell to prosecute. You can only be prosecuted under analog act if the analog is an analogue of a schedule I or Ii substance and is intended for human consumption. Your age will help bolster your defense (if you get caught) that it was a hobby and that you made analogues for fun not human consumption.

3. The fuzz will only bust low level chemists like you for 3 reasons:

- a. Your local police needs some action and arresting you gives them some leg room to convince people they‚Äôre still doing their job.

-b. You get lazy and make some major fuckups, to list a few...

B1 - you distribute your substance 
B2 - You accidentally buy too much sudafed or just don‚Äôt care about the CMEA
B3 - You sadly happen to be the only cooker in your area, justifying your arrest as a ‚Äòthreat to public safety‚Äô
B4 - You order a controlled precursor from a country that ain‚Äôt China without meeting the ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù requirement b.s and thereby guarantee getting monitored or at least flagged for future reference.
B5 - You let your loose lips sink your ship.

c. You want to be in the spotlight of the DEA and get on their radar

Listen to the wise advice of the Los Alamos scientists

What you see here
What you do here
What you hear here
When you leave here
Let it stay here.

TLDR don‚Äôt be dumb.

258^InevitableWrangler^opiates^If you buy pressed pills they are more likely to actually contain mdma rather than other amphetamines or stuff like benzofurans or cathinones than ever before. No one is putting fentanyl into coke or xanax on purpose. What happens is people are cutting heroin or pressing fake percs/oxycontin pills with fentanyl and then using the same table or pill press to make fake xans or other pills and that's where the contamination occurs. Real xanax doesn't feel like opiates and obviously coke and opiates have completely different effects, it's a common misconception that people are purposely adding fentanyl to drugs other than opiates. 

Also it's alot easier to find pure mdma in powder form than ever before as well.

259^poeticresonance^black^Time is working against him if he wants those black veil brides backstage passes (so ellen can suck off the whole band) i dont think these morons that throw money at him are gonna go for another fake charity scam

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
260^aabnormal20^china^Dude I'm even more wierded out by how nanchalant people are. Like they fully acknowledged that there was a disease in China and they went for Lunar New Year Break, it really fucks with me. Cause now whether we like it or not, we've all fucking got it. We just won't know for a few days. I'm not that healthy, I smoke too much, I don't need pneumonia-like symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
261^marxatemyacid^china^Lmao Chinese imperialism. That's nothing compared to 100 years of conflicts literally everywhere in the world. China hasn't been to war in decades while we haven't had more than 6 years of peace since the birth of the nation. Why would we car about nations revolting against capitalism unless it was directly in our interest to control them? I dont understand what's hard to understand about it. Countries opposing US global hegemony is not the same as having "global espionage"

261^marxatemyacid^black^How do we deal with the fact that because white people the majority of people in the US that revolutions with a base of PoC are going to be smaller than the largely reactionary white lumpenproletariat and petite bourgeois class. I think we need to be able to appeal to the most exploited whites as well but unfortunately a lot of movements like the black Panthers are misrepresented to white workers as "the Black KKK" and as a group they have no place in. I think we need to find a way to actually engage with the racism inherent in American society and engage the majority of the proletariat

261^marxatemyacid^china^Ah yes, hong kongs freedom to high rates of homelessness and renting literal cages. So much better than China

261^marxatemyacid^china^They are in favor of destroying private property though that cant happen as long as you like trade with western nations. I'm not sure where you've gotten this concept of destroying private life from but people still personally have their homes and belongings. China has always been a very different culture from the west and it's just hard to grasp from our point of view, fuck China is a similar size to the US and has 5x the population

261^marxatemyacid^china^Lol china has 30 percent renewable energy infrastructure. The us is around 13 and the Us military is still the largest polluter on earth by far

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
262^BenzedrineBlues^opiates^If I can't get high on opiates, I might as well turn myself in, if you catch my drift

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
263^rallyaly79^opiate^Get the capsules!! The stuff you have to mix into a liquid is soo hard to get down IMO. Anything with the ‚Äúred‚Äù is the best for opiate withdrawals. I can attest to the fact that it really does help with the physical symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
264^shedmane27^opiate^Sorry is PWD Precipitated Withdrawals ? I'm new here lol, surely my opiate tolernace would still be high from the 20mg methadone I was taking everyday, my last methadone dose was Thursday its Sunday now, I just took my first dose of Bupe tonight so I think I waited long enough. Just want to have no tolerance so I can use occasionally I was never a daily user anyway. Thanks again for your reply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
265^saadlilgrrl^black^NTA. Although using derogatory slurs towards black people is much worse in my opinion, I still believe that your boyfriend is being a straight up jerk and is acting like you don‚Äôt have any feelings towards his insults. We‚Äôre all human, and just because you‚Äôre white doesn‚Äôt give him the right to hurt your feelings. If it‚Äôs really hurting you I would have a serious talk with him because it‚Äôs not fair for him to expect to just take it whenever he feels like insulting you. You‚Äôre human too and sometimes words can hurt especially when he starts insulting your family.

265^saadlilgrrl^opiates^Meth, crack, heroin and hard opiates like dilaudid or opana is what you should avoid. The rest you listed cool in moderation. Coke is also ok in moderation if you do it socially. And ketamine is fun to do while taking MDMA. 

Make sure what your getting has been tested and from reliable sources. Don‚Äôt share straws or dollar bills with other people if anything is going up your nose. Have fun and be safe! :)

265^saadlilgrrl^dreams^I‚Äôm so sorry, this life is cruel. When my son Halo passed away from SIDS in September I would have dreams where I would be doing normal everyday stuff with him like breastfeeding, changing his diapers, and giving him baths. Waking up to those dreams in full blown tears knowing life just ripped it all away from my arms. I‚Äôm crying while typing this. I hope you heal through this. Hugs.

265^saadlilgrrl^china^I hear ya. Oxy makes me more happy. Dillies sometimes make me cranky but my plug doesn‚Äôt have any oxys or china rn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
266^BernieForWi^opiate^I don‚Äôt think 10 grams is much at all per day of kratom but 20 is a little much. Tbh I don‚Äôt feel much unless I dose about 6 grams of kratom at once and I will do that three times a day, but I am an opiate addict so maybe that‚Äôs why. This is what I use when I‚Äôm not in the middle of an opiate addiction I mean, which is on and off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
267^CronicNS^black^The N word and Pikey are completely different terminology‚Äôs. i dont care how they feel, they dont deserve my respect, and I‚Äôm sure they dont care about me either so theres no love lost. I wouldn‚Äôt racially abuse ANY black man because i know that even if he was being a dick, that most other black people are decent people. That cant be said with gippos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
268^lilpumppp^black^yup bro. if you look in my post history you‚Äôll see i posted one of these in there a while ago and everyone loved it lol. now everyone on there is so uptight about black market carts. 

i said fuck them fake carts is the new sub for me lol. thanks brotha, its very good man. Cheers back at ya

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
269^trammies^opiates^Im not sure man, i dont really know.

And yea SS is a scary shit dude, guess im not mixing opiates again, thanks for the answer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
270^WeekndJuice^opiates^Opiates like codeine aren‚Äôt very sedating in my experience so I‚Äôm very functional aka have superpowers.

Adderall or Vyvanse type of prescription drugs are pretty fictional in my opinion. 

Benzos NOT at zombie like doses are very functional imo to.

Don‚Äôt do meth :)

270^WeekndJuice^opiate^That‚Äôs because tramadol is a shitty ass opiate. Hardly an opiate and more of an SSRI. I‚Äôd just give up on those and try something stronger. 

Ask your doc:)

270^WeekndJuice^opiates^What to mix:
MDMA/Acid 
2-CB/Acid
Shrooms/Acid
Ketamine/Acid

I‚Äôve heard of opiates being cool but I don‚Äôt really know about that one.

No meth please

270^WeekndJuice^black^750 mg of TCH is a huge amount especially with no tolerance. The Xanax will keep the anxiety down but even at that dose I don‚Äôt honestly know. You‚Äôd most likely just black out and fall asleep. 

I‚Äôd do 50mg TCH and the Xanax but that‚Äôs just me

270^WeekndJuice^opiates^Xanax acts fast and strong but doesn‚Äôt last long. Start off with .5mg and see how you feel. If you suffer from anxiety or depression you‚Äôll feel it a lot more then someone who doesn‚Äôt. 

First time I tried benzos I didn‚Äôt think much of them but then I tried them again and wow. Honestly one of my favorite drugs but I‚Äôm careful with them. Or at least I think I am :/

Don‚Äôt mix with opiates or alcohol. Weed potentates it if you smoke.

270^WeekndJuice^opiate^Amitriptyline is not a benzodiazepines but rather a tricyclic antidepressant. It‚Äôs one of the first gen anti depressants and has less side effects then common SSRI and MAOI antidepressants or at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard. 

Withdrawal from amitriptyline is not nearly as bad as a benzodiazepine or opiate withdrawal. If you want to mitigate the withdrawal as much as possible tapering down would be a good choice.

Any withdrawal symptoms should not be that harsh especially if you taper down. 

Good luck

270^WeekndJuice^black^If you deal with any anxiety there a god send even at small doses. If you‚Äôre a pretty calm person it‚Äôll just make you more relaxed depending on the type you take.

Most that‚Äôll happen is you‚Äôll take enough to forget a week that you‚Äôve been benzed out and black out. Least that can happen is you get the best sleep you‚Äôve ever gotten.

Hope this helps!

270^WeekndJuice^opiate^Buy a Fent test kit. There so inexpensive but can save you‚Äôre life. Fent pressed pills are very dangerous and in my opinion are just never worth it. 

Fentanyl is one of the strongest opiates on the market and it is very easy to overdose on any Fent presses simply due to the fact we don‚Äôt know how much is in the pill itself and It being such a potent opiate. 

A Fentanyl high is much more euphoric and has more of a body high then you‚Äôll ever get from a Benzo in my experience. If the pill is Fent presses you‚Äôll get extremely high off that one bar and could start to nod. Pretty much you‚Äôll know you took Fent due to the intensity of the high.  

Take a quater if you can‚Äôt wait to play it safe (do not recommend) or order a test kit. Hope this helps!

270^WeekndJuice^opiates^MDMA or 2CB both mixed with weed are pretty awesome. I‚Äôd put acid down but sometimes the anxiety overcomes me and ruins if not diminishes the euphoria.

I‚Äôve never really found opiates like hydrocodone and oxy to be very euphoric by themselves but there‚Äôs still really enjoyable. That‚Äôs just me :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
271^ImProbablyHigh999^opiate^Lyrica and Gabapentin, especially when combined with benzos, are awesome for pain. 

I‚Äôve never taken them for pain, but they definitely feel VERY similar to an opiate, especially when mixed with benzos. 

Only differences from an opiate is that you‚Äôll get the munchies and you won‚Äôt itch

271^ImProbablyHigh999^black^I black out when I smoke on kpins honestly. Like my friends say I act normal and everything but I have ABSOLUTELY no recollection of the night. It bugs me out lmaooo

271^ImProbablyHigh999^dreams^I just took 6mg to help me sleep. Fuck. 

No In all seriousness, I don‚Äôt notice a difference in my dreams other than I can usually remember them better for a few hours after waking up. Never have had crazy dreams like this in all of my life, but on melatonin I definitely can recall things easier. 

Also, I‚Äôve literally never had a nightmare in all my 20 years of living. Is that normal?

271^ImProbablyHigh999^opiate^I felt pretty drunk and I kept ‚Äúnodding‚Äù. Not similar to opiate nods, but I would find myself staring into space. Everything kinda started vibrating too. I could drive though and I was super talkative. It felt like MDMA. I kept having to take deep breaths because my whole body felt so good. Like I was getting a full massage. I definitely feel like I could up the dose I was just wondering if 750mg was a dangerous dose of lyrica

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
272^747Latts^opiates^I‚Äôve taken 130 mgs many times with no issue, but I don‚Äôt combine, it‚Äôs benzos only and 1 benzo at a time. No weed, alch, opiates or anything. 
Benzos alone are actually very hard to OD on, it‚Äôs when you mix them with other stuff , then you‚Äôre in rough waters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
273^Giraffe_Balls^opiates^I was thinking of coming up of a plan of rotating between drug cycles so I wont become dependant to one. For example one month I'll use benzos once or twice a week, the next month will be opiates once or twice a week, next month phenibut/nootroopic, ect

What do you think of this? Sounds smart and risky at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
274^throwaya1004563^black^Yeah took. Back in the daywhem i was reaaly into benzos id easily eat whole 100pcs package until  black outed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
275^spdrv89^black^Same. My fav is the FIB black suburban. I go around map following people with 4 stars and try to get one undamaged. Then I drive around like a cop just getting off work. I get food, wash the truck, get new workout clothes then go play tennis. Get a call that makes me mad go home get shitfaced drunk while hitting the bong counting all the weed arrests I made that day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
276^fkedup123^dreams^Yeah its just you know, when i redose phenibut (which i do rarely) on the same day. I often get some wierd side effects the following days after, i dont think my body can handle it much. But it was an important day. However, the first 1 day after i dont feel much, but at the 3-4 day mark, i get paralyzed whenever i sleep, and i have super vivid dreams and a very heavy feeling in my head. However i now take some vitamins and magnesium that helps removing that feeling.

&#x200B;

Just still a bit worried it could have any effects to the operation or if im just too paranoid.. Thanks for the answer bro anyways

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
277^yerknowitzki^opiate^not sure who you seem to be getting into arguments with but most everyone i‚Äôve met on here is really chill and understanding. that‚Äôs half the reason i come to this sub is because it‚Äôs the one place i‚Äôm able to talk to people and actually don‚Äôt feel judged. almost all of us have done fucked up and regretful things that come with being an opiate users. 

you shouldn‚Äôt let them get to you man. just disregard their comments and keep it moving. just like most things in life, there is always going to be a few bad apples. i‚Äôm sure i can speak for the majority and say that we‚Äôre here for you and aren‚Äôt ones to judge. just keep your head up man. the lot of us are very understanding. hope you have a good day bropiate. ü§ôüèº

277^yerknowitzki^dreams^i‚Äôm on day 8 right now. pretty much past the physical WD symptoms as well. can‚Äôt really sleep well at night but, like you, every time i do sleep, i have dreams about grabbing or snorting some 30s and then wake up super bummed. the urges to use again aren‚Äôt that bad until night time when i‚Äôm trying to go to sleep but i can think about is ‚Äúdamn, if i had some 30s right now i could knock right out. unfortunately(or fortunately)  for me, i‚Äôve been broke and don‚Äôt have money to grab even if i wanted to. hopefully this shit gets easier but man i don‚Äôt know how people do it. i‚Äôve had a little bit of weed to hold me over but i‚Äôm at the point i need something to fill the void. i‚Äôve drank maybe 4-5 times in the last 2 years but the past 2 days i‚Äôve been drinking just to not go insane. 

hope you can keep up the clean streak homie. keep your head up and stay strong

i fuck w your name btw. fent 30s were my go to these last 7-8 months

277^yerknowitzki^opiate^lol not that many honestly. way more of an opiate guy myself. one of my buddies i used to get high with would occasionally have xanax and would snort them so naturally that‚Äôs what i was doing as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
278^murzfurlz^incense^Yeah you're gonna want to at least open your window and maybe use a fan? If they are cool with you burning incense and shit you could do that too.

278^murzfurlz^opiate^If you don't have any opiate tolerance i really would only take the 15 mg..not mix with codeine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
279^DigitalGho5t^opiates^Good to hear. Yes my wife also takes a higher does of Kratom than me. I seem to be overly sensitive to most things, aside from opiates. It‚Äôs been a challenge cutting back because we both work full time and are always busy on weekends. Hopefully once we have a chance we can both take a week off to acclimate to lower doses or switching to Kratom entirely.

280^xaniel_the_legend^opioid^Every doctor that googled it was like ‚ÄúOPIOID BAD!‚Äù and treated me like I was slamming heroin every day. They immediately put me in drug counseling while in inpatient (I was in for depression and my kratom use was pretty mild at the time) and the people there were all heavy meth users and decade long alcoholics while I had a mild-moderate soft drug habit. When they asked all of us what our drug of choice was I said ‚Äúalcohol and opioids‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt want to sound like a dick and say ‚ÄúI take 7 grams of kratom like 4-5 times a week,‚Äù (my usage at the time). I saw the main doctor the next day and I told her about my drug use and pulled me out of the drug counseling. She said to watch my use with the kratom because of the WD symptoms but other than that my drug use was mild and typical of someone my age. I really should have listened to her tbh because now my habit is really bad.

280^xaniel_the_legend^opioid^I am one of the unlucky ones I guess. The withdrawal didn‚Äôt start until like 18-20 hours sober but it was bad. Typical physical opioid WD symptoms (not as bad). However the mental was horrible. I got pretty bad paranoia, depression and some mild delusions. It felt like everyone was plotting against me. I also kept forgetting where my car was for some reason which gave me panic attacks. It was parked where it normally is. I ended up taking 5 grams at 3 am last night because I was losing my mind. Physical WD was bad today so I took 2.5 grams when I woke up. Just going to taper more and jump off at like 5-7 gpd.

280^xaniel_the_legend^chocolate^Potency varies. Last time I did them I took 1.3 and it was tied for my strongest trip. The other was a 2 gram chocolate. Both experiences were stronger than my largest weighted dose (4.5 grams). If you take 3.5 you will have a strong trip almost guaranteed. If you haven‚Äôt done psychs before maybe start with 1.75. You can always take more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
281^BigTird^opiates^If your not trying g to make this an everyday habit You‚Äôd need to skip at least 3 days in between highs to keep from making your self dope sick. 
For me when I use opiates 2-3 plus days in a row- I‚Äôm already hooked and will be sick when I come down.

281^BigTird^opiate^Yea when you dose high on tia, you get a hella opiate buzz. 
I took the sub about 24 hours later and still had some pwd. It‚Äôs been 3 days now no tia with 8mg sub 2x day and I‚Äôm still not at 100%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
284^BigBucs731^opiates^If you know how to take them it's a great high? And they potentiate or synergize with benzos and opiates.

It's all about staggered doses and how you take them. Look it up. I've had some of the best highs of my life of gaba..

284^BigBucs731^opiate^Crack.. No desire
Coke.. Unless it's free.
Heroin.. Did once and former opiate addict.

PCP.. no reason
Ketamine... Went into k hole only time

Any of that synthetic shit. K2, spice, bath salts, etc.. I do real drugs.

284^BigBucs731^opiate^Thank you. I'm by no means perfect. I will still go off the rails evry now and again. Went hard this weekend in fact. It is a very slippery slope. It's easy to fuck everything up. I was never even a stim user until a year ago.

For 18 years I was a raging alcoholic and opiate addict. That shit ruined my 20s aand 30s and almost killed me multiple times, cost me multiple great jobs, a few trips to jail and one medically induced coma so I didn't die from alcohol withdrawal. I'm over 2 Years sober from booze and actually beat opiate dependance by using stims.  I've never been to jail, the hospital or lost a job because of responsible use of stims and taking my prescribed benzos as directed.

284^BigBucs731^opiates^Benzos or opiates but that's the start of potential disaster.

Try a red or green strain of kratom. Works great for me since I no longer drink and can't smoke weed.

284^BigBucs731^opiate^How is use Gabapentin recreationally.
THIS IS MY METHOD AND DOSAGE. USE CAREFULLY AS I'M A WELL SEASONED DRUG USER WITH A MONSTER TOLERANCE.

The biggest factor is staggering the doses. Your body will absorb only so much Gaba at once, usually 600mg give or take. So whether you take 600mg or 3000mg at once you'll only get 600mg..

Take 2 Aleve 45 minutes before 1st dose.

1st dose take 300-600mg with a caffeinated soda.

30 minutes later take 300mg and repeat every 30 minutes until you hit desired dose. Mine is usually 1800-2100mg.. Always take with soda and I've found drinking coffee in between also helps. Also eat a fatty snack, it helps absorbrion. 

Also, gabapentin will take 2-3 hours before full effects kick in and it will cause balance issues. Be careful standing up..

The effects I get are increased energy, awesome mood lift that makes me very social. It relieves my anxiety makes music sound like it's coming from speakers sent from angels.. It's also great for nerve pain. I'd compare the high to a mild dose of ecstasy without the extreme euphoria. It's like part benzo part opiod and part Adderall. 

Now gabapentin also has another phenomenal characteristic. It synergizes with benzos and potentiates opiates.

Synergy with benzos amplifies the effects of both drugs as one works on one gaba receptor and vice versa. Essentially it makes both stronger.

Opiate effects are potentiated, or made stronger when gabapentin is taken before hand..

I've used both combos and can say it's the best combination of anything I've ever tried.

And finally, for stimulant users gabapentin is also useful. Not only does it aid the comedown, it also provides a unique high while helping bring you down.

That's the big secret about gabapentin. When I hear people say "I took 3000mg and it didn't do shit" I just shake my head... STAGGER THE DOSES... 300MG*EVERY 30 MINUTES UNTIL YOU HIT YOUR SWEET SPOT.

WARNING:

You can only do this 1 or 2 times a week max and not in a row. Tolerance to this drug builds in DAYS.

Also, it does not affect everyone the same. Some not at all. If you have a low drug tolerance I wouldn't start with no more than 900mg and adjust til you find your sweet spot. Be safe people.

284^BigBucs731^opiates^Not really for opiates at all. If I'm lucky I'll get a mild initial rush that we all know and love, but it fades quickly. I was also a daily kratom user for 6 months and that increased my tolerance even higher. A while back a buddy gave me 3 oxy 15s. I'd already taken morning dose of kratom so I hung on to them until the following evening and didn't take any kratom for about 36 hours. Took all 3 after work that night and it felt like one 10mg perc. No rush, no euphoria and barely any high. It's like I have a permanent tolerance so I just don't seek them out.

284^BigBucs731^opiate^I have an insane opiate tolerance and don't take them anymore because I just don't get a rush anymore and barely feel them. And due to the ridiculous price and worrying about fent pressed shit.

I was freaking amazed at how hard and how long 2mg lasted. Even while throwing up for 12 hours I was still high.. And it has a visual trippy effect on me, especially closed eye visuals. I took 1mg Xanax and snorted another 1/8 about 3 hours ago and I seem higher now than I did an hour ago. About to take the other 1mg of Xanax and drift of to never never land

284^BigBucs731^opiate^Everyone else does for opiate WD, but everybody is different. I found reds least effective. I like green. If you can find it OPMS Silver Malay Special Reserve capsules are the closest opiate feel for me.. With your tolerance, which is like mine I would start with 12 capsules.

I get the best results from 12-16 caps. Will take about an hour and is subtle. It's not gonna get you high, but it will put a dent in withdrawal symptoms

284^BigBucs731^opiate^I believe it has to do with the Gaba receptors. Alcohol withdrawal is nearly identical to benzos because it acts on the same receptor. That's why benzos are used to medically detox someone safely from alcohol. At 26, I almost died from alcohol withdrawal. I went into full blown delirium tremons and had to be put in a medically induced coma for 4 days to save my life. I was a raging alcoholic, power drinker for 18 years and have been medically detoxed 3 times since then. Either klonopin or lorazepam was used everytime. Thankfully I'm 26 months sober now.

Same with gabapemtin, it is very good for benzo withdrawal but has a nasty WD of its own.

And as a former opiate addict I can although miserable won't kill you. Alcohol was 10x worse than opiates in terms of WD. I went through mild benzo withdrawal, but I was on 3mg Kpin for only 4 months and was quick tapered by a Dr. It still was bad and felt just like alcohol WD to me.

Also, suboxone and methadone also come with a terrible withdrawal and require a taper as well. So opiate addicts aren't getting a free pass, they are just using an alternative to delay the inevitable.

284^BigBucs731^opiate^Of course not. I actually got sick a while ago but ate some lunch and the buzz is still going. I did not expect the trippy like visuals, especially the closed eye ones. I'm starting to get real sleepy too. This stuff is powerfuk with legs. Like I said I have a monster opiate tolerance and it's been years since I've caught a nod, but I'm 8 hours in and the high is still hitting good.

284^BigBucs731^opiate^Oh I'm a former opiate addict with an insane tolerance. It would take 90mg of Oxy just to maintain. But I haven't had any opiod in months

285^katiecharm^toys^Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all.  
  
When I trip on a hard edible, I can literally feel my pattern recognition disrupted - so patterns that I already know as familiar seem novel, old pattens in memory become worth pondering again, and new pattern combinations become possible.  
  
Obviously the word ‚Äòpattern‚Äô here is incredibly abstract - everything from memes, to childhood toys, to relationships.  We are pattern recognition machines and situation outcome simulators - that‚Äôs our two main functions.

285^katiecharm^hocus^The idea that anyone tries to wrap their very real existence around the fanciful make-believe of Christianity just seems so silly to me.  
  
It‚Äôs a book filled with so much clear and obvious hatred, borne of humanity just coming into a greater sentience and being apprehensive about what it all meant... and so they did the best they could to explain how life worked - with a bunch of made up hocus pocus mixed with a giant dose of tyrannical patriarchy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
286^lightupsquirtle^gum^1. I would highly recommend buying a scale to do this but in the case where you refuse to do so:
2. Evenly split up your stash. If you have 1g for example, split it in 2 so you have 2 approximately .5g piles. Then break one of them down into 2 .25 piles. Then break one of those into two .125 g piles. One of those piles should be a good dose (or even slightly less, you should aim for 100 mg). This is the best way to estimate without a scale (in my experience). 
I bought capsules off of amazon and filled them myself, but you can also just toss those crystals in the back of your throat and wash it down with water (tastes god awful so be prepared).
For the roll itself: have gum for the gurning (jaw cleaning and teeth grinding). Stay hydrated. Love the world :) happy roll

286^lightupsquirtle^gum^Have gum. And vicks to clear up all your sinuses and enhance the roll. I always love mint vapes as well. 

The most important thing is HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE AROUND YOU sharing a roll with good people is the best magic no lie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
287^John3190^black^My first time I a .5 followed by .25 2 hours later and it was awesome. Straight euphoria no black out. That changed after exceeding 1mg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
288^P47r1ck-^black^Sucks that I have to agree with a white guy pretending to be black lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
289^arkl2020^opiates^Oh I never said that parent isn‚Äôt prob crazy, but she‚Äôs prob just in denial. When I first told my parents I was doing heroin (my mom found me passed out with powder on a mirror in front of me) she still didn‚Äôt believe it. And the ‚Äúfault‚Äù of an OD can mean different things to different people, 99.9% of users aren‚Äôt trying to OD. They also could have got fentanyl or something they weren‚Äôt trying to get that was a lot more potent. Who knows how she was thinking when she said that.

I would say my parents enabled me to use for a long time, which is probably why I wasn‚Äôt homeless on the streets (at least not for that long) and doomed forever.

In the UK they have heroin maintenance programs where you go and get pharmaceutical heroin daily, and those people have the biggest chance of getting clean after getting their life together. After you get addicted, opiates are no longer fun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
290^Addictionandsoforth^dreams^Yes lucid dreams are passive, what one can do in a lucid dream can be manipulated by the persons mind but the process of sleeping is passive and out of the individuals control like the functioning of organs ect... I simply don‚Äôt believe that claim I would love to see the source of an individual learning to play an instrument from dreaming. Critical thinking is simply analysing a specific theme, subject, source or object and making a particular judgement about said thing based upon our assumptions/ education ect... I fail to see and have never seen it proven that taking this drug gives you those skills, if anything it simply convinces the users of having possessed some new skill set with no evidence that they do. ‚ÄúLSD sets the brain up to learn things in a similar way to children‚Äù says who??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
291^lemondrugs11^opiate^Ah shoot I had posted after taking orally already. But yeah I‚Äôm finishing a joint from earlier too so hopefully I feel good cuz I‚Äôm sore as hell lol opiate addiction scares me so I probably won‚Äôt do this again for awhile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
292^Mrsjtkirk^auntie^Totally agree. My best friend and I are dating two brothers and she has kids with hers. She couldn't make it to Christmas dinner cause of work and I had to listen to the in-laws pissing and moaning about what a terrible mom she is, because who was gonna take care of those poor neglected kids for one whole day? Not like their dad, auntie and uncles and grandparents were all there. How dare she work so that she can provide a better future for her kids.

292^Mrsjtkirk^dreams^Well don't keep her in the dark. It's your job as a parent to help her realize her dreams :). And if there are five year olds that can say "paleontologist," your daughter can say "proctologist."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
293^perc30princess^china^Its just the world we live in fam china banned alprazolam to the us so they just send tons of flualprazolam instead. Its not really that bad just start small. I have a handful of 3 mg flualprazolam bars and 1/4 knocks me out for 12 hours lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
294^Decius1954^opiates^What kind of effects should I expect from this kind of combination? Also do opiates by any chance dull the roll? I doubt they do but im just wondering

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
295^nearmusicbeats^china^I never use ems or fedex always china post and ems but the company estimate is still ¬£30 odd for shipping. Never bought from taobao before but I‚Äôve used aliexpress and dhgate in the past. I was hoping it would be as easy as that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
296^scvm-lord^opiates^I‚Äôve heard of it potentiating shit maybe benzos/ gaba maybe it was opiates/ opioids or something

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
297^Mango2439^dreams^Dont test yourself.. My dad suffers from seziures when he goes on alcohol withdrawal... But yet he will still drink for weeks... To just put it down and power through the withdrawal.. Im scared for my life whenever i smell alcohol on him.. I dont want to lose my father... Dont put your life at risk just to see if you are "strong" enough... A seziure will kill even the biggest man... I know you have family..

And if one day you had a seizure in your dreams and died, and a little self care or precaution could have prevented it... Your family would be devastated.. If the withdrawal gets too hard.. Or you start shaking too much.. Please dont think you wont die like "the others." Your life is as fragile as everyone elses.. Just be safe.. I couldnt bare scroll past this without letting you know the dangers of your decicion. Just look up a benzo taper if it gets too hard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
298^RorschachSwe^chocolate^At work I try to break the ice all the time so the other person wont feel the akward space.

A couple days ago I was trying to explain something starting with M. It got like this: Mmmmmm-mmmm-Marabou. And everyone went laughing to tears üòÇ Obvs Marabou wasnt the word I was looking for but I took my chance and broke some ice.

Those of you not familiar with Marabou Its a scandinavian chocolate company with ads always sound like Mmmmm-Marabou!

300^operation-casserole^black^Make this black and white, and I was in a place nearly identical for this for a good while on 200ug

300^operation-casserole^dreams^Not to be the cliche redditor telling you not to be with her but yikes, don't simp over this girl my king! Granted she isn't having sex with the other guy while you are in a committed relationship, but you are damn near close to being cucked.

Let's get the facts straight. You fluked, should have had that girl crash on the couch, it's fair your girl decided to break up but in my eyes..... that's a little too quick to judge. Seems very fragile and light situation that any real connected couple wouldn't be petty over and could be resolved quickly (especially if you didn't do anything!).

Two, your girl got with another dude while you were broke up, fair. Not your business, as much as you love her.

Three, she's fucking another dude like right in the middle of you two working out your relationship... yikes! You did nothing, now she is practically cucking you, don't be submissive here you have feelings and worth as well! That shit sucks.

What I'd say is that as much as you love this girl, clean break. For now. To be fair having multiple relationships does build character and awareness in people, and it really isn't within your right to deny her that opportunity. And yes some couples do eventually after the dust settles come back together for the long run and love each other. But right now you're young, haven't even *gone to college* yet, and you are worried?? So much life ahead of you my guy. We've all been there, and it sucks, but you gotta drop the feelings right now for the time being.

Bottom line, she's playing you right now. Idk about you but I don't fuck with that shit. Stand your ground!

I broke up with my girl of 2.5 years, longest relationship I ever had, and yeah she comes back to me in my dreams sometimes but I knew she wasn't the one forever. We haven't talked once since the breakup and I knew it hit her hard, but we were and still are very young. Very rarely do both partners mutually agree about a breakup. One person gets the short end of the stick and that's life, in this case you got the short end and you have to deal with that.

Are you going to simp over her? Or are you going to let the dust settle, reflect, get back to focusing on *YOU*, and deciding on things later?

300^operation-casserole^dreams^Hmm, I have had vast experiences in the dream dept, but the only thing is that there is no real knowledge about it's workings anyway. Especially not enough to really "give advice".

I haven't had a nightmare in as long as I can remember, but I got them frequently if not exclusively when I was younger. I'm 19M now, and over the past year alongside experimenting with substances I have practiced audio assisted meditation and have gotten into very lucid and vivid dreams regularly for month spans of time.

It's kind of hard to really "teach" but honestly speaking, you are your dream world, and ultimately you have control whether you realize it or not. I think the coolest thing that ever happened to me in terms of nightmares was one night when I was meditating (which for me is laying on my back on my bed, palms up, and zenning out and practicing non-action but at most focusing on the breathe) and I was confronted with a handful a fears and scary entities. Instead of fearing them, I asked them why they were scaring me. The response was to prepare me. I said I was prepared, and I didn't need them anymore. They went away after that.

301^CivilizedInsanity^dreams^Sorry,  I just can't get jiggy with this shit... I don't get it
Music. Especially rap,  has changed a lot... I'm not even sure this would be considered rap... 

I'm old now,  maybe this is what the newest hot shit sounds like.... But you just came of as angry and able to some
ehat rhyme,  I didn't get anything musical from this but I encourage you to pursue your dreams

301^CivilizedInsanity^opium^Because the title mentions opium... False advertising lol

Its similar to if you said you didn't shoot dooe,  but posted a pic of dope with a needle and spoon

BTH is NOT opium... Simple as that

Enjoy it though.. Happy nods... Looks like the shit we had in my area last year,  good dope but the plug was a pain in the ass at times

301^CivilizedInsanity^china^He did owe me a favor,  but I wasn't expecting to get hooked up THAT fat....dudes always been straight w me and swears this stuff isn't fent.... He's turned me away before when he did have dope that had fent in it,  always said it was bad for bizness, etc.... So I'm inclined to believe him when he says this is just straight up China white

There are always 100+ " but what if ? " scenarios with the dope game...but I'm thinking he hooked me up wit some pure product and is being straight

I've never had China white before,  nor do we have to deal wit fentadope bags as this is a BTH region.  

I'm just going to enjoy the last bit of it....dirt cheap potent product,  and real deal China could be possible... Shit I can barely get 2 g's of tar for 100... Let alone some rocked up "China"

301^CivilizedInsanity^black^You could take a raw chunk of that,  crush it into powder, and gently snort that into your nasal passages... And that is what the air in heaven tastes like....in junkie heaven. There are small cauldrons that line the halls and each one is bubbling oh so gently,  as the small fire underneath it keeps the perfect temperature to vaporize the chunks of gunpowder heroin.....a man with a wheelbarrow comes around and stokes the fire while adding more heroin as needed to keep the air filled with vaporized dope

BUT WAIT.... THIS IS HEAVEN right? ,  why are they settling for black tar and not something purer? 

You must first understand the map of the afterlife... Even Heaven has a West Siiiiiide..its plush as Beverly Hills, it's as hood as LA...and there's even a skid row,  because to some,  that IS heaven..  

I'll see y'all there one day.... Because G'z DO get to go to heaven

We have something like almost half a gram of pure carfentanil and I need to eye ball doses for 3 people,  1, snorts,  I boofs and one will bang it with a diabetic needle, (first time shooting) 

I assume I need to dose small,  I can see the grains and will take a few grains and crush them on black paper so I can see it ok... And then I will split that into 3 piles and let everyone pick their dose... I know this stuff is strong so I don't want to mess up... I've got a bunch of crystal on hand to n case someone falls out (do you have to filter 
or use a cotton with crystal when u shoot it? 

And you can't die from carfent in the air or by touching it.... Wrong realized the bag was open and on the table and no one is dead,  I even picked crystals out of the bag wit no glove and I ain't dead üíÄ 

Does this plan sound like it will work?  We've all wanted to try this stuff for hella long ever since we saw it on erowid and TOTSE

302^guacatmole^opiate^ Criss cross apple sauce is how it's called in the US and taught to kids... This position is actually best for your posture, sitting without a chair.

You wont end up as the next example if you don't fall asleep in that position for days... Otherwise it's perfectly fine, any other position **shocker** will do the same thing if you ain't moving for days... Standing too, or even just lying down.

Look up pressure sores.

This story really teaches no lesson other than what the past 10k "benzos fucked me up for good" stories have preached, stop slamming so many benzos down your gullet to where you pass out for 4 days... The dude in the story is lucky he fucked with benzos and not an opiate..

302^guacatmole^opiates^Still another less of the drug, more of poor harm reduction by the user and people around him story. Glad he's okay.  But sitting bedrest or in bad positions for a while on any drug, sober or not, not moving or adjusting positions will cause this exact thing. Pressure sores are no joke and actually kill elderly people.

If his asshole friend would've at least intervened, had him preferably in a hospital where they'd wake him up, or stayed with him putting him in a recovery position making sure blood flow isn't cut off... He would be walking just fine today...

I just have to say this whenever I see people react to these posts by blaming the substance and getting scared, the "dumping all benzos" comments. When none of these diagnosis are directly from the substance it self... Use some harm reduction and some brains using these substances and don't end up in a 4 day coma.

Huh, I just mentioned using drugs responsibly if you want to stay healthy? Crazy... Who would've thought that.


tl;dr: OP of the story is damn lucky with his irresponsibility of usage, he learned his lesson with benzos and not opiates gets to breath another day. Don't irresponsibly use hardcore drugs...

302^guacatmole^opiates^Not op... But I've heard of certain people actually being able to "mute" their withdrawals from opiates, even gabaergics with their stim use.

302^guacatmole^dreams^I'm not sure if I was the only one who noticed this, but G can be quite hallucinogenic at the peak. I recommend trying to close your eyes, turn off the light and put on some energeful music.

They were like waking dreams, it took me many places when I used G.

303^WhoFedZed^chocolate^Nitrous Oxide - Non stop laughter, sedation, and vision distorted in a weird way.

MDMA - Become your worst enemy's best friend, euphoria comparable to someone injecting warm chocolate fudge into your blood stream, and everything just seems right. 

LSD - Depending on the dosage, but I'll talk of my 444ug trip, a little bit of a mindfuck, visuals up the ass, and very deep and intense thoughts. 

Weed - Discover how much you can truly eat, and just relax and listen to some music. 

Xanax (and other benzos) - Sleepy, forget half of the shit you do. 

&#x200B;

Good luck on your test!

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiates^Before opiates, listening to music was my favourite thing to do.


Now it's listening to music while high ;)

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiate^For something with such a dirty reputation, the feeling that an opiate provides is sooo pure and blissful. Opiates provide to humans everything one could seek for the a limited period of time. And there's no comedown!

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiates^2 months ago. My mom had tooth surgery and received some 5mg Percs, but didn't take them cuz she doesn't like opiates. I think, "I heard those can get you high!" so I steal a couple. I make my first post on this sub, everyone tells me "They're amazing but don't do them", I think "They can't be THAT good" so I take 10mg and kind of expect to be disappointed tbh.


But that first high, man, it was fucking incredible. I never expected it to feel THAT good. I didn't even know it was possible. I spent my entire afternoon and evening basking in so much fuzzy euphoria I was overwhelmed. It was perfection.

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiates^Man if my best friend found this account and knew I did opiates he would be so disappointed... Hell even if it was just weed he'd probably judge me. Let alone opiates.

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opioid^> If you've taken opioid medications for more than two weeks, you may need to stop using these medications as soon as possible to prevent serious consequences. Common signs that it's time to get off opioids include serious side effects, reduced pain relief from the same dose of medications over time (tolerance), or behaviors that raise concerns about misuse, abuse or addiction.

> Don't try to go cold turkey on your own. Opioid withdrawal can be dangerous, and symptoms can be severe. When it's time for you to stop taking opioids, ask for your doctor's help to develop a medication withdrawal plan (called a taper) that gradually reduces the amount of medication you take. Depending on the type and dose of the drug you've been taking and how long you've been taking the drug, it may take weeks or even months to gradually and safely reduce your dose and get off your opioid medication.


Seems pretty clear to me...

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiates^I mean if opiates didn't exist, abstaining from them would be a much easier choice to make lmao. So I'd probably remove them from existence.

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiate^The worst part is that he knows I have 3 reddit accounts and always asks me "why do you need a third account lol?" and I'm like, if you only knew...


I like to think that if he found out, I'd stop to preserve our friendship. But god, the opiate high is so blissful, I'm not sure how long I'd be able to abstain.

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiates^It's so weird how to me how humans are so predictable. I've read so many stories about how people ruin their lives due to opiates and yet I still want to take them... shit's powerful, man.

304^ImAZuckerForYou^opiate^There must be a way to genetically modify humans not to build tolerance. The opiate use could be endless!

308^nojewsallowed69^opioid^It's impossible, you die by causing your body harm. The one thing I could maybe think is opioid overdose.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
309^satiivaaaa^black^edibles hit wayyy stronger. it‚Äôll take longer to hit though. the quickest an edible has ever hit for me is 10 minutes and the longest two hours. if you‚Äôre impatient just set a timer for 45 minutes and go do something else, it‚Äôll probably hit before then and you‚Äôll forget about the timer.(that‚Äôs what i do.) in my opinion i prefer edibles cause they hit stronger, give my whole body a veryyyy strong tingling feeling,and it‚Äôs a better high. (to each it‚Äôs own though, everyone‚Äôs experience is different, i‚Äôm just speaking from my own pov.) and it‚Äôll leave me stuck for hours. it‚Äôs very intense. sometimes i can‚Äôt even move, i just lay there stuck high as hell with thoughts running through my mind and the music elevating me. if you eat the edible on an empty stomach it‚Äôll hit harder cause the thc is the first thing your stomach is absorbing. it‚Äôs not a stupid question, everybody has questions. don‚Äôt eat too much. take a small piece and wait a bit, then if you‚Äôre not feeling it enough take a little bit more. the thing with edibles is that you can‚Äôt really control how high you get. with smoking, if you feel like you‚Äôre high enough, you just stop smoking. with edibles it‚Äôs a gamble. especially for homemade edibles, cause one piece could be more concentrated then the other. but nonetheless, have fun. edibles can be intense. especially if you eat the whole thing. but if you‚Äôre in the right environment with the right music you‚Äôll be fine. if it gets too intense; sniff some black pepper.

311^CantTouchThisCat^chocolate^Lol go mix with in soda or with a chocolate milk with high fructose. You‚Äôll see It clumps and gets disgusting. If you want to drink chunky chocolate milk that‚Äôs on you. I‚Äôm referring to mixing with a spoon not everyone has a blender on the go.

311^CantTouchThisCat^chocolate^My main way of dosing don‚Äôt be sleeping on chocolate milk. Make sure there‚Äôs no high fructose or it will clump!!! Make sure it‚Äôs liquid sugar or cane sugar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
312^SnortyMcSnortFace^opiates^Well I sure do miss the feeling and rush, but it‚Äôs just not sustainable for most people. If you want to be high all day everyday, go for it man. I‚Äôm just here to put in my two cents to try and show you the bigger picture. If I could be high all day everyday with no money issues or risk of infection or OD or any of the serious risks with using heroin I‚Äôd be a junkie again. 
I‚Äôm 42 days clean as of today and don‚Äôt miss waking up in withdrawals, having to dose multiple times a day, using in the bathroom at family or guests houses. I will admit I‚Äôll probably use in the next few months, but not to the degree I did before. If you‚Äôre talking about doing heroin or opiates everyday, it‚Äôs just a horrible life when you can‚Äôt get your fix. If you wanna use once in a while it‚Äôs doable if you have good self control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
313^FibonCarbor^opiate^As someone who has dealt with benzo and opiate addictions, I‚Äôm not too concerned with my nicotine, especially since I‚Äôm not out of breath anymore since I switched to vaping.

313^FibonCarbor^opiate^You shouldn‚Äôt wait until after ingesting things to ask if it‚Äôs safe.

Oxy and Kratom combo is the worst. It actually blocks opiate receptors making it less euphoric that the opiate alone IMO. Everything else is semi okay in low doses... but mixing Gabapentin and oxy can lead to greater respiratory depression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
314^KemWiz^opiates^Better quit while you're ahead. 

Take a week off, dont get more, valium is fine but dont let it change your mind. Valium is probably worse of an addiction than opiates tho.

314^KemWiz^opioid^Other opioids have other metabolites, as well as producing a lot of morphine. 

I'm allergic to codeine but I can do any other opioid, morphine, and heroin. I'll die if I take enough codeine.

314^KemWiz^opiate^Now which one of you have dealt with real strong opiate withdrawal?

I've dealt with opiate and benzo wd at the same time, many times, I went to rehab for it after many years of trying to control it and quit.

Kratom wd is there, and its shitty, but morphine wd is quite a lot worse, kratom wd has limits kinda, with opiates it feel like death

314^KemWiz^black^I use to snort anything, now I really dont like it, especially when I snorted black tar vinegar bs lol that bth straight fucks your sinuses up, I got a weak meningitis virus from it but it still was such a terrible illness I missed work for it n got hydros from my doc for it when I just needed a doctors note lol

I'll snort some roxys or high quality #4 heroin but no coke, I dont care for it anyway... but my nose gets fucked up too easy now a days, and I sometimes get sick a few days after from it.

Plus, my buddy almost died, and had to have 2 or 3 brain surgeries to remove infected tissue from his brain.. theres just so much bad with snorting.. you can even tell when someone has been snorting stuff by how inflamed their face and nose are sometimes, that's pressure in your face which isnt healthy...

314^KemWiz^opiates^For the most part. They can make me a little moody but I try not to feed into that, opiates are the one thing I can do and can completely hide it if I want, and I do from many. 

Something I've always said, was that heroin has a lot of character...

Morphine morphine morphine:)

314^KemWiz^opiate^Deff for sure sounds like it was an opiate..

Opiates make me and some others I know very talkative

314^KemWiz^opiates^Yea I use to love it, the times I had opiates and coke sure were good but I have 0 recollection other than packing a bowl of crack with heroin on top of my bud and ripping it from the bong lol

314^KemWiz^opiates^A headache the same hour as railing 15mg of oxy? That fuckin sucks.

You probably need to rehydrate, stay hydrated when using and coming off of opiates and any other drug really.

314^KemWiz^opioid^Magnesium has been helping me a lot lately 

I heard ashwagandha root helps opioid receptors

Pretty much just look into thing that help rebuild your brain and things will be a lot better, long breaks are good too.

314^KemWiz^opiates^Yea, I can go all day without anything but I wont be able to sleep with a headache like that. Kinda just said fuck it, I'm taking opiates everyday now.. kinda like a prescription, nothing crazy, although I am snorting some roxi 30s rn lol

Wish opiates weren't a big deal so I could talk to my doctor about getting something for my headache to quit.. I just know it would but weird with the doc I have and weird to introduce myself like that hahaa.. maybe soon..

314^KemWiz^opiate^Worse part for opiate wd, to me right now, is the headache at the end of the day, and my bones feeling weird when I'm relaxing trying to sleep

314^KemWiz^opioid^Yeah it can help, not sure how an interview would go tho, I think kratom can give a little glassy eye effect but idk.

It helps with my anxiety tremendously, but it is a partial opioid agonist, so there could be trouble quitting it without having more anxiety n stuff..

314^KemWiz^opiate^Alright, my bad I'm tired man, but look into the new world order and how the rothschilds orchestrate wars around the world. Everything is part of something much bigger, even drugs, especially opiates, and cocaine.

The whole opiate crisis is just to get people on cheap fent and Mexican heroin.

314^KemWiz^opiate^Hawaii is a expensive area and drugs probably have a higher price due to its economy and transportation.

Roxys are extremely risky these days, most of them are pressed with fentanyl. The opiate world has changed a LOT in the past decade, you gotta be real careful with each batch you get now.

314^KemWiz^opioid^Happy you've found something that works! Kratom does wonders for many, its amazing. It's a good idea to keep your doses low and maybe longer time between doses, and tolerance breaks.
But really, you should be fine taking high doses for a while as long as you're fine with consuming a bunch of plant matter.

Also, you can look into things that help your opioid receptors and metabolism to opioids.

Just dont let kratom take you to painkillers, as those can really ruin a lot of good things in life.

314^KemWiz^opiate^Mix the pink10s with the blue 30s, with some green 15s and white 20s

Ya man opiate life was a lot better just 5 years ago haha

314^KemWiz^opiates^That's an anti depressant, zofran helps with nausea.

Kratom will help you get off the oxys, try a red strain. Or go to a doctor and ask for some meds to help you stop, you can get prescribed Naltrexone at a pharmacy with a physician, you just have to go 24-36 hrs without doing opiates beforehand.

It sounds like you're just getting started, and if you use for another month it's just gonna make things worse.

Take magnesium and potassium for the weird bone feelings when you're feeling asleep, and melatonin and aspirin to calm you down. Just stop buying them pressys

314^KemWiz^opiates^Kratom is great for that man! We're just saying, dont go into it expecting much of a buzz like oxy gives. If you quit oxy for a few months, then kratom may have a more similar effect.

You can get high of kratom if you take enough, just dose 5grams and keep dosing 2-3grams waiting 20-30min between, you'll feel really good, but if you move too much you can get nauseous.

I take kratom pretty much everyday, it for sure helps keep me from doing harder opiates, when I want. Just get a kilo and save it for your rainy days.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
315^offtheoxy^opiates^Also I am currently not using opiates but I am still getting Suboxone I don‚Äôt need to take it anymore but I still want to get the Suboxone‚Äôs to sell it‚Äôs not like the pharmaceutical companies are missing out on anything so please don‚Äôt talk shit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
316^DoodieSmoothie^opium^I actually had my first sleep/dream on opium today. First time i used it. It was so nice, and i want it back so bad.

I was laying on my sofa for like 5 hours straight. Felt like i was sleeping on clouds. I fucking loved it!

I can't remember if i dreamed anything, but i think i did. But whatever it was it was such a nice feeling.

316^DoodieSmoothie^opium^That's the best thing i've heard all day. "Can you buy it on ebay?" LOOL. Of course not. The government doesn't want you to use opium. They would rather want you hooked on heroin. Everything about opium is so hard to research on google.

But yeah, to answer your question. Yes, you can buy it from deep web, but it isn't cheap!!

316^DoodieSmoothie^china^If they're not for injecting, i wonder why they come in single use airproof packaging?
And yeah, i thought i was getting syringes with very thin needle, but they're so thin i can't even get juice through them, haha. I tested it on my skin and it penetrates skin easily. I bought them from china but i believe they are medical grade.

316^DoodieSmoothie^opium^Well, why can't you use addictive drugs too like opium if used responsibly?

It's the addiction that kills.

316^DoodieSmoothie^opium^SAME DUDE!

Opium is a pain in the ass to research i've found out. I had 1g of some low quality opium by my guess. I placed it on aluminum foil and vaped it like they did on youtube, but i got almost no effect of it unless i smoked like 0.3g which is a lot. I payed 30 dollars for 2 good highs. That's alot imo. I vaped it cause i read somewhere on reddit that only 30% of it gets absorbed if you eat it... That guy may be wrong so i'll try oral next time. But god i fell in love with that high :D even tho it didn't make me feel as intoxicated as i thought it would. Just laying in bed dreaming was seriously the best feeling. OOF i want it back so baaad! WHY IS THIS SO GOD DAMN EXPENSIVE??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
317^savarell7^toys^https://app.chewy.com/8NPEvNcuT3 this is the cage I have for my hamster, I wouldn‚Äôt use any other critter trail cages besides this one, it‚Äôs like the only one that meets space requirements for them. But there are tons of really nice other cages :) I like to get toys and boredom breakers that are completely edible if possible

317^savarell7^toys^A lot! It has enough room for his hide out and wheel and toys and everything pretty easily while leaving some space for him to burrow around. The height of it is really nice too and lets me put in a lot of bedding for him

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
318^bglargl^dreams^I once took just 50mg after getting home drunk and getting nauseous. Thought it helps with hangover nausea so it might as well help now. Had trippy fever dreams the whole night but at least didn't trash the house :D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
319^Beautiful-pain^dreams^Juice and Em are my favourite artists of all time, ever since I heard all girls are the same and lucid dreams years ago I gravitated towards his music watched his Instagram lives etc and couldn‚Äôt believe he was gone at 21, in terms of talent juice was the best new generation freestyler no doubt, most of his songs are freestyled he has over 1000 songs in the vault after 2 years, on top of that he could sing and rap, he was the first ‚Äòmelody rapper‚Äô I really loved

319^Beautiful-pain^dreams^Lucid dreams is 100% one of his best songs, it has some of his most meaningful lyrics, amazing beat and it‚Äôs incredibly catchy not to mention the vocals he lays down on the track. A lot of people don‚Äôt like it because they‚Äôre a ‚Äòreal fan‚Äô and it‚Äôs ‚Äòtoo mainstream‚Äô I listen to all his unreleased shit everyday and I can say with certainty lucid dreams is top 5 there‚Äôs a reason it blew up to the level it did

319^Beautiful-pain^black^Similar to mine 

1. Lean wit me 

2. Lucid dreams 

3. Black & White 

4. Robbery

5. You don‚Äôt love me 


Mine changes every single day by the way

319^Beautiful-pain^black^Lean wit me, black & White, armed and dangerous, wasted these are my favourites when I‚Äôm on X

319^Beautiful-pain^black^She saw my snapchat story when I was in a club last night, it was just a photo of me and my mates but my pupils were so dilated that my eyes were basically fully black, she replied to it asking at that point I just said yes no point lying

319^Beautiful-pain^dreams^No worries dude I live in U.K. so I never got many opportunities to see juice live :( but after hearing lucid dreams and all girls are the same on soundcloud I was instantly drawn in to juice and followed him ever since, Instagram streams, unreleased songs etc then cried for days when I heard about his death, life just isn‚Äôt fair but I‚Äôm glad Juice got the recognition he deserved

319^Beautiful-pain^dreams^It‚Äôs your opinion, he has so many amazing songs that there‚Äôs an argument for lots of songs to be his best it‚Äôs just people think it‚Äôs cool to not like lucid dreams because it was popular despite it being amazing. When you start delving in to the unreleased music you find so so many amazing songs that it‚Äôs basically impossible for me to make a consistent top 10 that wouldn‚Äôt change

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
320^kawasakininja58503^opiate^Don't ask specially for the pure 5mg oxys. This will probably come off to him like you are trying to get them for their recreational attraction and not for a legitimate reason.

If I were you I would just tell him that you're having bad side effects with these and that when you were on whatever ones you used to be prescribed that this wasn't happening.

I would also say you're open to whatever the doctor thinks will be best for you and I'd give it a bit on the 5 325s to make it seem like you tried to deal with them but it wasn't working.

Now a days you have to be very careful when dealing with any opiate painkillers unfortunately

320^kawasakininja58503^black^I have the black one. But if I could choose any id get the blue but only best buy has the blue. I didn't like the glow too girly for me. Lol.

320^kawasakininja58503^opiates^You are just kicking the opiods out of the receptors not out of your body. Naloxone has a very short half life so it wears off pretty quickly and then once it wears off any that is still in your body will return to those receptors and you'll have to do it all over again like you normally would.

That's why you can get narcaned and stop over dosing and then shortly after you can start overdosing again even if you don't do any more opiates. Because narcan wears off fast and it doesn't actually rid your body of any opiates just those receptors

320^kawasakininja58503^opiates^If your end goal isn't quitting opiates then the best thing to do would be to find some suboxone from a friend or someone you know. You could probably get away with taking these on a plane whether you hide them or just act like they're your prescription is up to you if it were me I'd hide them though. Shouldn't be too hard they're usually in strips or in small pills.

If you found some subs you'd be good forsure no withdrawals at all. Just research taking it for the first time so you don't end up going into precipitated withdrawal

320^kawasakininja58503^china^Nah I actually haven't been doing fent recently. But I know that most people who have been doing heroin on general for any extended period of time that the regular oxys won't do anything for them other than make it so they're not sick. I was doing fent for a while when I was living up north and was getting like 200 of the pressed fent oxys at a time and also was getting China that I know had fent in it.

320^kawasakininja58503^black^Just did my last shot and need to figure out a way to come up with some money to grab some black, hopefully before the game starts.

320^kawasakininja58503^black^On my old P320 I was running the sig tritium fiber optic front sight with a stock rear sight. And I really liked that setup but if you don't like having anything on the rear you can go on sigs website and buy the correct height sight that is just all black so it will be easier to pick out the front.

320^kawasakininja58503^china^Just depends on who I go through usually a half g is about 40 though I just know a couple people with some good shit doing halfs for 30. I just moved back into my home town from living up north and was paying 50 bucks for .1 out there and 150-200 for a half gram and 350-400 for a full gram. Shit was insane bro.

But I iv currently. Best way to do tar tho In my opinion. Up north I was getting a lot of China with fentanyl and thought I ruined my tolerance but didn't fuck it up too bad just was only getting shitty tar out there when it was around so I thought tar wouldn't ever touch my tolerance but with the good tar back home I can definitely still get high lol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
321^thadribbla^china^(ALL DOPE TESTED NEGATIVE FOR FENT) Top left brown heroin with little grey H rocks as cut to make stronger, top right corner cocaine, left middle pink bag brown heroin,  bottom left corner pressed Xanax, green bag 6-8mg alprazolam sweet tart, bag on top of green bag china heroin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
322^stonednforgot^opiate^Believe me I know.  Here in the states the opiate epidemic and the cathinone epidemic and the crack epidemic is just nasty right now.  I dunno that it is extremely pure and when it had arrived we did a fentanyl test and there was no fentanyl added so I know it's extremely pure.  I've taken too small and I mean small bumps with in the course of four hours all together and originally I had put just a small bit on foil.  I'm not any expert at all with opiates but from how I feel and my pain that deal with everyday inside of my ankle that pain is all gone so I know it's pretty good.  

If anyone would like to talk more about this feel free to P.M. me

322^stonednforgot^opiates^ya im ok on that.  i actually really hates opiates, ive lost more friends 6 feet deep than my hands can count

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
323^nlrobot^opiates^So basically, after you decide to get clean from opiates you go through withdrawals (I‚Äôm sure you know this). In the beginning say 1-5 days you go through the worst of the symptoms and you start feeling better and better. However even after say a month clean you still get these bouts of what feels like minor withdrawals. That‚Äôs the best way I can understand it. Also it stands for Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome I prob should‚Äôve said that

323^nlrobot^opiate^Ahh I see what‚Äôs going on. Well I mean Idk how deep into addiction you were but for me I was fairly deep and met some scumbags along the way who had certain non opiate drugs that would take the edge all the way through detox so I hit them up. I don‚Äôt know if you know people who have access to these drugs I‚Äôm talking about but if not then go the doctor and tell them your detoxing off opiates and thennnnn yeah go from there I guess.

323^nlrobot^opiates^So if I was in your shoes this is what I would do. Im actually coming off Suboxone as I type this and have been an addict for like 8 years or so. I have had bouts of significant clean time in the past and yeah anyways. From what you wrote it sounds like you have a top tier detox kit, however I would use as least methadone as possible. It‚Äôs going to suck but opiates are what your doing this for in the first place. What worked WONDERS for me was benzodiazepines. You said you have Valium right? The first week I was getting clean off subs I don‚Äôt even remember. I mean I don‚Äôt condone drug use (and a lot of people give me shit for telling people to take benzos for withdrawal) but that worked so good for me. Also you have lyrica. I had gabapentin. I love weed too lol. I used a very similar kit minus the methadone and it was virtually painless like 1/10 pain and it went by super fast. Dont be scared. Also be careful mixing  all of those that could be bad. It‚Äôs not really about luck but I‚Äôll send u some anyways!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
324^Xxdont_do_drugzxX^opiates^Alright cool. I know people that take opiates regularly seem to tolerate mixing alcohol but I'm not a frequent taker (as I get high for the third night in a row) so was just a bit paranoid because of the warnings ive seen. Thanks for clearing things up :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
325^algino199^opiates^Headache and brain fog is the only symptom? That seems rather normal I would imagine. As any hot sweats anxiety/insomnia apparently have passed for you , I‚Äôm sure some Advil working out eating right staying hydrated will fix you up.

Also depends how long you were using Kratom and if it was stemming from an issue with Other opiates

325^algino199^opiates^Well knowing dose is key...I don‚Äôt know what you mean by best way to take? If a capsule swallow if powder mix with drink. 

What exactly are you on? What opiates? If you went 3 days with no real symptoms do it again !

325^algino199^opiate^From Kratom? You must have been taking a lot o et long period or switched from a harder opiate

325^algino199^opiates^Like in the first few days of quitting opiates? Is it safe to assume you bought headshop/gas station extracts?

325^algino199^opiate^If your able to taper your opiate of
Choose  DO It

I will say if it‚Äôs dope switch to real oxy or something cuz you can‚Äôt really determine how much of xyz is In your dope will just makes it much easier

325^algino199^opiate^There‚Äôs a chance you got Kratom that has Opiate analogues in it. There was some headship brand a while back that was found to be contaminating their product with some unscheduled opiate similar time tramadol/codeine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
326^macincos^opioid^I chatted with a pharmacist online. He said that while Belbuca film is meant for every 12hrs, it probably stops being effective around 8-10hrs. I waited 8hrs between doses of the two meds. It worked out well. He also said Belbuca (or Buprenorphine) is designed so that you CAN take your regular opioid for breakthrough pain. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say that Belbuca will prevent your other meds from working as well but that wasn‚Äôt my experience at all. It worked quite well for me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
327^HootCares^black^I paid $50 around black Friday and it's working just fine in a 2200g office PC. A bit large though

327^HootCares^black^Yeah just dumped mine in the trash and through my cats litter on top for good measure. I'm hoping it doesn't get worse but, that tapering anxiety was horrible. I might walk to the dollar store and get some benadryl now actually. Through away my kratom and tossed my cats litter on top for good measure. Hopefully I'm not that fucking desperate for kratom because garbage pickup isn't till thursday which hopefully will signal 1 week clean off this stuff. Modafinil is definitely helping. Not sure if black seed oil or ashwaganda are doing anything but, i don't care placebo is better than nothing. Just want this week to be over to be honest. I have a 3 day weekend next week and thinking of trying microdosing muchrooms.

327^HootCares^black^Update ordered a pound of vitamin c powder, some ashwaganda, and black seed oil on amazon as well as 5 Xanax bars. I think I'll take a dose halfway through my shift on Friday and see if I can tough it out over the weekend maybe pick up some hemp flower. At the very least I'd have given it a shot. My brain is just going hyper phys-icing myself out over this and i'd rather just get it over with tbh. I don't want to spend a month reading about every possible thing that can happen.

327^HootCares^black^I'm not too worried about that. Last time I had 100 it took me 6 months to finish. I just want something for sleep and anxiety that I know is what it claims to be rather than buying black market pressed pills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
328^Mitchy749^opiates^you could take the pills and then 10 to 20 minutes later smoke a couple bowls, both will hit you at once and it is heaven, you should feel more of the opiates too, as weed intensifies the opiates, same as dxm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
329^nardis_bass^opiate^Wow, that would be absolutely amazing!!!  
Do they do repeats? 

No repeats for any opiate (schedular 8) here. 

Got private health and see two specialists for my pain. 

 But the rules for Bupe are different here. It fucking sucks.

And only have the patches for pain,

In Aus, you can‚Äôt even have small doses of subutex or Suboxone for chronic pain, which is left addictive that full agonists like the oxycodone they‚Äôre happy for me to be on.

329^nardis_bass^opiate^In Australia you full have to jump through the hoops to get subs,
 Need to tell a Dr your an opiate addict, then if they prescribe subs,
You need to go to the pharmacy every day and have a supervised dose for a month,
Then you get weekend take always, 
And I think after 6 months you get a script for a month or two, but can only get 7 at a time, wait a week and get the next 7.
And as far as I know in Aus they only come in 2, 4 and 8mg suboxone sublingual films 

I‚Äôve never been in the methadone or suboxone program, 
I take Slow release Targin (Oxy:Naloxone)  the Naloxone is in it to stop constipation and also to stop people from snorting or IV. 

Australia even is proposing  new rules  for OxyContin, as you can only get the new formulation, because the generic brands, you can still crush and snort and do what ever you want with them. 
So they want o make it so that with some patients, if the Dr thinks they are suss, will make it clear on the script that they can only get the temper proof OxyContin 

Came out of a study, I had rights of prescriptions of OxyContin and say the Aspen brand of extended release oxycodone (same drug, same Doses, same extended release. 
And something like 30% went for the oxyContin (new tamper proof) and 70 went for the generic brand that don‚Äôt have the tamperproof formulation. 
Siri keep the other drug companies and businesses, they‚Äôre pretty much forcing the other drug companies that sell OxyContin, to make a temper proof formulation,  Otherwise they will threat to take it off the market.

If I can find the link, I will share it, it‚Äôs all ideas at this point, but no in Australia, it will probably end up happening. 

Anyway, what happens when you get a prescription in the states how many do you get? I cannot believe how strict Australia is, how is somebody supposed to travel overseas if the Lauries you only get seven a week after six months of being on the program.

329^nardis_bass^opioid^I personally talk about how it impacts my day,
How I feel when I get out of bed and how much pain I am in.

How proper pain relief I can function, work and have a social life. 

How I can drive for an hour then my back starts to kill me, 

Also how it impacts on my sleep and why I have chronic insomnia and why I am still on sleeping pills,

If he wants me off sleeping pills, then surely I could have a breakthrough pain med that helps me nod as well. I‚Äôm on Zopliclone as a sleeping tablet, and he thought he would try Clonadine (blood pressure medication, and also makes you a bit tired.) 

Oxy gives me heaps of energy and makes me very talkative,
But morphine puts me on the nod. 

Also tell him you‚Äôre mindful that you‚Äôre opioid tolerant and that you have thought about it and you‚Äôre not opioid dependent,

If a pain specialist sees a patient knows the difference, they generally know that you‚Äôre ok to go the dose for.

329^nardis_bass^opiates^Dude that sounds sick, 
I‚Äôll give that a crack, I‚Äôve chewed them before which wasn‚Äôt that great, maybe there is still a lot of those pieces of slow release coat floating around.

Do you have a day I crashed up into powder, matching up into toilet paper like a parachute and swallowed it, and that was decent as. 

Can you still take opiates bro?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
330^skater30^black^If you blacked out, you probably took way too much. People who black out on xanax usually binge drop the pills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
331^BurtSquirtzle^dreams^Sounds like you could have just stopped stealing the fent and told your wife and not put your family and lifestyle in jeopardy. But you know some people make a rock bottom where there is none. I try to be supportive in this sub, but you really created your own misery here. This feels like a shit post to me, every addict dreams of being in that position free pharmaceutical grade fent, a nice home, family and money your either bullshitting, or a complete idiot. I'd assume your cush ass job has sick time. Go to rehab no addict compromises lifestyle because they "feel bad" judging by your 0 day old account I'm calling bullshit nothing in your posts checks out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
332^trap_papi_kujo^opiate^Okay lil buddy , let kujo drop some knowledge on you...your lil baby brain still undeveloped, I would feel uncomfortable telling you to smoke weed (even though I was caught selling in my school at 12) üòÇ I feel like your interests should be on something other than opiates (one of the word at most addictive substances) just because it‚Äôs in some sugar syrup.... with that being said when I was your age that shit would have went in one ear and out the other so measure like 3-3.5 ounces of Karo or make your own syrup, and 60 ML added to the syrup of zzzquil YOU NEED A OPIATE like codeine pills, oxy or even xans to crush up in water and mix with the syrup ... don‚Äôt kill yourself or friends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
333^DrSubs^opiate^Hahahaha I know!! I started seeing them more n more lately in family Guy and American Dad. Lots of opiate references.

333^DrSubs^opiates^I think we all take opiates to overshadow pain that we don't wanna, necessarily, face. I got on subs with a game plan though. I got on it not cause I was spinning out of control but because I didn't have any structure. If you asked me what is *THE* reason you even got into opiates, I wouldn't have a direct answer for that. But subs provided a schedule, it allowed me to stop worrying about shit I had no control over, it allowed me to wake up every morning with a smile on my face and go to work, live my life. Depression runs in my family obviously alongside anxiety. So yeah, along with therapy, subs definitely help me see the reasons why I still get up every single day to do what I gotta do.

333^DrSubs^opiate^2mg is a lot for someone who's hardly had opiates... And for someone to try n say she's one of those people who don't get any relief from opiates, that's not a good enough reason lol. Ya know? Cause that's A LOT. That will make most opiate naive people throw the fuck up for a day n a half

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
334^thomasmonson3^opiates^Tried. It doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs beyond that. I have withdrawn from opiates and suboxone and it feels closer to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
335^zarleyzar^opioid^they give methadone for mat because it keeps people off the harder stuff when suboxone treatment fails. it keeps people alive. thats all. like for instance i took suboxone and i kept using. it didnt work for me. methsdone does because its a stronger opioid.
    it get you high just like suboxone ,but its just gets you higher. some people need that to stay abstinent from fent. everyones different. mat can be used for the short term for people who can ween off and stay clean or it can be used for the long. nothing wrong with the long term either if thats whats best for the person.
   ive been on methadone for 11 years now. im in good health.i have been a manager of a store for 10 years now. have kids, a house gf etc. i might be on for life and thats ok! give urself another 10 years in this life and you should understand the situation better,but hope i provided some insight. gl.

336^mountain_burroughs^opium^even if i have a low tolerance? i‚Äôve heard pretty good things about opium from various people who‚Äôve visited India

337^HattieLouWho^opiates^You need a diagnosis and a referral to pain management. Then expect to try other alternative treatments before they resort to opiates unless you have a pretty rough diagnosis. Oh and you have to pass a drug test and most won‚Äôt prescribe anything in the first visit. 

I have crps so they were pretty much pushing them from the start albeit at low doses while we tried other options. Still on relatively low doses of hydrocodone but it helps considerably. 

After that it‚Äôs appts every 4 weeks with random testing and possibly pill counts depending on your provider. Good luck!

337^HattieLouWho^opiates^It can definitely do that but it‚Äôs a super slippery slope. I would suggest getting under the care of a psychiatrist to find the right combo of meds and therapy to help you without the risks. I am a chronic pain patient also on meds for anxiety/depression and I see both a pain management doctor and psychiatrist. I did not start opiates until well after my other issues were addressed and under control though. I take lexapro, lamictal (which is well known to help with pain too - so added bonus) and a very low dose of seroquel to control that side of things.

337^HattieLouWho^opiates^I completely disagree with this as a chronic pain patient on opioids. They should never be a first line or second line treatment but when other options have failed to evidence adequate relief they should be available. I have crps which is considered the most painful chronic condition and opiates make the difference between working a full time job, volunteering and being an active mom and being housebound relying on either my husband or govt handouts. Which person is better for society? Which person has a the fuller life because of them? 

I was really, really reluctant to add one to my regimen but it has made a huge difference at a low dose (7.5/325 hydrocodone/apap, 3/day). I don‚Äôt think any of the chronic pain patients on opiates want to be - we just want less pain - but when all else fails then it‚Äôs an option we should all have.

337^HattieLouWho^opioid^Do you have a pcp that can refer you to pain management? Or whoever diagnosed your condition? With all of the opioid hysteria they‚Äôre not going to prescribe at urgent care or ER for anything chronic, unfortunately. I would pursue pain management ASAP and ask your primary if they can help until then.

337^HattieLouWho^opiates^I would recommend asking for a referral to pain management ASAP. If you don‚Äôt need it you can cancel the appt but they have lots of tools at their disposal that can greatly improve your quality of life. I have crps which is insanely painful and there‚Äôs no way I could function without proper pain management. 

I second what others have said about opiates. I was really reluctant at first but they have given me my life back. I was calling out of work, crying in pain and pretty much miserable. But adding a low dose of hydrocodone made a huge difference and now I only regret not doing it sooner. I also take lyrica, Celebrex (which is great for arthritis by the way) and tizanidine as needed. Plus lidocaine patches ...have you tried those? They‚Äôre OTC in the states - try the salon pas brand and see if it helps you. 

If you have other questions I‚Äôm happy to chat, just PM me. Good luck and hang in there, it gets better once you have a proper treatment plan in place.

337^HattieLouWho^opioid^Have you been to a doctor to try to figure out why it‚Äôs all happening? There‚Äôs not a ton of info in your post so it‚Äôs hard to know what all you have done to date. Also have you been to pain management yet? I would try both do those ASAP. There is nothing wrong with being a responsible opioid user if it improves your quality of life. It almost sounds like Ehler Danlos syndrome based on what you said but I only have a tiny piece of the puzzle to go off. 

I would also consider a psychiatrist. If you tell another doctor you have contemplated suicide you could wind up with a whole host of other issues so getting mental health under control is just as important as the pain at this point. The two go hand in hand but PM seems more inclined to help if you say you have a psychiatrist already. At least around here. 

I hope this helps some.

337^HattieLouWho^opioid^I would be honest with them and tell them how it‚Äôs limiting your functionality and ask what else they have to offer. I would not say ‚Äúwell when I take two I can function‚Äù because that will be a red flag of abusing meds even though you‚Äôre not. I would also say it doesn‚Äôt work as well as it used to and kind of let them connect the dots. 

I‚Äôm in a similar situation where my crps is worsening so meds that have been working aren‚Äôt really cutting it. I have my monthly PM appt tomorrow and going to talk about options - hoping not to increase my dose but I also need to be able to hold it together enough to work and get a few hours of sleep. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs some non opioid option we haven‚Äôt tried yet...but short of scs or pain pump not sure what that would be. And scs won‚Äôt help upper and lower limb pain or my face so I‚Äôve ruled that one out.

337^HattieLouWho^dreams^I have really vivid dreams but they haven‚Äôt been scary yet...maybe try watching happy videos or something before bed?

338^percythrowaway21^black^Probably flualp which is why they seem so potent. Nothing wrong with flualp but be careful as it‚Äôs easier to black out on.

338^percythrowaway21^china^That‚Äôs not the case at all. If you search this sub a bit you‚Äôll actually see most people recommend buying on Alibaba specifically from KingBrite. They use the newest Samsung LM301H diodes as well as Meanwell drivers. Those are the same diodes that the best domestic LEDs use. Also most of the ‚ÄúUnited States brands‚Äù that you‚Äôd buy from have their lights manufactured in China.

339^Hamspamm^black^Tried again in morning. Got too waiting room and saw beings dancing. There was a black guy with sunglasses on. Good vibes. Going deeper tonight will report back.

339^Hamspamm^opiates^You know what the closest feeling to opiates is or even better if you ask me is being in love. Like really truly deeply in love. Are you in love?

339^Hamspamm^opiates^Don't downvote because you don't see the point. Being on opiates is kind of like being in a hot tub

340^markgglasgow^china^Cnd the start of the name by any chance .. offers synthetic or china.. at different levels..

341^D3LiRiOuS_^opiates^Hahaha yea I know the feeling I tapered of benzos for a year coz just couldn't stop. I'm guessing OPIATES is going to be super fucking hard... Gotta get that self control some how lmao.

But after 3 years of use I feel its a much needed thing to do for a long break to lower tolorance to 0.

341^D3LiRiOuS_^opiates^I've tried several docs but my GP surgery in the UK for my area doesn't like giving opiates for people with previous addictions like me to benzos that I have had to taper off under doc supervision. Which sucks coz they have left me in sever pain.

341^D3LiRiOuS_^opiates^I'm willing to live it for a bit but I self medicate for bank pain from a car crash which my doc will only give me naproxen for which is useless as fuck due to me telling her about my Bad benzos addiction. Fucking suck I have to result to self medicating opiates but I can't live with that pain

341^D3LiRiOuS_^opioid^Yea that's what I was aiming at 2-3 month taper on dhc as its a weaker opioid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
342^throwaway4advice729^opiate^He‚Äôs been using for four years so I‚Äôm hoping this is the downside of his opiate career. We were together for 9 years before he began using, so it‚Äôs not a cut and dry ‚Äúget out while you still can‚Äù. His addiction has already given me nothing but heartache. He is the most amazing person when he‚Äôs sober and I‚Äôm trying desperately to convince him to get clean. And I know. Only he can make that decision. I‚Äôm still hoping he makes the right one. I selfishly want to stay and be with him, but it‚Äôs taking such an emotional and mental toll on me. Last question of the first paragraph broke my heart. I know what I would say. And it‚Äôs not what I want to hear.

342^throwaway4advice729^opiates^Wow. I‚Äôve never heard of this but will definitely look into it and encourage him to do so as well. Have you ever gone back to opiates since trying voacana?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
343^TH3xD3VIN3^black^I believe I can touch it up. The red is actually peel wrap for cars, and if I can't fix it with black I'll probably re do it

343^TH3xD3VIN3^black^I'm not done yet, I'm going to fix it with black paint around the logo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
344^ativantaliban^opiate^Yeah that was my thinking too, I was more just looking for any otc syrup that wouldn‚Äôt have any negative interactions with the opiate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
345^ecp4life^opiate^I've been told by doctors that some people are predisposed to opiate addiction due to some fuck up in the limbic part of the brain.We must be the lucky fuckers I guess.

345^ecp4life^opiate^Can anyone give advice for strains and doses to  use Kratom for opiate withdrawals? I would really appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
346^Kakkarot1707^opiates^Really?? That‚Äôs weird. Did you ever like not shit before when you weren‚Äôt active? I know on real opiates The only problem I had were my shits were like really hard. I still usually shit at least once every 2 days. But I play soccer and move around a lot so that could help. I also started taking vitamins and fiber based stuff a lot

346^Kakkarot1707^opiate^No I was saying in his story he got hooked to bupe first on the ‚Äústreet‚Äù and not like full agonist opiates like oxy or herion. I feel like most people get high on the full opiates for a long time first and then when they can‚Äôt afford or support their habit somehow they would get prescribed bupe to come off or do bupe to help with WDs from the full agonist opiates. I was on opiates for 3 years and just started bupe a week ago and it was the first time I ever did subs. I just feel like you really can‚Äôt abuse subs or get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù from them like a traditional opiate. But you will def become dependent on the bupe over time when it‚Äôs prescribed. And for me I plan on staying on subs for like 6 months max just to get my funds and life back together!

346^Kakkarot1707^opiate^Yea no I get that with the full opiate agonist. It‚Äôs because your tolerance shoots up which means you had to take much more which means you get more negative side effects like that. But with the subs I don‚Äôt get like that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
347^Playboy72^opioid^I have tried the Green strain, It feels like mild opioid high. Basically you need to find the strain that suits you. But I have heard from many that the green ones feels like opioid high.

347^Playboy72^opioid^Started with Tramadol 100mg first time. just once it was one of the most powerful feeling I ever felt. Then found alot of Codeine at home 1 year after I tried Trams. Ate them all and thats when I fell in love with opioids. The strongest opioid I tried was oxycodone 30mg. Shit it hit so hard that I slept lol. Since then I use opioids responsibly. My favorite is Tramadol since I can get of it easy. Oxy gave me withdrawals after 2 time use. So I save them for very special moments.

347^Playboy72^opioid^Never tried it, What is it exactly? Is it opioid? And can you get addicted?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
348^laura3lisha^opiate^okok i understand. i feel kinda disrespectful rn :// is there some other opiate that would do the same with less harm?

348^laura3lisha^opiate^i‚Äôll reconsider my choice. what opiate would you recommend, which has somewhat the same effect? i‚Äôm looking for that nodding off type shit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
349^CantSayCuomoW_O_Homo^china^Powder sugar was the only thing I had around my house, I won‚Äôt be banging anymore of this batch to be more on the safe side but I mixed 500 mg powder sugar to .758 China White and its still potent as shit.  Still smokes great too and runs on foil well also.

Thanks for the reply, brother.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
350^canteatjustone^opiates^Only opiates and benzos.  When i'm not of opiates first thoughts as soon as i wake up are about killing myself.  Not that i would consider it yet but when im on them that thought never crosses my mind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
351^familyfeedaye^opiate^Oxys seem to be the most stimulating opiate i have tried, but its weird sometimes i will feel motivated and social whilst also feeling relaxed then other times I‚Äôm just straight nodding

351^familyfeedaye^opiates^Must‚Äôve been cut or a bit weaker they came in note book paper folded, like extra chewing gum wrappers with a brown power in it but basically i spent new years eve getting up every 10 minutes a vomiting into one of them third world country toilets (the lil hole in the ground) my vision was fucked up stronger then any opiates have done for me and had the worst itches.

351^familyfeedaye^opiates^It would but MDMA has the potential for other people (I haven‚Äôt experienced this myself) to synergise into a loopy confusing experience with all that in the mix, IME when i tried heroin first time in Kenya i had 3 chunky lines and was fucked but I wouldn‚Äôt say it was that powerful to overtake 3 different Psychedelics with the most powerful one on top of the mix whilst also Ketamine but then again ket potentiates opiates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
352^Doranlofi420^opioid^Are you going to wear this? :) If you would thats so sweet to look at.. I would cry everytime reading that and than looking at that little pretty face thats so much better than any opioid high there is.

Ofcourse I meant the baby

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
353^chonch_king^opioid^It sounds like you have sleep apnea from your previous heroin usage/addiction. Its common for people with past opioid addictions. You should get it checked out by a doctor as soon as possible, because it can be fatal in some cases.

354^i-xan-not-remeber^black^I got a source puts 1mg on blotters and the first tome I got this I did 2 and it was instant black out but by far my favorite. And I have a decent Xanax tolerance .

355^CelestialSerenade^black^How many other games have skyboxes that realistically fade to black as you increase in elevation? No one playing the game normally would have even experienced it.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiate^Good question indeed. My wife, who used to take acid, coke and mdma with me when we were dating (and who still likes to smoke pot) tells me every time when that topic comes up to never ever tell our kids about my drug use or her past drug experiences. Our kids are still toddlers so I don't know yet how to address that topic, but I do know that I will not stick to the typical parent bullshit propaganda of "drugs are evil just because I (and the government) say so", but rather educate them about their real risks. I will warn them about the real dangers of drugs. For example, what opioids did to me and how many of my old friends died because of them. I still battle an ongoing addiction to medically prescribed morphine. Used to do heroin too but got over it with the help of my addictioligist, yet I'm still addicted to opioid painkillers these days. Which is a downward spiral that I never ever want my kids to fall into. Opiate withdrawl and the endless circle to just feel normal is something I wouldn't wish upon my greatest enemy.
When it comes to pot and psychedelics, I would like to educate them properly: that they have all the time in the world to explore these things if they wish to, but only once their minds and brains are fully developed, meaning over 21. I want to teach them to reach their full intellectual potential without chemicals. Same goes for most other drugs: humans get high since the days of ancient Rome, Athens or Alexandria. They have their place in history, but all of them have so much destructive potential if used frequent and while being too young. I want them to at least not damage their brains and bodies while they are still teenagers.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^Daily use aka addictions:
1. Opiates (300-400mg morphine hcl)
2. Cannabis (1g of weed or 0.5g of hashish)
3. Nicotine (1 pack of cigarettes)

Substances I enjoy occasionally in a non addictive behavior:
1. Psychedelics (LSD, Psilocybin, Mescaline, DMT, 2CB)
2. Dissociatives (Ketamine, PCP and their RC substitutes)
3. Uppers/Entheogens (MDMA, Amphetamine, Ritalin, Coke)
4. Benzos (Diazepam, Alprazolam)

Depression, Melancholia, post operative chronic pain, narcisstic and or borderline behavior

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiate^Ecstasy spiked with opiates is another bullshit teenage urban legend. People told me the same lies 20 years ago. These days in Europe pills get tested professionaly in almost every country. Some contain amphetamine along with the mdma, some contain a psychedelic like 2cb, but never ever in known history there were tested pills with mdma and heroin (or any other opiate) going around. It's bullshit myths like this that make this subreddit so cringeworthy.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^A year is easy. I was using opiates on and off for 10 years all throughout my 20s. Never got addicted. Until I had to undergo 5 surgeries with lots of physical pain, coupled with mental pain by my dad dying and my then girlfriend leaving me. That‚Äôs when addiction ‚Äûfinally‚Äú hit me.
It‚Äôs not about willpower, it‚Äôs about circumstances. Heavy physical and emotional trauma mixed with long going scripts for heavy painkillers get you there. And then, it‚Äôs almost no turning back anymore.
Anyone who thinks they won‚Äôt get addicted because they successfully flirted with opiates for a year or two without ever withdrawing is lying to themselves. All it takes is life itself hitting you hard.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^black^And as my 3rd comment, you don't have to be scared on a stronger dose either. The known maximum amount of black market lsd blotters is in the 200 to 250mcg range. No lab will lay stronger blotters for a mass market. Now, 200 to 250mcg is considered a "full psychedelic dose". It's the same dose Albert Hofmann tried on his first self experiment with lsd. The visuals and the mind trip will be stronger in that range, but it's not at all unpleasant with the right set and setting. A bad set and setting can be hell on 120mcg and vice versa. Personally, I prefer mid to high doses of lsd to small ones, as it's much easier to go with the flow of the experience as it sucks you in. Lower doses can make me paranoid, whereas 200mcg plus forces my mind to just let the psychedelic do its work, fighting against it is no longer an option if you understand what I mean.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opium^I had the same experience with lsd. If you dose opiates (in my case it was either opium or heroin back then) simultaneously to your psychedelic of choice, it will kill the trip almost immediatly.
What does work great though is taking your opiates at the tail end of the trip for a smooth comedown. Did this several times lately with pharmaceutical hydromorphone or morphine - and it worked great every time!
If you are addicted to opiates but want to trip on psychedelics, I'd suggest to take your poison of choice a few hours before you trip. Just take enough to not go into withdrawal during your trip and do more once the comedown sets in. Nothing is better than to slowly transform the psychedelic rush into nodding and daydreaming while getting sleepy and comfy under warm blankets. To me this felt like dozing off in an Victorian opium den, 19th century style :)

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^Ketamine is the best combo for nearly every psychedelic. Throwing mdma in the mix can be very fun and re recreational as well. Opiates at the tail end of the experience can make the comedown very smooth and pleasurable.
My favourite combo:
LSD, 6hours later 2CB, 1 hour later Mdma, and after I peaked twice on lsd and 2cb add 100mg Ketanest via I/M application for a deep k-hole. While exiting the parallel universe of k_land, I like to "finish me off" with 100-150mg morphine hcl. Oh and weed/hash is an essential from the start. Low doses of benzos can be administers if one is having an unpleasant experience, but that's very unlikely with this combo.
If I would have one day left on earth to experience nothing but pleasure, this would be my to go mix.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^black^Dmt is much more colorful and visual. 5meo has no oevs, only black and white cevs. What they share in "similar experiences" is that both can lead to the most realistic simulation of death / ego death known to me. I had entity contact on dmt, never on 5meo. 5meo experiences also tend to be (for me) more on the rough and dark side, being pushed in an eternal circle of life and death and suffering, whereas dmt has an Alice in wonderland kind of uplifting feel: everything is crazy but it's OK and kind of fun.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opioid^What my good doctor told me lately in defense of the evil/sadistic ones: these docs treat you bad because they are afraid of getting charged and / or loosing their license due to the ongoing opioid epidemic crazyness in politics and media. Before they risk getting in trouble for writing you a decent script, they prefer to chase you away by threats, accusations and lies. Most of them are not evil in nature, but rather scared of destroying their career or getting jailed themselves by supplying a patient that "might" look like an abuser with opioid scripts. His view made sense to me on second thought. Doesn't change the fact that there are more than enough fucktards out there with medical diplomas who enjoy emposing their power over you and seeing you withdrawal from the very same meds they prescribed to you in the first place...

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^I know man... Not too proud of this habbit either, especially since I became a father of twin toddlers. Their mum is a lawyer working against human trafficking and weapons and drug trade, so my hobbies and addictions are not too welcome in family life :/
Until this summer I was on 24mg hydromorphone ER plus 6x 2.6mg IR. Plus the occasional heroin binge on top. Then my old doctor (who's been prescribing me opioids since 5 years) got under opioid epidemic surveillance and suddenly accused me of not needing the pain meds any longer and actually being a junky and dropped my dosage to 2x4mg a day. Needless to say, I was in almost unbearable withdrawal. In the following months I spent almost all of my savings on dope (heroin, sometimes pretty pure, other times fent laced) and was visiting 3 other pain doctors who all either turned me down, accused me of being a junky or wanted to send me to rehab. While I know I'm addicted to opiates, I also have real chronic pain after 4 surgeries on my spine and two on my elbow which left me with constant nerve pain and inflammations.
Luckily, in November I finally met a new pain doc / addictiologist. I was completely honest with him about my usage of everything (which the urine test verified anyhow but I thought I better start this thing without any more lies) and to my surprise, he turned out to be an super understanding non judgemental doc. He put me on 400mg extended release morphine and didn't even force me to quit Marijuana as he knows it helps people in my situation. Only thing he was really strict about was to never ever use heroin again, especially these days with so many cutting agents and fentanyl analoges in the dope. He also asked me to stop benzos for good and only use them as a last resort thing. After I followed his orders and the urine samples only came out positive for morphine and thc, he became almost friendly towards me and didn't treat me like a piece of shit addict like the other recent docs did. His biggest fear for me was either ODing on cut heroin or getting in trouble with the police. 
So yes, it is a pretty big dose, but it also allowed me to get out of the vicious heroin circle. And I am so fucking grateful to finally have found a doc again who trusts me and is willing to prescribe what it takes to deal with the chronic pain issues.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opioid^During the breakup with the (back then) love of my life I also had to undergo 5 surgeries on my spine. The pain from the operations coupled with the emotional trauma of the break up / being all alone lead me to a serious opioid addiction that to this very day is still impregnated in my brain. I start each day with 300mg morphine hcl up my butt. If I could go back in time, I would urge my younger self not to seek peace in addictive chemicals. I know it's not easy. But I wouldn't want you to go the same path as me with benzos.
Hole yourself into another universe with the ketamine, but please don't fall into the benzo trap. Wishing you ‚ù§Ô∏è!

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^I'm taking extended release morphine daily for pain management. No problems while mixing it with ketamine except its more likely to throw up, so get yourself in a safe position before entering the hole.
A positive side effect of using k along with opiates: ketamine seems to have synergies with morphine in its pain blocking activities. After a day on k, I can usually lower my typical dose of morphine by 30 to 50 % for a few days for pain managent - or, if used "normally", the ketamine allows me to fully feel the euphoric effects of morphine again, which normally subside with regular use / once physical addiction sets in.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiate^I never tried that one, but speaking in terms of potency: 100mg of morphine hcl, used orally, never got me really high or nodding out. Its my favorite opiate in terms of pain management & analgesia and it helped me tremendously to get off the heroin train and it's withdrawal trainstations. But for a decent high/rush, those 100mg needed to be boofed. Never tried IV or IM application as I only do this with sealed pharmaceutical vials and the morphine hcl came in ER pills. If you want to have the typical dreamy, carefree euphoric high, you either have to do 100mg via your butthole or you need to take much more orally (depends on tolerance of corse, for me it's 300 to 400mg of the er formula - but then I feel it for over 24 hours.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opium^Opium is for home use. Dissos are great for museums and exhibitions. I literarily got lost in paintings while visiting the Prado in Madrid.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^Ketamine is the best combo for nearly every psychedelic. Throwing mdma in the mix can be very fun and re recreational as well. Opiates at the tail end of the experience can make the comedown very smooth and pleasurable.
My favourite combo:
LSD, 6hours later 2CB, 1 hour later Mdma, and after I peaked twice on lsd and 2cb add 100mg Ketanest via I/M application for a deep k-hole.

Low doses of benzos can be administers if one is having an unpleasant experience, but that's very unlikely with this combo.
If I would have one day left on earth to experience nothing but pleasure, this would be my to go mix.

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opiates^Yeah opiates could be the best thing ever. Wouldn't there be addiction and those very real and brutal withdrawal effects. That's what smashes you to pieces in the end...

356^meskalinpsilocybin^opioid^Umm, yes? I mean it depends where you live I guess. I live in a city of 2 million people, so the statistics that everyone and their dog knows at least one person selling black market drugs and or pharmaceuticals is pretty high. If you‚Äôre also coming from more liberal/artsy education circles, chances are high nearly 50 percent of your friends like to get high too. And of those 50, half of them have their own plug, the rest share it with them. These circles get less close once you finish college/university and follow the mo to fr job/office career routine. But every time you‚Äôre in need to go back to your relatively careless days at campus, those old friends are still there to call and meet up. That means, if they didn‚Äôt die in the last 10 years, which is usually the case in 1 out of 5 these days.  4 close friends of my youth have died meanwhile, either by suicide or by opioid overdose. 
So yes, you don‚Äôt have to live in a ghetto to ‚Äúget involved‚Äù. Actually, it‚Äôs the opposite.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
357^trapstarb^opiates^Please tell me you are not carrying someone else‚Äôs piss in your tits at all times to pass just fucking weed. If so I find that so hilarious like the thought has me roaring. 

If you are under 18 your parents can‚Äôt kick you out and when you are over 18 they don‚Äôt have authority to demand you take a drug test. 

I would just tell them that you are using weed, and that nothing they can do will stop you and they can do what they like with that information. Accept it or get mad, you don‚Äôt care it doesn‚Äôt effect you, if they wanna run circles in their heads they can. This worked for all my friends that tried it and the ONE that didn‚Äôt, he still gets treated like a 8 year old at 23.

If you are using harder drugs I guess it‚Äôs up to you to decide but ultimately I see being honest as a good thing. Like if opiates then your parents can get narcan so if you OD you don‚Äôt die. When I was 16 I told my mom I was smoking weed and she was very mad but over a year she accepted it. By 19 she knew I was doing coke oxy Xanax basically trying everything. She understands that alcohol is just as bad and can easily lead to addiction. Also if you are upfront in the future if you freak out and have a mental one (it happens more than you think with drugs if you are a daily user) they will know what is going on and can calm you down.

357^trapstarb^opiates^I use to wake up to a half gram line of cocaine when I was a daily user. I would still be using if it didn't stop being good for me. Now when I use it I have to take opiates or xanax because I get paranoid and if I use too much I will induce psychosis. I had a ball of pure for new years and that was too much I was psychotic for a day after even with opiates. I only do pure, I test my supply and I know how to wash it. Don't overdo it and ruin it altogether for yourself like I did. Treat it with respect and it will show that respect back to you in the form of blissful highs and no comedowns.

357^trapstarb^opiates^Yeah moderation is key, I use hard opiates once a month oxy or heroin and have been for 7 years. I have even tried the needle 2 years ago and deemed it not worth the hassle. I was a previous addict to benzo but at least I can own it and choose not to buy them. 

Now I just use coke on bday and New Years, opiates once a month and I use weed daily but tend to have one week off a month. 

Drugs are so much better now I moderate them and I am a better person. I just as happy without drugs which is how it should be. Drugs to run away from your problems is a big bad but if your life is in tact it is like icing on an already delicious cake.

357^trapstarb^opiates^I use opiates once month sometimes less and have been for 7 years. I usually go for 80mg Oxy or the equivalent in heroin. Due to the fact I have 0 tolerance each time I have a massive 5 hour nod which is enhanced with weed. The nod is like a lucid dream and is so vivid it feels real and I don‚Äôt realize until I open my eyes and figure out that this is actually reality. The euphoria is pretty strong too. 

I can see why homeless people use or people depressed in poverty, use everyday despite knowing they will get physically addicted.If you have nothing or live in poverty the nod is so strong you will feel like you are living in a mansion  with models and unlimited money. Whatever you want it will and can trick you, delude you into believing in a reality that doesn‚Äôt even exist. I‚Äôm fortunate enough when I come down I am happy to be back where I am.

Most the time I use nowadays I don‚Äôt nod about having money I feel like I‚Äôm a bird flying above random countries. My favorite was Egypt. I can‚Äôt experience this anyway in real life so I have to use opiates to get my bird fantasy fix.

357^trapstarb^opiate^Yeah I tell people if you are gunna get addicted physically to anything at least pick opiates. The high is way better and benzo withdrawals make any opiate withdrawal look like a walk in the park.

357^trapstarb^black^Why are people defending her she basically said all white people are ugly.

If I went oh look she works in a liquor store she must be poor, all black people are poor. Everyone would lose it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
358^illendent^dreams^Rarely, maybe two or three times per year, I will have strange and incredibly vivid dreams that I absolutely cannot stop thinking about. I can remember at least three of them to this day. They felt more real than reality. Often these dreams contain characters that I love more than my own family. 

Its interesting food for thought, but we will likely never know what these dreams are and if they mean anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
359^SensitiveCortex^opioid^Miss Not in Constant Pain Due to Opioid Denial * I am sorry if you're experiencing a lot of pain. In my case tramadol worked well for pain which made me unable to function for a few days. It made me dizzy and made me throw up. It was very strong to me. I did not mean to make it look like the strongest painkiller out there. I know there are people in Constant Pain out there who need more to function.

359^SensitiveCortex^opiate^I'm sure if you have been wounded in battle or having a 19th century style tooth extraction, you may need a real opiate to stop the pain. And if you are an opiate coneisseur, they are all not strong enough anyway. 

But it worked wonders for my initial localized pain of unknown origin. And then as an every day filter over whatever I may or may not feel.

359^SensitiveCortex^dreams^It means you think about him being your TF intensely enough that it is true even in the dream state. Looks like it doesn't reve much truth about him though, since you haven't met. It might show that you both accept being Twin flames, although that can't be sure until you meet him and then have more dreams about him. 

I used to get dreams in which men I was with would show me the "real" selves. By which I mean their (and on a deeper level mine) aspects I was choosing not to see in real life. The sweetest guys would prove to be unreliable and avoidant in the dream world. While the most uncomfortable karmic relationship , in dreams shows me many faces, none of which is that negative. 

The man I consider to be my twin flame, in dreams tells me he will meet me at 11 or otherwise is hard to meet. In yet another dream he got my attention by very precisely saying my full name, like an official. In another one we were in bed, but not getting it on... I sometimes wonder if I could at least have him in the dreams. But dreams do reflect the inner reality of some sort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
360^murules1^opiates^Vyvanse junkie here, 

Vyvanse‚Äôs effects are pretty much indistinguishable to Adderall / Meth / Coke.  Extreme focus, interest, and pleasure gained from any task, no matter how trivial or boring. If you sit down for 5 min you will get extremely restless and bored. There‚Äôs also a constant flow of adrenaline,  that kinda keeps you on edge and makes it hard to sit still. As a result your heart beats faster, your blood pumps harder, and doing simple physical tasks (like running or climbing up stairs) can be extremely difficult. I basically have no appetite and the thought of eating makes me sick. Food feels dry and flavorless and like your body is rejecting it. Eat a nutrient dense meal before taking the pill to ensure you won‚Äôt have a bad comedown physically if you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat. Hearing ringing in your ears to the point of deafness or getting extremely dizzy are common. Strangely though in this mindset the head rush you sometimes get can feel immensely pleasurable. You can try to trigger the rush yourself if your curious by laying down for 10-15 minutes and standing up really quickly. It only really happens to me when I take 100+mg but since you have no tolerance maybe that will do it for you It‚Äôs weird as fuck, but in a kinda indescribable way it‚Äôs oddly pleasurable. 

The euphoria is extreme. Probably the strongest of any substance I have ever tried. You just feel this wave of relaxation and stimulation constantly flowing throughout your body. You love yourself and the world and everything around you and become extremely confident and social. Socially and academically this is actually pretty dangerous because to be honest it totally does make you like the perfect version of yourself (to you and to others) which also feels really good. These are all of the wholesome emotional effects though, and the ‚Äúrush‚Äù or ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù that people are usually chasing is very hard to describe. If you‚Äôve ever tried weed or opiates I would describe their euphoria as ‚Äúwarm‚Äù, but amph euphoria feels more like this smooth, cool, buzzing of pleasure in your head. 

The effects kick in around 30min, and peak at 3-4 hours. From that point the effects will slowly ramp downward for 8-10 hours until your pretty much back to normal. I wouldn‚Äôt expect to be able to sleep though, as I‚Äôve done the math and learned the lesson over and over and over. You can not sleep until 16-18 hours after dosing. This is super fucking annoying, but there‚Äôs no way around it, (except smoking a shit ton of weed or taking a Xanax or something) so you just have to comply. 

Fair warning though, before experiencing this I didn‚Äôt even understand addiction and could always easily and control and pace myself with no problem. But the fucking second I started to feel this feeling go away when I first tried Vy I IMMEDIATELY took more. Later after trying real speed and shit I realized I actually like d-amphetamine (what Vyvanse is converted to) more than I like regular amphetamine, and so do a lot of people. This also means though that Vyvanse is more addictive to me than meth because it‚Äôs my DoC. Also I started to understand why people snort drugs because having to wait 1.5h for each pill to take effect is a big problem when you are stim fiending and just need something in your system now. Now, over a year and a relapse later I am still helplessly addicted to and dependent Vy. So have fun, be safe, and most importantly be VERY CAREFUL about
your usage. It‚Äôs easy to think that because it‚Äôs pharma and just a pill it‚Äôs not that dangerous but it is literally one molecule off of meth and in my case even more addictive.

Oh and also, never mix alcohol with like anything. It has a fuck ton of interactions, and most of them are not great.

360^murules1^opiates^While overdosing on opiates most of the time you don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on or even if you do you don‚Äôt care at all and barely feel any pain, physical or mental, because the drug just numbs you completely to that level of emotion or sensation. Your father had a peaceful death.

360^murules1^opiate^Look like Klonopin 0.5mg‚Äôs. Got the same pill with the same symbol it‚Äôs pharma just yellow not blue. If this is Oxy and you weren‚Äôt just scammed with benzo‚Äôs (dunno if opiate dealers do this) then they‚Äôre definitely presses. Proceed with caution.

360^murules1^opiate^Really shitty dirt cheap bud sprinkled with a very small amount of fentanyl basically just feels like a stronger, more addictive version of weed. 

Also drug dealers are always willing to risk killing their weed customers in an effort to turn them into opiate / cocaine addicts. Turns out hard drug addicts spend a loooot of money on drugs/

360^murules1^black^I can never tell if people are kidding when they say shit like this cuz I figure if you actually did heroin you wouldn‚Äôt call it ‚Äúblack tar heroin‚Äù but also why would you say this if it wasn‚Äôt true

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
361^DM_Me_Im_Bored^toys^When I was younger Go-Gos were big at my school, they were little plastic toys that you'd use in battles by flinging them at each other. Each one had a number symboling rarity, 1 being the highest.


Now I was super into Go-Gos and had all 5 different shiny 1s, I was basically the coolest kid in school,and one day at home I thought it would be a good idea to send them all out on a mission to spy around the house for intruders.

Unfortunately they never made it back from their mission and have all been lost somewhere in my house :((

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
362^ZealousPsyche^china^What is this Farenheit 9/11? The CDC wouldn‚Äôt fuck around, and we aren‚Äôt China (that is if you‚Äôre referring to the USA).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
363^alanalan123^opiate^Would have to go with MDMA hands down. Took vyvanse to study during finals but never a big enough dose (max 60mg) for euphoria, and the only opiate I've tried has been Hydrocodone syrup poured up like lean. I was nodding off but the experience was a bit too "boring" for my taste.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
364^Acidmonkey69^opiate^You are correct, brand name is dilaudid, street name dilly. Supposedly the best rush of any opiate from IV, shits gonna be a gold rush on Hastings. Personally try to avoid opiates as I know I would let them ruin my life, but will be interesting to see how it reacts down there. I personally hope there is lots dispensed as many addicts will sell them if they have enough, meaning it‚Äôs saturating the market more and someone who occasionally does opiates is more likely to get their hands on that, as opposed to a fent press. However, my hopes for that are low, but optimism is key

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
365^Daniel9364^opiate^Happy mix? Every post on somebody doing Xanax coke meth and any opiate and not ripping it is negative af

365^Daniel9364^opiate^Lol obviously I'm saying do all drugs all the time. I'm saying we should cut down on saying you're going down a slippery slope or you're going to get addicted when anybody makes a post on enjoy coke, an opiate any benzo and even weed sometimes

365^Daniel9364^opiate^Yeah guess so but seems like you can't make a post about enjoying an opiate, benzo, coke and meth without everyone saying you're going to get addicted

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
366^ijswizzlei^black^This is child‚Äôs play if I have 15 minutes I can nut to a black screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
367^insomnomo^opioid^So this isn‚Äôt a way to ‚Äúlower opioid tolerance‚Äù directly through receptors, but gabapentin potentiates the fuck out of everything, especially opioids, while remaining a very safe drug that is near impossible to OD on and has almost no sedation or intense effects when taken alone. If you like weed it also near resets your weed tolerance on it, getting you super baked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
368^skoomd1^toys^If even that. He'll probably summon or resurrect her from the "dead" in a couple days. Literally who even watches this shit? Ouija boards are toys

368^skoomd1^opiates^Yeah that's why I never really got into opiates. It would just be so fucking expensive.

370^assblood69^opiates^That is totally ok! Don‚Äôt get me wrong It‚Äôs not like weed made it so I didn‚Äôt have withdrawals... those were horrible but and indica dominate strain definitely helps me with my cravings for it and makes me content with life in general! I‚Äôm keep doing what helps me stay off opiates! Thanks for your feedback there buddy... NOT (in Borat voice)

370^assblood69^opiates^That‚Äôs awesome my friend!! Yeah it kind of takes a lot of weed to help but it helps!! I smoke a few back woods a day to help and it does take a decent amount of herb and cash but I‚Äôd rather spend my money on weed which will last me longer then 2 points of herion! Mind you I live in Montana so hard drugs are expensive but the weed is cheap and it‚Äôs of really great quality!!! Please don‚Äôt pick up the opiates fam!! Its the scum of the earth!! But that‚Äôs for your support it makes me wanna keep it up!! It means the world to me and we don‚Äôt even know each other!! Much love g!!

370^assblood69^opiates^Wow I didn‚Äôt realize how much support, kind souls, and words of wisdom/advice this sub has to offer!! I appreciate everything everyone has said to help me out with kicking opiates right in the ballsack!!! You are all awesome each and everyone of you!! I know once an addict, always an addict... but just from what y‚Äôall have said to me it makes me want to stay sober even more!!!:) it‚Äôs almost overwhelming the support and cheers from people I don‚Äôt even know!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
371^onepoorboi^opioid^This. I prefer to combine it with some opioid to take the anxiety out of the equation. 200mg modafinil and 40mg methadone is the best combo ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
372^CuirPork^chocolate^I moved in with her shortly after being evicted from my place on Castro Street but couldn't stay with her for long because I had an ex lover that would threaten her. So I lived homeless for about six months with no hope of ever getting out of this mess I was in. During this time we kept in touch and I did everything I could to help her, but it never felt like enough to pay her back for saving my life. But then the weight of all that I had lost and the best possible future I could imagine for myself led me to think about suicide.

One night, after taking a couple hits of ecstacy and several hits of acid, I had a terrible experience where my best friend left me at a strange party alone. Everyone thought he was my boyfriend, but he wasn't. So when I asked his friends if they had seen him, their compassion for me was tangible. I didn't understand why they all felt so terrible for me, but I could sense it. They explained that he had gone home with this other guy, which was fine by me. They just thought they were saying that my boyfriend had left me. It was crushing to see such compassion in these people's faces. It made me think about what they were seeing: a homeless, strung out kid whose boyfriend just left him.

So I left the party and started walking. I was crying enough that I remember the headlights of cars passing in the street looked like dandelions. I thought about how simple it would be to just walk into traffic and not have this kind of pain anymore.

But then I was suddenly at the Townsend club that I had designed the logo for. They knew me and the owner of the club grabs me and brings me inside. He gave me a handful of double-stacked rainbow blotter acid in gellcaps. I sat on the bleachers until the club was closed and the owner helped me to the door--really tripping hard.

When I left, I followed my normal routine. I walked down the street to Star Donuts and out of habit got in line. When it was my turn to order, I was too high to figure out what to do. Fortunately, they recognized me and asked if I wanted the usual: Blueberry Donut and a Chocolate Milk. 

When I get to the counter, she rings me up and tells me the total. Now keep in mind, there are cops in this donut shop hanging out. I realize that some sort of transaction is supposed to be happening, so I reach in my pocket to hand her whatever I had..which was about a dozen hits of rainbow acid. I turned my palm face up to give them to her and she lovingly closed my fingers over the drugs and told me that they were on her. She encouraged me to take them and to eat them outside. Which I did.

As the day went on, I grew more and more aware of my lack of hope for the future. And as lazy old suicide was begging me for attention, I gave in to an even more insidious internal voice.

The voice said, "listen, you got nothing to lose right now. Why not go balls to the wall and burn it out?" At which point I immediately swallowed all twelve hits of double-stacked rainbow acid and continued walking around downtown San Francisco waiting to lose my mind completely.

Having been homeless while waking up to someone trying to steal my shoes while I slept, I knew how important leather platform shoes were so I took them off to carry them close to my body. Makes sense, right? 

I could feel my shirt (a metallic stretch material) sticking to every square inch of my upper torsoe and it was driving me nuts, so I took it off and draped it over my shoes which I had under my arm.  My shorts were super comfortable or I have no doubt I would have been naked. 

I started having this reaction to the 30+ hits of acid I was on. I recognize the behavior and was helpless to stop it. It goes like this:

I am really really sad about what's happening and I start crying. But not just crying, sobbing and wretching out of control. But then another part of my brain realizes this and get angry. Slowly it takes over and the tears and sobbing are replaced by flexed muscles, fists clenched--anger. Which when you think about the two extremes is pretty funny. Funny enough that I relax my fists and start laughing. Laughing out loud as hard as you can laugh becuase it keeps getting amplified by how funny it all is. Pretty soon, your sides hurt and you get scared that you are never going to get this under control. From laughter, comes fear and the tears start up. This is a cycle that goes on for a long time, maybe an hour. But each emotion lasts for only a minute or two. You experience this cycle over and over and I honestly thought this was the end. I would never recover.

So I'm in the Moscone Center having this breakdown when I catch a glimpse of this shirtless dude walking towards me. I remember thinking, "he's pretty cute and all, but wtf? He's obviously one of those fucked up crazy people you see on the streets talking to themselves. How does someone get that fucked up." It was this point that I was face to face with this guy and suddenly realized that I was standing next to a mirrored building. I had an immediate out of body experience when I realized that I was there. I was the fucked up guy that runs around homeless screaming and yelling and crying. 

I was instantly sober and realized what had to happen. I walked about 20 feet to a pay phone (we had those back in the day) and dialed my parents collect. They answered and I said simply, "I have a drug problem" to which they were so relieved to hear. They asked if they needed to come out to get me or if I could make it to the airport.

"Not for about 3 days" I told them and told them I would call back.

I immediately went to find my friend that had saved my life. She brushed me off and helped me get it together so I could go home to my family--again saving my life.

I would only ever see her or hear from her one more time in my life. She was doing a lot better, but still "in the business". I tried to express how much I appreciated her but she wasn't the mushy type.

30 years later, I notice she is living back in San Diego. She has a great life with a lot of great friends. I see pictures of her smiling and having fun which I seldom got to see when I knew her. I get the feeling she is off the drugs or at least out of the business. I have sent her a friend request, but have not received a reply. I won't push it.

Sorry for the TLDR;

372^CuirPork^black^I am fortunate to have cheated death more than once. I offer these two examples of where I should have died, but by some miracle managed to live. I have numerous examples, but these are the first two.

Cheating Death - First time: My Birth

My mother was put in a girls' school in Wyoming when she was a kid. She had tried to run away from her stepfather who would molest her and beat her so often that she had to have a plastic bridge of her nose added after he literally caved her face in. While she was there, she had gotten pregnant by my biological father, but since she was 16, they took the baby from her and sold it black market.

2 years later when she got pregnant by the same man, she was 9 months from graduating when they decided to hold her back. She decided that she would rather die with the baby inside of her rather than let them take the baby. So at nine months pregnant, she manages to escape and find someone to hide her for two weeks while she waited for my father to arrange her escape. He was Air Force and managed to sneak her onto a military transport plane out of Wyoming to Abilene, Texas in a jump seat at 9.5 months pregnant.

When they landed, she was rushed to the hospital and gave birth to me. I was 10lbs 9oz and the largest baby born in the hospital that year at 23 inches long. My mother was only 5'2"

When I came out, I came out elbow first and there was no way to reposition me. They literally cut her open from the top of her vagina to just under her ribcage and pulled me out somehow. They then used these horrific clamps that held her flesh together as they sewed her up. She still has this unbelievably jagged scar with dots running up the sides of it (where the teeth punctured the flesh to hold it together) all the way up her abdomen.

During this time, I was without oxygen and nearly died. Even so, they informed my mother that I would likely be brain damaged and would never be a normal child. Fortunately, they were wrong and by 8th grade, I scored 1600 on my SATs.

**Cheating Death - Second time: Miracle Aunt**

When I was about 5 years old, we lived on a farm in rural Wyoming. My father was long gone and my mother worked on the farm. We lived in a little hut next to the barn while the farmer lived in a nice house down the way. The farmer had two really obnoxious, spoiled kids.

One day I noticed these two kids heading for the rabbit cages presumably to see the new baby rabbits. I knew you couldn't touch the babies without having their mother kill the babies or at least neglecting them. So I started crossing the field yelling at them not to touch the babies. As I was getting close, one of the kids picks up a cement clod and hucks it at me.

It hit me just above my eye and I started bleeding really bad (as head wounds tend to do). I was a screamer so it was not unusual for me to be screaming at the top of my lungs. Usually, it was the nasty goat that chased me and pinned me against the barn that caused me to scream, so nobody came to my aid until I got in the hut and my mom could see all the blood.

She tried to stop the blood with salve and the blood continued to just squirt out. She freaks out,  wraps my head in a towel, and throws me into the Jeep. We've got 13 miles to the nearest local hospital. 

When she gets to the irrigation ditch, the ditch is flooded for the first time in memory. There's no way to go around it and since it was normally bone dry, there was no bridge to cross it. She had no choice but to drive the Jeep blindly into the ditch, hoping she'd make it.

When the Jeep's engine was underwater and died, she grabbed me and waded to the other side with me over her head. She was determined to carry me by foot 13 miles. She knew I would likely die, but she had no other options. The farmer wasn't home and there was no hope but she didn't give up.

As my mother got near the top of the ditch, someone grabbed me out of her hands. She didn't know who it was but she rushed to the top to find my aunt. 

My aunt grew up 2 hours away from where we lived and she had never been to see my mother. She was raised by the grandparents and though they were close, it's not like they had cell phones. In fact, we didn't even have a phone and we had no way of knowing that she was coming that day.

My aunt happened to be coming to visit us for the first time when she was stopped at the other side of the drainage ditch, unable to cross. My mom couldn't see her from the other side because the embankment was too tall. 

She rushed us to the hospital and they were able to stitch my head up and give me 2 pints of blood, saving my life.

These were but two of the times that I have cheated certain death.

372^CuirPork^opiate^You are undeniably wrong. First of all,  GHB and its analogs often cause people to bend over at the waist passed out while remaining standing. They seem perfectly normal then literally just slouch over in front of you. GHB is not an opiate.

I can fall asleep anywhere almost at any time. It's not officially narcolepsy, but it has to be close. I have often fallen asleep in public when I was exhausted. 

I have fallen asleep standing up counting money after being up for four days and strung out on meth (not an opiate). Most dealers I have known have done this as well.

I have friends that have acted just like this guy described from alcohol or cough syrup alone.

When I was in the military, it was not unusual for people to fade in and out of a delirious state where they functioned great one moment, then unable to function because they were asleep due to physical exhaustion.

There are numerous cases where someone would exhibit this kind of behavior without being on opiates. 

Like, for example, the exact excuse the young man offered, "I haven't been sleeping well". 

It certainly doesn't seem fair that you are willing to make such a claim without providing a reference that opiates are the only drug that would allow you to look healthy, normal, and exhibit classic traits of physical and mental exhaustion. Seriously--not possible.

373^beachbumklane^black^No pink shirt. Can confirm. Either navy or black. His hair looks great, per usual.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
374^Crimson_Entity^chocolate^Idk I just really was not expecting to get a chocolate starfish in my face when I opened this app, and really, I don't appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Are you sure it's the SSRI aspect of tramadol that makes you feel like that, and not the opioid aspect? Many opioid users I know say opioids are the only thing that makes them feel like a normal person. That applies to me in a huge sense, morphine (or really any other full-agonist opioid) is the only thing that makes me feel comfortable in my own skin. When you feel like that, it's easy as fuck to get hooked. "I want to be like that again 24/7" was almost the exact same thing I said when I first took oxy. I was taken by a huge level of euphoric energy and just walked from the living room to the kitchen and from the kitchen to the living room thinking, "my GOD I want to feel like this FOREVER." One month later I was hooked. Be careful.

375^thelarustatrust^opiates^Oxycodone is not converted into morphine, it's actually converted into noroxycodone and oxymorphone. And "most opiates" aren't turned into morphine either, only a few opioids are metabolized into it, like codeine, heroin and nicomorphine.

375^thelarustatrust^opium^But opioids kinda make you hallucinate in a way, don't they? Although not in the psychedelyc sense. I mean, that's why opium addicts were said to have a dreaming habit. The book Confessions of an English Opium Eater is full of reports of "hallucinations" the writer had while he was nodding on the stuff.

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^In principe, of course it's possible. But very very few people can actually mantain the moderation in the long run. The relief opioids provide is just amazing, it kills all kinds of psychological pain. It fixes everything in this sense. You can use it in moderation for years, and then one day a loved one dies, you lose your job, and you just justify using it more often to deal with the pain. It's hard to not let it turn into a way of dealing with your problems.

Heroin is just another opioid under the sun. Intravenously, it's just morphine with an even more intense rush than regular morphine. But it's illegality makes it more dangerous than pharma opioids, since you never know how much you're taking. If you live in the US or Canada, there has never been a time more dangerous to be a heroin user than today's, given the fent advent. In a way, it's even more dangerous if you use it in moderation, since regular users at least have a tolerance which makes them less likely to OD. Although they also use it everyday multiple times, which in this sense makes regular users more likely to OD. Kind of a paradox here.

375^thelarustatrust^opium^>Maybe that's where the glory lies once your body starts to crave the blanket, the fact that. Everything will pass. The pain, the buzz , the hurt. Its like coming face to face with your own mortality. And having the calm presence of mind to not be alarmed or frightened by the current of life and death.

Dude! What you said made me remember a great article:


"The alkaloids that opioids contain have a large effect on the human brain because they tap into our natural ‚Äúmu-opioid‚Äù receptors. The oxytocin we experience from love or friendship or orgasm is chemically replicated by the molecules derived from the poppy plant. It‚Äôs a shortcut ‚Äî and an instant intensification ‚Äî of the happiness we might ordinarily experience in a good and fruitful communal life. It ends not just physical pain but psychological, emotional, even existential pain. And it can easily become a lifelong entanglement for anyone it seduces, a love affair in which the passion is more powerful than even the fear of extinction."

"When we see the addicted stumbling around like drunk ghosts, or collapsed on sidewalks or in restrooms, their faces pale, their skin riddled with infection, their eyes dead to the world, we often see only misery. What we do not see is what they see: In those moments, they feel beyond gravity, entranced away from pain and sadness. In the addict‚Äôs eyes, it is those who are sober who are asleep. That is why the police and EMS workers who rescue those slipping toward death by administering blasts of naloxone ‚Äî a powerful antidote, without which death rates would be even higher ‚Äî are almost never thanked. They are hated. They ruined the high. And some part of being free from all pain makes you indifferent to death itself. Death is, after all, the greatest of existential pains. ‚ÄúEverything one achieves in life, even love, occurs in an express train racing toward death,‚Äù Cocteau observed. ‚ÄúTo smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving. It is to concern oneself with something other than life or death."

375^thelarustatrust^opiates^People were sourcing for drugs a lot in the dope porn posts, apparently it was out of control. Which is just a shame, I really miss the dope porn on /opiates. Missing dope porn is the reason I'm here on /OpiateChurch lol.

375^thelarustatrust^black^The two things are not mutually exclusive. Also, if Kratom is a dangerous drug, than that's another good reason for keeping it legal, since "there is no drug known to man which becomes safer when its production and distribution are handed over to criminals." "Water would become dangerous if it were banned and handed over to a criminal black market."

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Yes. It saved Switzerland of it's heroin crisis from the 90s and it was the main treatment for heroin addiction in the UK until the 60s, although there are a few haundred british users on IV heroin prescribed to this day, one of them even posted his amps of pure pharma dope powder here on Reddit (if you want the link I can send you). Users who fail at methadone or buprenorphine treatment can get legal access to pharmaceutical heroin by prescription also in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Canada. In Canada only a few lucky addicts actually are on prescription heroin, there are more of them on IV hydromorphone. There's even a hydropmorphone vending machine now for users to take their doses and inject at home, although the opioid vending machine is still in testing phase.

375^thelarustatrust^opium^In the past, I used to drink at least once a week in order to drown my sorrows. The day I tried dope for the first time, that was it, no more alcohol for me. The relief opioids provide me is so much better, so much cleaner, so much more natural than alcohol and it's nasty effects. Thus, I rarely drink nowadays, as in once every two to three years or so. As Thomas De Quincey once wrote,  "I do not readily believe that any man having once tasted the divine luxuries of opium will afterwards descend to the gross and mortal enjoyments of alcohol."

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Several studies have shown that when users get access to prescription heroin, their tolerance tends to stabilize at a certain dosage rather than increase endlessly, and when their tolerance gets stable, then the tendency is for users to voluntarily reduce their dosages rather than increase them. For example:

"Gschwend P, Rehm J, Bl√§ttler R, et al. Dosage Regimes in the Prescription of Heroin and Other Narcotics to Chronic Opioid Addicts in Switzerland ‚Äì Swiss National Cohort Study. European Addiction Research 2004;10:41‚Äì48.
This naturalistic descriptive study of dosages of patients in the Swiss PROVE narcotic prescription program between 1994-1996 found that heroin was most common (77% as injection and 9% as inhalation) followed by oral methadone (usually in combination with heroin). The authors concluded, ‚ÄúDuring the course of treatment the mean dosage for injectable heroin per day decreased significantly and, depending on the treatment regime, almost linearly.. During the treatment period, dosages did not increase but generally decreased, indicating no further increase in tolerance.‚Äù *Dosages declined even when patients chose their own daily regime.*"
- Drug Policy Alliance Annotated Bibliography - Heroin Assisted Treatment

"Concerns that HAT may encourage drug use have proven unfounded. *The EMCDDA and other reviews found that rather than patients increasing their heroin doses, they stabilised and often started reducing them*, usually within two or three months, and uptake of other treatments also increased. HAT also helped reduce heroin availability and recruitment of new users by medicalising use, and reducing street-dealing and the number of user-dealers. Clinics are also sited only where a street injecting problem already exists, and have soon won strong support from the public when their effectiveness is demonstrated, for example being backed by a resounding majority in a national referendum in Switzerland."

I've made a post about it some time ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bukav8/debunking_myths_longterm_heroin_use_is/

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Buprenorphine is usually worse than shorter-acting full-agonists in the physical dependency aspect, since withdrawals from it are just hell. Full-agonist opioids are worse in the psychological addiction sense, because unless you have no significant tolerance, opioids such as oxycodone or hydromorphone tend to feel more euphoric than buprenorphine. They last shorter than bupe too, which adds to their addiction potential. As far as damage to the body, opioids in general usually are almost harmless in this sense. They're not toxic to organs at all, like cocaine or alcohol to give you examples.

I don't know much about tapering. In principle, shorter-acting opioids would be better for tapering since they don't accumulate in the body as much as longer-acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine. But in real life practice very few people can actually follow through a tapering with shorter-acting opioids like oxycodone and morphine, precisely because they feel so good and you just don't want to reduce the dose. You want that feel good feeling, and you want it completely! So if you don't have a doctor gradually enforcing the tapering, but rather are doing the tapering by yourself, it seems it would be usually better to try to do it with a longer-acting and not so euphoric (at least not for people with a significant tolerance) opioid, like bupe.

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Yes, in Switzerland you're required to have at least two years of opioid dependency and at least two prior treatment attempted.

375^thelarustatrust^opiates^"Almost *no one* is getting prescribed dilaudid or heroin for addiction. I know it happens, but it's too rare to be worth discussing here."

Hydromorphone and diamorphine maintenance are getting expanded each year that passes, and are actually one of the most efficient ways to treat serious addicts. So it's definitely worth discussing.

"However, as long as getting high is your primary goal, you're probably fooling yourself into thinking that it can stay an easily managed habit, like having a glass of wine at night."

Well, yeah, it shouldn't be one's primary goal, but getting high indeed is part of life of many people who are on maintenance. They wake up, go to work, come home and nod off. And that's it. All I'm saying is that it doesn't matter at all, and if it doesn't matter, maintenance shouldn't really be defended in the grounds of "it doesn't make people high", because it does make some people high, although not everyone, and it's not an issue most of the time.

"but if you still want to use opiates every night to get high then you're not really in recovery and, more to the point, you're still going to live a life that revolves around the drug "

Wel, as I said, I don't care about arbitrary standards of what recovery is. I care about stability, about improving in life and staying away from crime. If maintenance got me stable and away from street drugs, I may not be clean, but I do think I'm recovered in a very significant sense, whether I get high when I come home or not.

"The other issue is that as long as you chase a high, you're going to have your tolerance steadily go up."

See, this is a myth. Every research about this issue found that the tolerance of people on injectable heroin maintenance stabilizes at a certain point. It gets stable, and then many of them actually decrease the dose. Most of them stabilize at half a gram a day. So of course they feel that great rush and sometimes get high, but opioid tolerance tends to stabilize. I have a whole post quoting all the research about this issue:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bukav8/debunking\_myths\_longterm\_heroin\_use\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bukav8/debunking_myths_longterm_heroin_use_is/)

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Many people prefer diazepam over alprazolam actually. I don't like benzos, but I myself think Valium is just as good, or maybe even more relaxing as far as benzos goes. Klonopin I just kinda hate tho, such a long-lasting benzo and particularly uncomfortable.

As for the huge buprenorphine doses, the purpose is to fill all opioid receptors in the brain so that the user can't get high on junk. I would never accept such a thing, because I know I can't stay away from junk and being on such a huge dose of buprenorphine would just make my tolerance skyrocket for no good reason.

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^I've read an article about doctors prescribing morphine sulfate for IV use as a maintenance tool to a few problematic users in France. I fully support that. I've also read that heroin use went down in France after the quality of the drug went down and the price increased in 2011, so that many users switched to morphine because it gives an effect similar enough to heroin when injected and that only some old users actually kept using H. That remained the case even after 2013 when purity increased again.

That made me think that France finds itself is in an interesting scenario right now. They could expand the injectable morphine maintenance thing to more users and keep the opioid problem in control in most part (as Switzerland did with it's heroin maintenance program) or they could restrict access to morphine so that it will be scarce, and thus heroin will make a strong return to the streets of France to supply the demand of users who have lost the access to morph, and thus ODs will increase.

It's up to the government to do the right thing, but they don't do the right nor the wrong decision, they just let the situation (which as it is may be controled) stay the same, which is dangerous. As someone who actually lives in France, what do you think about that?

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^Naloxone indeed is an opioid blocker, but buprenorphine has a higher affinity to the opioid receptors than naloxone. Naloxone just won't work, it can't compete with bupe.

375^thelarustatrust^opioid^I'm an opioid addict. I'm stable on 90-120mg of IV morphine. It gets me high for years. I don't need to increase my dose ever, at all, although I do in very rare instances. I'm not talking about chasing a high. My point is that IV opioid tolerance gets stable, as it's proven in the link I provided above. If you're stable in a dose that makes you high, you don't need to chase it. It's stable. That's what happens with most peole on IV heroin maintenance. They get high, but their tolerances stabilized. They don't chase a high or "push further," because they're stable.

375^thelarustatrust^opiates^"I don't think I can become addicted because where I live all you see is fucking crystal meth never opiates"

I thought there was plenty of heroin in Australia, although very expensive.

376^inamortax^dreams^The guitar has nothing to do with it, it's the melody Juice is singing in. Listen to the Yellowcard song and sing Lucid Dreams at the hook. It's incredibly similar my guy

376^inamortax^dreams^Huge Juice fan but you‚Äôre insane if you think Lucid Dreams and the Yellowcard track have no similarities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
377^bigfucknyikes^opiates^Oh yeah, okay. I‚Äôm tracking now. Yeah, if you‚Äôve had any kind of psychotic episodes psychedelics probably aren‚Äôt the best idea unless you‚Äôre doing them under the care of a trained professional like your therapist. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through it darlin‚Äô. I can‚Äôt speak to the ketamine thing because while the research I‚Äôve done has shown nothing but incredible results I haven‚Äôt tried it personally, I‚Äôve just done a TON of research. The FDA here in the US has just recently approved a form of ketamine - esketamine - in a nasal spray for treatment resistant depression but I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs actually been prescribed it. The studies do look VERY promising though. There are a ton of ketamine clinics here that do IV infusions for depression but none are covered by insurance - not like everyone here can afford insurance but that‚Äôs beside the point - so there exorbitantly expensive & your average person can‚Äôt afford the thousands of dollars it costs to access that treatment. Aaaaand now I‚Äôm just rambling. 

I‚Äôm so glad you have one doctor you can be completely honest with because that‚Äôs absolutely crucial, it sounds like your therapist is amazing. I‚Äôm sorry your GP was dickish, but at the same time I can understand why he would be concerned about you self medicating your mental health issues with opiates because that‚Äôs a HUGE indicator of active addiction or that you‚Äôre headed toward active addiction very quickly. Regardless, I‚Äôm super proud of you for having the balls to be honest with your medical team & for TRYING to get better, whatever that looks like.

377^bigfucknyikes^opiates^I have questions, if you don‚Äôt mind? When you say your doc didn‚Äôt react well when you told him you‚Äôre essentially self medicating your mental health issues with opiates, what exactly happened there? Because it sounds like you‚Äôve been honest about it with your psych & that doc is at least trying to help you be as safe as possible, so what happened with your other doc & what does that one specialize in? You mention getting your meds from a pain clinic so is that one your pain mgt doc? 

Secondly, when you say your psych prescribed ketamine as a treatment for your depression, when was that & how exactly did that go down? She just wrote you a script that you filled at your regular ol‚Äô community pharmacy? I‚Äôm super curious about this & I‚Äôve never known anyone that managed to get their doctor to get on board with ketamine treatments, not even the most severe cases of treatment resistant depression with some of the worst suicidal ideations ever & it‚Äôs incredibly sad tbh. 

Lastly, have you & your psych considered ECT? I know that‚Äôs an extremely drastic last line therapy but when it‚Äôs that or the patient offing themselves.. Or have you tried microdosing psychedelics? I‚Äôve heard truly AMAZING things about the effects of microdosing both LSD & psilocybin - not both simultaneously of course - but I can‚Äôt really speak to that personally because while I‚Äôve tried it with LSD I wasn‚Äôt super consistent & I didn‚Äôt dose volumetrically - I procured the lowest dose tabs I could find [they were either 105 or 110 microgram Gammagoblin tabs] & cut each tab into 16 pieces & ingested one piece the first time & then a piece & a half the second time, but with them being on blotter paper there‚Äôs really no way of knowing exactly how many micrograms were on each piece, so I really should have gone the volumetric route. Anyway, I say all of that to say that I didn‚Äôt really notice a difference because I was so inconsistent & didn‚Äôt follow any kind of dosing schedule, my two doses were months apart. But I‚Äôve really been thinking about giving it another go & being consistent with it this time just because I‚Äôve read SO much about how helpful it is with treatment resistant depression, because like you I‚Äôve been on every antidepressant known to man & nothing has helped. At best they just make me into a zombie that makes me easier for everyone around me to tolerate but they don‚Äôt help me feel any better & I‚Äôm so far past being done with making myself into a fucking zombie just so other people are more comfortable.

377^bigfucknyikes^opioid^Benzos are such a godsend in hospice care, especially the longer acting ones. When my grandmother was at the end of her fight with cancer she got downright combative & had NO idea what was going on around her - she didn‚Äôt even recognize us anymore - & the benzo & opioid combo were the only thing that kept her comfortable. 

Also, I feel you on the dad thing. I lost mine unexpectedly four years ago next month, two days after my birthday, no one has any idea why because they didn‚Äôt do a full autopsy - they just called it natural causes & left it at that - & even though everyone says it gets easier, it hasn‚Äôt. It still sucks just as much as the day I got the call. You aren‚Äôt alone in those feels friend. üñ§

377^bigfucknyikes^black^That‚Äôs a very kind thought, thank you. This shit with the DEA has created a whole new demand for black market opioids.

377^bigfucknyikes^opiate^I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, especially with you being so young. 

Unfortunately the chances of her medical team taking any suggestions from you about which meds to use or doses is pretty much nonexistent. I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs unconscious? If so, they‚Äôll base their case off of signs of pain like her respiratory rate & any verbal cues & muscle spasms & such. There‚Äôs a fine line when someone is opiate naive between properly treating their pain & pushing them over the edge which can lead to a malpractice suit. 

With that being said, your best bet is if you see signs that she‚Äôs uncomfortable like what I mentioned above, say something to her nurses. The nurses are who will go to bat for her, rarely the doctors because they only see her for a few minutes at a time.

378^iPukey^black^Or maybe he thought it was deprecating to call yourself black, and they're the racist one. "Noo man, you're not black! Don't say that. Be better than the haters"

378^iPukey^black^I have a list of episodes I really enjoy that often get passed over. Hopefully some of these speak to you. I have descriptions for each one. 


Episode 50 Halloween spooky story extravaganza!- really their best scary story episode. All the guests are their friends so they're funny as fuck.

Episode 78 Lord RayEl- this guy is just so fucking funny. The episode borders on bullying but they guy is such a piece of shit it doesn't really matter. It's about a self-proclaimed messiah and it's unique among their subjects as he's very much current and active.

Episode 93 Gnomes! -Birth of terry the gnome is really the best part.

Episode 112 Gangstalking- sooooo fucking funny.  Very very underrated. I have used the episode to convert multiple friends.

Episode 119-20 Satanism in the Government part 2-3 the Franklin Cover-Up- this episode is very disturbing but very interesting. It covers pedophile rings in the government.

Episode 139-140 Edgewood
This is perhaps the best conspiracy episode and mandatory listening. I truly love it also. Absolutely fascinating. Very well documented as having actually happened, this is the story of the government experimenting with many drugs, but mostly pcp and lsd, on unsuspecting US soldiers


Episode 151 horrors of the U.K. - birth of Spring Heeled Jack. not so much a sleeper episode but many people don't know it

Episode 152 the Dylatov Pass incident- very spooky and very interesting. This is an A+ unsolved mystery and the boys bring in some solid takes.

Episode 156 The Coronado Group abduction - one of, if not my all time favorite alien episode. Gary is one of my favorite lpotl creations. Very very funny. Also mandatory listening.

Episode 169-170 the Betty and Barney Hill abduction- the first time Stanton Friedman makes an appearance. This one is also right up there with the Coronado, and Henry very delicately voices a black man, which is in its self very funny.

Episode 171 Serial Killers of the American Frontier - I can't remember the name of the characters, maybe the harlet brothers? Anyway that portion of the episode is very very funny. Especially when they meet the river pirates. Truly evil old fashioned rednecks. I used this episode to convert my dad.

Episode 187-188 The Dulce- facility a very goofy and very funny conspiracy theory episode, and one of my most frequently relistened to episodes. "What are you guys talking about?" "Uhhhhhh tacos" 

Episode 193-194 Son of Sam- easily my favorite serial killer episode- at least until the modern episodes. "This guy's seeing bloodsucking vampires and Frankenstein monsters. And this is coming from a guy who's seen a mummy."  The first parts a real quote from a policeman. The second part is Henry. Listening to Henry do New York accents and ripping on disco makes this episode very, very fun. Plus you learn a lot about Henry's dad who was a corrupt ny cop.

Episode 209 David Bowie and the Occult- very fun episode documenting David Bowie's magikal life and practices.

Episode 214 Chemtrails- this ones just full of characters. So many idiots to make fun of. "Aunt Martha... aunt Martha... can we finish watching Spider-Man 3?"

Episode 215 Paranormal photography- just a fascinating little number and full of fun debunked and undebunked photographers. It's actually more about the photographers than the more famous photographs you may have seen.

Episode 217-217 Rosewell- This ones not such a sleeper either but it is very fun and a good introduction to many of the famous ufologists the boys mention. A research heavy alien episode.

Episode 223 Witch Hunts- this is another one of my all time favorite episodes. In regards to a book on witches: "they only got one page on killing crops. But they got *5 pages* on stealing penises. " Stealing penises is really the main theme of this episode. Let me say it again- one of my favorites. One of the funniest.

Episode 239 Billy Meier- this guy is one of the biggest doofuses ever. He claims to be be in contact with aliens. He's obsessed with cowboys. He has one arm. No one believes a word he says. He beat his wife. Don't you want to hear three podcasters make fun of him for an hour?

Episode 242 Time Travelers- just a fun episode about some time travelers and some conspiracy thrown in. 

Episode 252-253 The Gulf Breeze Sightings- another alien episode. This one stars a guy from Florida with hilarious pool filter problems and guest stars a trio of mufon investigators who take turns shitting in buckets in the back of a van.

The episodes get more well known from here on out so I'll only do a few more.

Episode 279-280 Einfield Poltergeist- this is a great ghost episode. Not only is it compelling, it also has Henry doing U.K. accents and some hilarious characters

Episode 281-282 Jerry Brudos- this guy is such a loser. Serial killer known as the shoe fetish slayer. Has a heavy lisp. As pathetic as they come. 

284 Travis Walton- possibly the most accessible alien episode due to hilarious characters and the fact that not much suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy it- that is if you're not a believer. Loggers, it turns out, are incredible subjects for a character actor. "That just trucker humor mixed with construction worker humor" "THATS WHAT LOGGERS ARE! Truckers mixed with construction workers!"


And that's all folks! The episodes after this I'm sure anyone could tell you about. I'm gunna have to save this for next time this question is asked as I doubt anyone will see it.

378^iPukey^china^My favorite line from this song is "I miss her broken china voice"

There's so many meanings. First off, it's a great description of a voice. Rough like shattered glass. Scratchy. But then it's also the idea of something beautiful and delicate, but totally broken and ruined.  Then there's the idea of her asking for forgiveness. Her voice after a fight maybe, where she broke the china. Or maybe it was an accident, but now she's asking for forgiveness.

If I keep on and on I‚Äôm going to be an old man that‚Äôs addicted to opiates that literally wasted away his youth. It hurts me a lot too bc I had a great childhood and teenage years. I didn‚Äôt really become an addict until I was almost 20. Before that I was great in school, had many friends, talked to girls every other day, was a star athlete. I even had tryouts to a big college for soccer and didn‚Äôt even show up the first day because I had gotten high and drunk the night before. My dad had sent a video tape in to the coach of me playing in high school and he told me to come out. My dad is still disappointed in me for that, I‚Äôm sure. I look back and wonder if my life could have been so much better had I just stayed home that night. I was hanging with the wrong crowd at the time. Then I lost my mother and my girlfriend of 8 years in the same month. That‚Äôs when I really fell off. I pushed everyone away and would just lock myself away with oxy and video games. I‚Äôve literally not left the house except for work or groceries and the like for probably five years. I‚Äôve lost all of my friends and don‚Äôt even want to pursue a relationship. What‚Äôs the point? I think about different ways to kill myself daily but I just can‚Äôt, because I‚Äôm a coward.

379^darthvegito^opiate^I‚Äôve never tried that so I can‚Äôt speak on it. But as an opiate veteran, I can say with absolute conviction I wish I had never tried it. All it took was one pill and I‚Äôve been enslaved for ten years. I‚Äôm about to be on day three and I feel like I‚Äôm in hell. A cold, flu like hell with the walls closing in. If you ever think ‚Äúmaybe I can try just one to get a buzz‚Äù do NOT do it. I beg of you.

379^darthvegito^opiate^How would you recommend taking that? I‚Äôm a pro in the opiate game but a compete noob when it comes to stuff like that. From what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs a plant found in Africa and other different places. I googled it for ingestion and it‚Äôs showing me seeds. Sorry for sounding like a moron but I have no clue what to look for lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
380^NefariousK21^opiates^Oh amen to this I‚Äôm right there with you. Strangely I use to be a clean on adderall person, but got into opiates more and it definitely changed to wanting to clean on them. Also, enjoyed cleaning on Xanax sometimes!

380^NefariousK21^opiates^Do you feel the same for norcos and opiates if you‚Äôre a user? I strongly believe there‚Äôs a discrepancy in manufactures

380^NefariousK21^opiates^Not even under NSFW? Or anywhere on site? Or just under Opiates? I‚Äôm new not trying to break rules

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
381^yeldarb207^china^Chinese are some of the most racist people, if you‚Äôre not Han then you are an ‚Äúother‚Äù to them. The CCP is literally trying to exterminate all minorities in their country through actual genocide and through destruction of culture and heritage. To them China is for the Communist Han and nobody else, and if you stand in their way you‚Äôre gonna get bulldozed over.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
382^rhysees_pieces^black^Black females commit suicide at a rate higher than any other demographic, and that‚Äôs a good thing. 

Just IMAGINE if someone said something like this. Discrimination towards ANYONE is despicable. Even if they‚Äôre a majority race of a country

382^rhysees_pieces^black^South Africa in a nutshell. White people = bad. Even though they‚Äôre trying to help. Apartheid is over, get over it. Trying to do the same thing over again with the roles reversed doesn‚Äôt make black people any better. South Africa is gonna end up just like Zimbabwe. Don‚Äôt hurt the hand that feeds you.

382^rhysees_pieces^black^They kicked out white farmers for basically ‚Äúhoarding all the land and stealing it from black people‚Äù. Sometimes would have them executed and their land seized. The country then went into a famine because all those ‚Äúevil‚Äù white people who were kicked out weren‚Äôt growing or producing food anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
383^psychedelic_jesus420^opiates^Nah man.  When you on meth your eyes dilate it‚Äôs a stimulant. Opiates constrict.

383^psychedelic_jesus420^opiates^1 fake pint because i don‚Äôt know much about lean besides it‚Äôs trash and not worth a fuck because I do real opiates. I put the fent flair on every post I make of a press because I actually know what I‚Äôm doing and don‚Äôt pretend I‚Äôm something I‚Äôm not. And you can‚Äôt iv a syrup you fucking idiot.  You are a sad little man

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
384^BostonsDrugsRBest^opiate^You. Understand. Me. End of story, it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always come back her. Opiate family ‚úä‚úä‚úä

384^BostonsDrugsRBest^opiates^Lmao same here bro. I don‚Äôt do any opiates for his exact reason. It‚Äôs all fent n it‚Äôs sad bruh

384^BostonsDrugsRBest^opiates^Hahaha I feel that. I get hit up 247 with bud pics cuz I grow. Not enough of my grow boys do opiates tho unfortunately.

384^BostonsDrugsRBest^opiates^I love this sub too man and I feel you on the double life. I was the only one who knew I was using for years other than my dealer. It‚Äôs a lonely life for sure and can make scoring drugs a fucking nightmare.

Also I found that once my plugs all disappeared I got into kratom. Not sure if it‚Äôs legal in your area but it helped my WD a ton. You can order it online or buy it at local bead shops. Def. or as good as opiates but a hell of a lot better than being sober or sick.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
385^creepylynx^incense^Honestly i would try and sit down, meditate and try and communicate with him. I don‚Äôt think anyone other than yourself can learn more about him. Light some candles, incense and just focus on the energy. Practice doing that once or twice a day. Try and form a more open communication relationship with him

385^creepylynx^opiates^What‚Äôs the criteria for being put on suboxone? I‚Äôve been through treatment before, although not for opiates specifically just drugs in general

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
386^Miselfis^gum^That‚Äôs the most American thing I heard today lmao. That doesn‚Äôt work in Denmark, where I live. Apparently they have every right to do so. It‚Äôs actually illegal to have stuff that looks like drugs. If you have white powder (even if it‚Äôs like baking soda or something) in a baggie you could get charged with possession of a controlled substance. And because I had gum in a baggie, it looks close enough to drugs and therefore they had every right to kick me out. 
Laws are strange.

386^Miselfis^black^That happened one of the first times I smoked. I took a couple hits off my homemade apple bowl. I get super dizzy, so I start to freak out. I knew weed couldn‚Äôt kill you, but I kept thinking I was gonna be the first or maybe I had some kinda allergy to weed. I laid down on the couch. And I was super freaked out and paranoid. Then everything slowly goes dark and I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúhere we go. I‚Äôm about to die. ‚Äú. At one point everything except a little blurry dot in the middle. I though that was the light in the end of the tunnel, everything was talking about. Then everything goes black. And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyup, that was it. Now I‚Äôm dead‚Äù. I remember having a dream with a lot of shapes and colors. And I remember kinda dreaming that I saw my body from the outside, and I thought that I had become a ghost or something. 

Then light slowly comes back, and I hear a ringing noise. Everything becomes lighter but it‚Äôs all blurry. Kinda like when you stand up too fast. Everything started getting clearer and the ringing in my ears slowly went away. 

I was so confused. I thought I died, but somehow getting revived. I thought God had given me a second chance. But then I remembered that I wasn‚Äôt religious. And I realized that it felt kinda similar to a time I fainted at the dentist (lol), so I looked up if you could faint from weed. So I found out I didn‚Äôt die, but faint.

386^Miselfis^opium^Well, tobacco is also a plant. So is opium. So is cocaine. 

Also, weed does contain a lot of chemicals. But it‚Äôs all natural chemicals. Not man made. Everything contains chemicals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
387^evilrabbit99^china^Yea no shit. The USA is basically the most influential country in the western world. Your politics has a huge influence in europe too so I am not surprised foreign people care about the impeachment.

Saying you don't care about other countries isn't right. Maybe a lot of americans are ignorant and somehow take pride in this but for a lot of americans the stuff happening in the EU and china is also quite a big deal. 

Idk why you act like we are jealous of the US and that this is the sole reason we follow US politics. It is not. Like I said the USA plays a HUGE role in international trade, climate change, geo political war and it is one of our biggest allies (as an european). If your president decides he wants to go on a trade war with china or an actual war it influences us too. If america decides it no longer cares about global warming all humans will experience the consequences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
388^One-Strain^opiates^I know that opiates don't work this way. I thought the picture of the dog itself was funny. I posted it here to possibly give people a laugh. I didn't mean to cause all this freaking drama. Jeez, I mean, bashing someone who only wanted to make people smile for a second is pretty shitty. All these comments are really just not necessary. I know I suck already. I don't need it pointed out repeatedly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
389^RyuSupreme^dreams^I finally stopped smoking a month ago after daily use for about 5 years and I can say that every single night I've had intense vivid/wild dreams. After watching 1917 and saving Private Ryan in the same night I had a dream that the amusement park I was at got attacked by a drone strike and everyone fled to the amusement park across the street to keep the fun going (like wtf?) I've also had many people that I haven't been in contact with for almost 10 years or people I've only met once be in my dreams but I know for a fact it was them. I had this other one where I absorbed this blue light into my palm which gave me the ability to fly and blast lightning from my hands! I then was able to pass the power along to all the neighborhood kids and they were all jumping in the air and doing flips with roller blades on üòÇ

389^RyuSupreme^black^I just tried doing the install and after I rebooted my quest before starting the game up the first time I got the black screen glitch :( Oculus home never appears but the guardian and controllers still worked but everything else is all black. Had to do a factory reset to fix. Not sure if it's Lambda related or not but just thought I'd put that warning out there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
390^Sohrey^hops^Dxm microdose (45-120 mg) would add warmth and euphoria, and would inhibit enzymes increasing the anxiolytic effects of most benzos. I like to mix mild herbal anxiolytics with my benzos, including valerian, kava, chamomile, passionflower, ashwagandha, and hops

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
391^IveGotNoValues^opiates^As a very anxious 22 year old guy who someday wants to try psychedlics, this post definitely makes me wonder if it would be a good decision or not. I can‚Äôt even smoke weed without feeling panicky, so it would be quite a gamble for me.

I feel your pain though, I really do. Anxiety has consumed me since I was just a young kid. I self medicate with alcohol, nicotine, and kratom. Those are my big 3 vices (not all at the same time lol). They keep my anxiety manageable. I like opiates alot, but have no friends really so no plugs, probably for the better. 

Id suggest you try your best to go see a doctor about the anxiety though. It‚Äôs really not easy to do. I basically had to force myself to go a few years back because I was having constant panic attacks for a month straight. They put me on shitty Lexapro but hey at least I rarely have panic attacks now.

391^IveGotNoValues^opiates^Wow I can relate to this post so much its crazy! All my life I have REALLY wanted to enjoy weed like everybody else but I just can not. Everytime I take a hit off of my girlfriend‚Äôs vape I think maybe just maybe this time will be different...it never is :( 

It triggers my anxiety lile nothing else. Makes me feel like I am losing my damn mind. The only time I can sort of enjoy it is if i‚Äôm already drunk. Coke, opiates, anything else that I have tried I am having a great time. I just can not conquer weed, kind of funny that such a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù drug brings me to my knees lol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
392^MilTownBucks414^opium^It will be something different that we haven‚Äôt even thought about think about it.  Each drug they made was supposed to be non addictive and fix the other drug. Opium > morphine> diamorphine>oxy >??

Who knows what is next.  We could say Bupe but that is a MAT. I will be interested to what next addictive substance they use for pain that is addictive but marketed to cure pain and opiate addiction lol.

Ideally they make all drugs legal though.

I know people will say they have created new opiates but I‚Äôm talking something on a mass scale that is addictive that scientists exploit for the name of capitalism and gets the government backing as non-addictive lol.

392^MilTownBucks414^opiate^True that! I just hope I am old and they just leave my ass on it. All the old people with fat opiate addictions right now... super jealous lol.

My last  grandma that is alive is on 80mg op oxy. BID ( twice a day) and 4-6 oxy 30s a day as needed for pain. 180 count. Plus her 2 mg bars once a day. It‚Äôs sad but I know the day she dies I‚Äôm going up there and clearing the cabinets. She got bottles of shit. 

Getting sober in the next week but I know I‚Äôll relapse whenever she is gone or sells the house and wants to clear her old shit out.

392^MilTownBucks414^opiate^Haha true. I am hoping we see something else. I feel like tramadol got fucked due to the overall opiate epidemic. I think we will see something different and better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
393^thatjunkieoverthere^black^Fuck them. I‚Äôll help you out bud. 

Benzodiazepines are anti-anxiety medication.  they‚Äôre good for withdrawing off of alcohol and other hard drugs and can help with seizures and muscle spasms. They work **extremely** well for anxiety, but are **very very** addictive. Where I‚Äôm from from they‚Äôre called ‚Äúfelony in a pill‚Äù because you take too many you black out and do dumb shit. Also, for some reason they make people want to steal? But. Benzodiazepines are klonopins, Xanax, Valium, Librium, Ativan

Edit: don‚Äôt start taking them. When you get physically addicted and you withdraw they‚Äôre **deadly**. Also, they make your anxiety 10x worse when you get used to taking them and stop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
394^Buddypeterson^opioid^Facts. I feel like I realize how big of a deal the opioid problem is but she just thinks it‚Äôs a pill by a doctor so it‚Äôs all cool, unless some junky is stealing it from there grandma then they‚Äôll die after one pill. It‚Äôs kinda a double standard. But she grew up (and so did I) with everyone saying every drug is bad and can kill you or ruin your brain. She also worked in the ER for a bit and has seen the worst case scenario for stuff but thinks all drug users are like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
395^konqrr^opiate^That's not how it always starts. Some people aren't lucky enough to start off by their own choice. Some people put their trust in doctors who they thought knew what's best for them. Then after a month taking pain killers at the doctor's prescription they're suddenly cut off and they feel horribly sick. But hey, their friends have pain killers and it takes away the sickness. Suddenly there is a war against opiates and doctors aren't prescribing them like they used to. Now it's almost impossible to get pain killers. But hey! Heroin is the same thing practically, it's an opiate. If I sniff it then it's not such a big leap, but I'm only going to sniff it, never shoot it. A few months down the line and either there isn't enough money to buy more or there is a drought at the moment. I need to make the rest of this stash last. Well shooting it has a much higher bioavailability and it'll stretch out the remainder of my stash. Then as soon as I get more I'll go back to sniffing and never shoot again. So its shot up and then there's no going back. Congrats, now there is one more person stuck in the vicious cycle!

395^konqrr^opium^People might think I'm crazy, but Thailand. The 711's sell a cough syrup that has opium in it for about $1. Tramadol is sold in almost all pharmacies. These are the legal opiate highs. Now people might say Thailand is super strict on drugs, but not from my experience. At least it depends where you go. Some more remote areas of Thailand have there own law system it seems. One island I was on there was a bar that sold hard drugs over the bar counter... meth, coke, heroin, ecstacy, molly, etc... the island was "owned" by one man. He was the "big boss" of the island, everyone answered to him even the police and his relatives owned the bar. They would sell to anyone but sometimes the police would extort foreigners: they would search foreigners that just bought drugs and basically tell them its 10,000 baht to go free ($333). If you couldn't pay it you'd go to jail... and the police wouldn't care if you said the bar is selling drugs, lowkey they know. But I was really chill with the police on that island by the end of my 5 month trip I was drinking whiskey at the chief's house. Thailand is the craziest place I've ever been, things happen so fast and the absolute craziest shit in my life happened during that 5 month period.. so crazy that people think I'm making up the stories so I don't tell them... but man, thailand is like a lawless country if you're in the right areas and know the right people. Like lowkey (or maybe more people know than not?) it's where wanted Russian criminals go to run from the law in their homeland, it's where Swedes go to run shell companies, it's where European millionaires hide their illegal millions... like there were so many millionaires that couldn't take there money anywhere off the island so they had the absolute sickest parties. There are sex shows practically in the middle of the road and that's the legal part so you could imagine the illegal shit rich people get away with. If you have money in Thailand you could buy anything. Shit was wild.

396^Iseith31^black^i'm somewhat concerned about the black spots on this cacti. I cut the mother up a couple of weeks ago and I only noticed now some of the cacti have these black patches that are developed/developing on them

396^Iseith31^black^damn man wouldnt have been able to tell, for anyone else who needs specification to avoid sarcasm, i'm somewhat concerned about the black spots on this cacti. I cut the mother up a couple of weeks ago and I only noticed now some of the cacti have these black patches that are developed/developing on them

397^callof_thevoid^opioid^This opioid crisis will have affected multiple generations. I am sorry for you and your kid's loss.

397^callof_thevoid^opiates^I am here to applaud your willingness to change. Recognizing the effects opiates had on your life is a great start. That life that seemed out of reach for you is now in view. Congratulations on your decision to start the journey to recovery.

397^callof_thevoid^opioid^Yeah, sounds like deception, Opana was super potent. It is a full agonist opioid active at the Mu receptor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
398^BAM_SpiceWeasel^dreams^I mean the heaviest part of the trip was about an hour-long but I honestly can't remember the hour after it happened except trying to walk to my friend's car. I felt like it was all a really bad dream and that I was gonna wake up eventually just didn't know when. 

It's still incredibly hard to kind of reimagine what it was like because it was completely debilitating. I'm honestly scared that I might have some form of permanent brain damage. Sometimes I have dreams where someone will inject me with some sort of drug and I feel like I'm tripping again and it's super hard to wake up.

 I keep also getting really delusional ideas and a weird kind of Deja vu. Like I'll sometimes think that I'm tripping still lying on the floor somewhere convulsing all over the place but my brain has deluded me into a false sense of reality making me believe I'm living a dream but when I dream I'm tripping and that's when I'm actually awake.

 The Deja vu part is super weird too I'll learn something new and then delude myself into thinking I've known for a long time when I just learned it. Might be an effect of the trip's time dilation, I already feel extremely old for my age not in a mature way but rather that I've seen a lot of things that others will never experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
399^EyeInEl^china^Yeah, its around. Its common in Dublin. It can be easily got, but the open air market isn't as good as was back in 2010-13. The quality is good though.

China White sometimes...rare now, though.

402^MostLikelyHasADHD^black^There is a really cool black one and sand coloured one you can unlock for free in the challenges, you get a total of 4 legendary skins for her if you buy the battle pass and complete the easy challenges...id say thats fair.

402^MostLikelyHasADHD^incense^I use house smells for my anxiety, essential oils, incense, so i can understand how this may work for some people. Glad you found something that helps!:)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
403^Bmoneysmug^incense^Yep it sucks. Honestly, when it comes to recreational weed in Illinois, you‚Äôre much better off with wax. You can get a full gram of high quality wax for around the same price as a half gram cartridge, and if you‚Äôre a beginner you can easily get a decent wax pen or rig for $20. Plus the high you get from wax is way stronger and more full spectrum than the high you get from carts. Only downside is that you need to periodically clean your piece, and the smell is somewhat strong (it doesn‚Äôt necessarily smell like weed, more like a cross between skunk and incense, but the smell dissipates within 30 minutes).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
404^dctravel24^china^‚ÄúWhat I would do is not blithely assume Asia is all one interchangeable place‚Äù

Did you not read the news about 2 confirmed cases of the virus in HCMC from a Chinese man living there being infected by his father who travelled from China?

Have a great day :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
405^majestic_12inch^china^You're moving the goalposts. No-one said anything about entering the economy from overseas, I was talking about a free market within China - because we were comparing states it makes no sense to suddenly start talking about global trade.

I don't know what you mean about "lack of oversight because they can't". 

You obviously have never visited any quasi-communist states like China or Vietnam, I have visited both and I can tell you that they have a much more free market than Europe or the USA.

I never said China had a right wing government either, what are you on about?

405^majestic_12inch^china^China, like most "socialist/communist" states is not really communist - it just has a government that calls themselves communist. If anything it's more free market capitalist than the US.

405^majestic_12inch^black^Me and a mate were talking in work about making a short film, called "420 days later". We did a basic screenplay of the opening scene, here's a summary:

Fade in to two guys smoking a joint on a bridge, just making everyday stoner chit-chat (no reference to zombies/apocalypse or anything). The camera slowly pulls back to reveal dozens of zombies below. 

Cut to a POV of one of the guys passing the joint to the other. He suddenly says "watch ya back mate!". Receiver of the joint ducks out of shot to reveal an approaching zombie behind him.

We hear some giggling, the sound of a sword unsheathing and the zombie is decapitated by an medieval broadsword. 

Cut back to a portrait shot of the original smoker, now with blood spattered over his face and the sword he is brandishing. "Shall we send him off in style?" The second stoner giggles again, turns the joint around, puts it in his mouth and gives the headless zombie a blowback into his bloody neckhole. We see the smoke get sucked in. The zombie does a little dance, spins around and flops off the bridge before splattering onto the ground below.

More giggling, fade to black. Title and opening credits roll.

406^117308^opiates^Could be a migraine. Sometimes you can get a migraine without actual headache pain. Opiates can easily cause this in myself.

406^117308^opiates^Sometimes. I usually reach for Kratom when I am really craving opiates and want to relapse and it helps curb that for a bit. But bc I‚Äôm an addict, I quickly get hooked back on Kratom. Now I‚Äôm full time back on it for 8 weeks now and I need to get off. Have done it several times and I seem to never learn. Do you regret finding Kratom ?

406^117308^opiates^Oxycodone, fent, hydrocodone... any and all opiates. I am no longer a daily user of these but I crave them daily and they seem to make me not feel so intensely all the time. It numbs me, but when it wears off all hell breaks loose and I have a full blown panic attack. I wish I could take them everyday. It seems like it's the only way I can actually "function" in life. Are you currently using?

406^117308^opiates^Lol well congrats on getting clean! That is never easy. Clearly. I can never seem to stay sober for too long. I think about it all day everyday. Going thru a break up and I relapsed last week with opiates. I have been on kratom for 8 weeks now. I have gone thru the kratom cycle a few times. But for some reason I can't stop taking it now. I would rather be numb than deal with this break up.

406^117308^opiates^I‚Äôm so sorry you are going thru this to. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone :( I have came off of opiates and that was really hard to get off of and getting over this dude feels like that but worse. I feel so lost and nothing is helping me cope. Im glad you mentioned the ‚Äúlet them go‚Äù and that‚Äôs what I did. He never deserved me. He was a real POS. True colors came out after a couple weeks. Narcissist. Thanks for making me feel not so alone!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
407^HmPorn^black^I did, she acted surprised and denied everything. This was back in Oct 2019, a week ago I found a black knot in the bathroom, about a week earlier I found an empty black plastic flap that had failed to flush down the toilet. I will try talking to her again but I really want to find something and have it tested first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
408^thinkB4WeSpeak^china^Well Japan was in both world wars. The first world war the took over a German colony island near them. 

Africa was involved in both world wars. Especially WW1 as colonies and their inhabitants fought each other. /r/thegreatwarchannel has several episodes about it.

WW1 the Ottoman Empire fought the British empire in the middle East.  This was a major front in the war. 

China fought Japan in WW2 and tied up Japan's expansion a great deal. 

India was involved in both world wars and their help in WW2 was what helped with their independnc.

Edit: I forgot that several South/Central American countries were involved in WW2

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiates^Opiates in my experience kinda dull psychedelic trips for me. I‚Äôd recommend saving your dope for if either things get too intense, or for your comedown.

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiates^Opiates always kinda mellow out my psychedelic trips in my experience, so it depends if you want a more mellow trip or not. Personally, id save it for the comedown, they help a lot taking the edge off for landing from your trip

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiate^If you are opiate naive or have no tolerance, kratom can be pretty nice and give you a mellow opiate high somewhere around codeine IME

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiates^I worry that as a retaliation to the ‚Äúopioid epidemic‚Äù the overprescription of subs is fucking tossing gas on the fire here and honestly going to increase the amount of people addicted/dependent to opioids by quite a bit. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, subs can, and have helped quite a few people fight addiction, and it has its place & uses, but prescribing 24mg a day to someone who abused a bottle of Vicodin or people who aren‚Äôt even addicted to opiates is going to have so many consequences down the road here. The pharmaceutical industry is so fucking wretched; they contributed to this epidemic, and now they‚Äôre doubling down on the monster they‚Äôve created

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiates^Yeah no problem. Loperamide can definitely help quite a bit, but it really depends on your habit and what kind of opiates you were doing. A light oxy habit and they‚Äôll take most of your WDs away, but if you‚Äôve been doing fentadope they might not even touch it.

Good luck

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiate^Loperamide is the active ingredient in Imodium that you want to be looking for. It‚Äôs actually an opiate but it doesn‚Äôt pass the blood brain barrier, so it takes some of your WDs away and helps with the stomach issue. Doesn‚Äôt get you high unless you take doses that reach into territory of potentially fatal damage. I haven‚Äôt messed around with different types of magnesium but just any old supplements have worked for me.

409^dirty-filthy-peasant^opiates^How long have you been using opiates for consistently? Are you physically dependent?

If you have zero tolerance and no physical dependency, subs can get you a little high, I‚Äôm not sure exactly how they interact with kratom thought

But yeah if you are physically dependent on opiates, and take subs before you have withdrawn enough from opiates, yes it will put you into precipitated withdrawals

410^what_is_serotonin^opiates^I remember getting home from school, going on bluelight, sniffing pills and reading Benadryl reports. I'm glad I'm off opiates now, but damn the nostalgia!

Why was bluelight taken down, anyway?

410^what_is_serotonin^black^That's always my go-to, spacing them out. My regimen for dxm almost feels like ritual, which imo makes th experience feel more sensual o:

I'll boil some water, get fresh ginger root and skin it, cut it into cubes, put those bitches in a mason jar with some of the boiling water, shake it for like 5 mins, then strain and use the ginger liquid for tea (usually just plain black tea with some honey), then I drink it slowly when popping 5 pills x 10mins, sometimes every 5 minutes if I wanna get up there

The ginger tea is literally such a godsend for nausea, but nothing, not even some nice dabs, can ever get me to not gag when eating them. I had a really good trip on 60 gels (900mg, I'm pretty sure) and was vibin, until I had to shit. When I got off the couch (I was a lump on the couch before having to use the bathroom) and get *every* gel inside my stomach. It took 4 seconds for me to waddle-run down the hallway and promptly like my guts out

I was even planning on taking a 480mg trip tonight, but I don't think I can do it quite yet ;-;

Edit: I made it to the toilet, should have specified

410^what_is_serotonin^black^I love sitting on my bed in near pitch black frying off 600mg smoking a blunt and playing ESO; there's not really much that can top that if you can get the synergy right

410^what_is_serotonin^black^Sorry, I guess that was my fault lol

Whenever I got down and dirty with DMT (once I Vaped 85mg from a rig, and that's actually the trip that made me say this), I was panicking so much and was looking at all these different machines, entities, and realities as if they were giant mirror-like things that I could walk into (think the Super Mario 64 paintings and how you can jump into them)

Bit by bit, the room began to dissolve; tiny little cubes of my immediate vision began to break off and evaporate, until my vision was black; just me and pure Oblivion. It was at that point that i didn't realize I hadn't breathed for what felt like hours, and quickly began breathing fast as to "avoid brain damage due to lack of oxygen"

I have no clue what it looks like from a sober perspective, but when I smoke DMT, my friends/sitters all say I like to hold my breath for a few seconds, let it all out, then hold my breath again; and the higher dosages I Vaped, the longer I held my breath. It wasn't so much I forgot how to breathe, moreso that it felt like looking at what I was being shown was more important lmao

Also the words "please" and "breathe" kept echoing (more like a word vortex; anyone that knows what thinking on DMT is like will know what I mean), and in no particular order. Strange trip, but good advice :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
411^Serotogenesis^opioid^Keep it under 400mg. There's a serotonin aspect to the stuff. Makes it weird cuz some people think it's a bottom tier opioid and others think it's the king depending on how they handle that side of the effects.

411^Serotogenesis^opioid^Exactly! Our brains being chemical supercomputers we can tweak with one of a dozen neurotransmitters is so. fucking. cool!

This is gonna sound dumb in this sub but I'd never actually played with Kratom much. I've been kinda chilling on a lot of drugs besides weed, occasional alcohol, ritalin, and K. But I just discovered my head shop sells kratom at a half decent price and have been loving the dichotomy of low dose being stimmy and high dose scratching that opioid itch.

What've you been getting into lately?

413^brattysubmissive19^black^Wow.

Thankyou for wording that so well.

Seriously. I find it difficult to see/realise/get that side of things, that im teaching her that she is destined to be an addict with how I say things.

I can never think clearly in the moment, my emotions always overwhelm me. I have very black n white thinking. Drug are bad so the only other choice is no drugs...

I'll have to have a deep ,soul searching think to myself tonight....
Thankyou thankyou very much for your reply. It was very thought provoking for me...

I was almost going to finish with a sarcastic or flippant self-deprecating  remark, but I'm going to say Thankyou, from these Aussie ladies, Cheers mate xx

414^BlueOxyCult^opioid^Maybe we will live to see the day that they discover a highly euphoric, around the clock opioid that doesn‚Äôt raise tolerance, and has no withdrawal symptoms. 

May we all shit like everyone else when that day comes.

414^BlueOxyCult^opiates^About 50k. Give or take. But most likely give. 

We used to spend upside 75k to 100k per year. But I was working in the oilfield, she was an assistant to a millionaire family, and we also made good money selling various substances.

We both have different careers now that pay a bit less, the opiates are more expensive and less abundant, and we do our best to only use on 2 of our 3 days off (we work together now). 

If it wasn‚Äôt for divine intervention of the ignorant opioid crisis, and the ups and downs of the West Texas oil fields, we would still be balls deep and possibly dead.

414^BlueOxyCult^opiate^I have used every pharmaceutical opiate, and some RCs, and I can confidently say that Opana via snooter is legit the highest I have ever been.

My tolerance is extremely high, and 60mg of intranasal oxymorphone did me good. Almost too good, if you feel me.

I can‚Äôt get Opana anymore, but my favorite opiates and ROAs in order are 

Opana intranasal
Dilaudid IV
Oxycodone Intranasal 
Fentalogues Intranasal
Hydrocodone Oral

Other shit like Codeine, Nubain, etc. I either don‚Äôt have enough experience with, or just don‚Äôt care for.

415^SirSaltyThe1st^opiates^That's a really good question and thanks for the feedback!

For me personally Methadone allowed me to get my life back on track without worrying about scrimping for opiates.

I started doing positive, productive, and creative things again.

Yes the withdrawals are worse and last longer but I was more prepared for them with hope for the future.

I think it depends entirely on your mindset.

415^SirSaltyThe1st^opiates^It was sooo hard mate. So freaking hard. But it was the best thing I've ever done! Feels so good to finally be free from those pesky opiates. I had a big monkey on my back for a long time.

Thank you!!

416^ben42187^opioid^I mean bro if you're doing carfentanil no opioid is going to break through that and give you the same feeling it's just that simple

416^ben42187^opioid^As is true in the opioid world as is life..... All good things must come to an end

416^ben42187^china^The problem with this one is going to be that the precursors to make this are going to be illegal so you're not going to find it widely distributed are made in labs in China

416^ben42187^opioid^Methadone is not a blocker. The reason why it is so hard to break through with other opioids on methadone is because of the strength of methadone. I guarantee you asking me IV fentanyl or carfentanil addict if it'll break through methadone and it most certainly will. You just have to find an opioid with a higher potency and intrinsic activity then methadone

416^ben42187^opiates^S*** man it took me 20 years to realize the opiates are probably the most overrated High there is

416^ben42187^opiate^Yeah benzos were great in withdrawal if you want to get addicted to benzos and trade an opiate habit for more hellacious benzo habit. I've been an opiate addict for 20 years and I still don't understand why people think that there's a free lunch with opiates. There is no free lunch with opioids

416^ben42187^opiate^I did not taper I cold turkey. I was on 50 mg a day for a decade. I had had enough and walked out. Today is day 302 opiate free and I've never felt better and more free. Once you guys get over your fear and put the clinic behind you in the bulshit you will be too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
417^iammyowndoctor^black^Truth dude, I know exactly what you're talking about. I mean to be fair, eyeballing little amounts is one thing, but as I'm sure you know, a lot of dudes seem to be literally trying to max out how much dope they can load in the syringe, like you know where they got the plunger 90% back, so far you can barely reach it. And even worse those fools who judge the strength of a shot by how "dark" it is. Like, they don't get that the cuts make it dark not the dope...WTF lol. Dumbass who take perfectly good powder and add loads of sugar to it and fry it to make imitation shitty "black tar" heroin that taste more sugar-sweet than heroin bitter.

These low down, Harm Reduction-estranged dope heads I hung out with in Central Ohio, I mean these guys took the cake for fragrant disregard for all common sense, not just safety precautions. They reused rigs 10+ times, shot crack with lemon juice without so much as boiling to sterilize. The worst part was, it took me almost 2 years to unlearn all the trashy stupid as fuck ways of doing it I'd learned from these shit-heads (to be sure, not cause they were opi-heads, only cause they were trashy as living fuck).

The crown jewel? You believe this? Ear wax to help get your plunger sliding properly in the barrel of the syringe.  That's what my dear junkie buddy, the charming,, sexy af closeted 19 y.o. super-twink Ryan Pratt, taught me to do as a way of coping with rigs reused to the max. Ryan who went to rehab out of state every 6 months, like you know, as the program was set up for regular relapses and detoxes in a perpetual cycle like that huh? Ryan who cheated me every chance he got. Ryan who if he ever went to prison would have been the most desired guy in the place over night with tough guys offerring him weed and dope left and right for his love and affection, I have no doubt. Yep, I really should've gone for him, miserable and stupid af as he was. 

Ryan, all 120lb of him, bragging about how he took a 0.5g shot last night and didn't OD. Hahaha. Nevermind the subtext, which is if you  ever even feel the tempted to fit 0.5g iof dope nto a single syringe, then your dope is likely weak af (it was, and dirty af).

Lol sorry, its true though he was like super hot at 5'6 120, short brown hair and nerdy glasses and whispery dope fiend voice, not to mention his dead fucking laugh. What a guy he was. Ryan! He's probably dead now anyway, shame he didn't learn how to do dope from some smarter dudes

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^There's a dude on r/opiates called u/captainfentanyl who literally does have a permanent IV port for drugs. Dudes an opioid scientist, an expert, his comments are proof

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^I know were aren't supposed to mention this, but thing is, I do have personal experience here. I shot loads of H, meth, coke too to an extent. And yes I've done H and meth combined in fact, that's what I dedicated today to, seeing if I could appreciate how these ODs occur (see, I've never ODed for whatever reason, not in 10 years of doing this on and off.

It might be the initial rush with meth and H involves a boosting of the opioid aspect high enough that it over powers the stim effect...

I've defimitely still experienced noticeable resp depression with speedballs (not to dangerous level I mean) so maybe it is possible, idk. 

My last shot for example 25mg meth, 40mg heroin (this heroin is maybe 40-50% pure) that provoke a shockingly strong sedative effect, I didn't move for a 10 min at the peak, but yeah, my level of consciousness was enough that I could simply will myself to breathe if I thought it was getting too shallow.

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^That's true, but with meth and heroin as oppose to coke and heroin, the opioid wears off long before the stim, not vice versa, just saying.

So that whole argument, which I agree is a great theory (delayed overdose) can't apply to meth and amp speedballs as well as coke.

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^River had been mixing dope and coke but it's thought that some unknown 3rd drug did him in when it was added to the mix. He broke down into convulsions which is definitely a sign of Stim od rather than opioid OD.

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^Well, isn't more likely that a good fraction of ods are what you might call, "semi-intentional suicides" by which I mean the person likely was depressed and somewhat suicidal, and they were "dancing with death" by taking as much as possible, but they weren't necessarily set on trying to kill themselves? Knowing heroin users, I think this explanation is more likely in most cases--people just don't give a fuck if they live or not. 

For the record, you non-recreational opioid users might not know this but, it isn't really quite as easy to OD, even on street heroin, as people make it sound. I mean the precautions required to prevent OD, they aren't very complicated to follow, a monkey could do it, but still a huge fraction of users don't have a clue harm reduction is even a thing, so, loads of lives are lost over basic lack of caution, and it's chalked up to users just oding cause that's what they do apparently. 

But yeah, that's kind of bullshit. oding shouldn't be so normalized, with the proper measuring tools and precautions t's extremely easy to avoid...i know people don't want to believe it but it's true....

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^Was it the high potency powder like they sell on the DN (or did, AFAIK)? 

Cause I got these tiny packages of the most insanely strong powder is ever seen. It was so strong you could ingest just a little barely visible speck and get a moderate level fentanyl rush off of it.

It's a heavy and very peaceful high but it's over with so quickly in like 2 hours tops to get you back to baseline, and you'd get withdrawals as early as 4 hours after taking without redosing it or another opioid.

I've never smoked that fent or any other fent thou, honestly. I suppose there is likely a system out there that could make this more viable,  for the moment it would not appear to be a very reliable method of administering fentanyl. So I wouldn't try though I've dntr it myself other ways.

I would advise you that fent is an extremely fast actually narcotic and that even taken Sublingually, for example, it will kick in with an onset not too far behind what you get snorting or smoking it.

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^LMAO wow that's hilarious. But yes you are, just realize you need to ensure that when mixing any drugs that potentiate each otherits vital start by adding in the second 2nd drug at a snails pace, with breaks to let it absorb, so that you can accurately determine what level of intoxication you can expect. After that you can have at least some confidence that the same two drugs will potentiate each in the same way if you take them the same way..

For god's sake, don't even think about trying to up your established safe max dose unless you have back up in the room with you with narcan handy should the worst happen. 

Just use common sense OK? It's really not that hard to avoid oding in reality, not at all,you can get supremely fucked up and then some before even entering the pre-OD range. Only dummies who dont check their dope before shooting, or try to take a second massively  intense shot of dope after the first one even when they already missing out. 

In other words. Don't be a part of *this* problem if anything, please? Bigotry applies to drugs as much as race, gender or any other parameter, and opioid related ODs are the number one excuse used by hateful assholes to justify treating addicts like sub-human garbage. 

Can you do this for me guy? I know you have the smarts. Promise you aren't gonna go and OD like you don't have a clue what you're doing? Tell me you're gonna always take care of these things smart and do your research before making an big decisions on whether to partake and if so with how much, OK?

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^Yeah this advice is spot on I know from experience. In fact yesterday, for only the second time in the last 365 days, I scored a relatively large sack (large for what I usually spent on it if and when I do, which isn't so much anymore as I've realized it isn't very cost effective compared to suboxone or kratom, and thus you'd likely be a fool to use it anymore than in special occasions, like the one I'm celebrating ATM.üòâ 

It was some refreshingly straight dope though for real, just the diamorphine with likely just one innocuous cut, a plain white powder with a strongly bitter taste recognizable to me as the unique dark chocolate tang of #4 heroin, the HCl salt that is. Nothing to make me suspect fentanyl and I've had no problems taking more than intended as of yet, even though I've been piling it on pretty heavily (I'm cautious to nit leave anything up to chance, I've got 7 years of using this stuff to various degrees, on and off, on my belt, and I haven't had an incident yet where I required hospitalization for overdosing. 

It cooked up nice and clear which was a relief, as you really do NOT wanna have colors showing up in your injection solutions ever, it always means impurities, garbage you wish they'd ain't subtracted from the weight of the dope they sold you, so you could have totally pure heroin for once...

I asked my dealer for $60 worth of heroin this time. As well I bought a 20 sack of some of his consistently fire ice. It's been years since I've bought that much smack in a single sack. Usually I take suboxone daily which actually gives me a moderate high, but since Meth comedowns can really suck, and I'd like to give the Meth an extended break after this anyway, I figure it's be cool to have this time at least for the meth comedown which can be a butch.

I figured it would be nice for a change to be able to summon the **Hammer of Heroin** to smash any uncomfortable sensations into dust. It's been so long since I've done a year ago at least, I'd almost forgotten what it felt like compared to suboxone. Turns out it's much the same in quality of effect but if course can be more intense in terms of the quantity of effect. 

Anyway. Good stuff. Stop hating on heroin for things that are only tangentially related roheroin's actual innate properties. 

Like understand that dirty street dope is much worse for you just for being laced with all kinds of bullshit no one asked for. Understand you don't just accidentally OD if you're keeping my a tight tab on your consumption as you should. 

Realize that you've basically been set up to suffer all kinds of negative consequences just for liking opioids by society and those wretched self-fulfilling prophecies they'll try to stick you with..
Like when they tell you if you use H at all, you're definitely gonna die of an overdose, like someone did today, you have to do the right thing as I did and tell him to fuck off with the condescending fortune telling and the prophecy of doom. 

The truth is even with the whole fent/RCs situations as bad as it is, you can ensure you do not OD while using heroin simply applying the proper precautions. Most ODs are not really caused by insanely ovrerpowered fentadope, more often than not the victim just adopts this line of reasoning without actually have a real clue what they took. But rather than actually being superpowered in the legitimate sense, as with something like pure lab grade fentanyl, something I had the pleasure to own in minute quantity for 3 short days several years ago. 

Yeah did I mention pure fent is very safe when volumeteically dosed? 

Anyway, OD victims are lying most of the time when they claimedm they got something resblibf pure fent in the street. Personally I've never seen anything even close to from my local drug dealer really. The strongest I've seen on the streets was a n RC opi that was about on point with pure diamorphine in terms of potency. Sadly it had a few extrabside effects--more itching, nausea, and more of a chance of triggering a headache in high doses than H. 


The first time I did 40mg if this batch, it was with a nice 20mg ice redose (I had to wait for the suboxone to flush just a little bit out of my system before I could achieve that super strong opi high subs can't quite reach under any circumstances. Of course I started small and worked up to gauge how strong my H was.

I got to say that shooting a proper speedball, done as a rare treat, is a really enjoyable and oddly fascinating experience. I feel that it's bad reputation isn't necessarily deserved. It's really not at all some inherent death trap like media won't have you think. Not even close.

I'll admit that, damn, for a sec I was actually a bit scared that it was too much....Id forgotten what IV heroin felt like more than I knew. It turned out that the dose was actually quite safe for being so intense--i had no more than trivial respiratory relaxation never lost consciousness. It felt in a bizarre way almost like the Stim and the opioid together were creating like a kind of anesthetic effect as a third element on top if each of their own. You feel like this "vortex" of "dopamine fog" swirls up and explodes with this spike of irresistable serenity that swallows you whole. It's honestly different what from you'd expect it to be in many ways.

 My dealer hooked me up, giving me 0.450g for my $60,, nice considering it's $20 per 100mg for small retail samples like Id typically buy if I did at all recently before I first came back to for one night a month ago or s

Anyway they trial and error I estimate that 40mg of thus dope would constitute 

The closest I ever came was when I once passed out in my car in a parking lot while coming home from my dealer, having boy TV ht meth and this cruddy rc dope (yard to say if it was fent another one, it had a weird almost spicy flavor I remember and wasn't all that strong, but wasn't totally weak either. It was the best I could find at that MO.ent. 

relatively high purity for street at maybe 40-50%.

417^iammyowndoctor^black^What it was, is a patient committed suicide. Zoloft got a black box warning for that and still got approved, IDK why they didn't do the same here. Frankly obesity is enough of a suicide contributor that the risk likely would have been worth it overall, long term.

417^iammyowndoctor^opioid^2-3 days of relatively heavy use is the minimum. The best thing you can do to prevent it is to make sure you give your body long enough to totally clear the drug after each period of use, in order to start to build tolerance you need a constant level of some opioid effect to persist for 3 days straight usually. Fent wears off fast so it should be easy taking mini tolerance breaks with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
418^Clipsymuscle^black^The next thing I remember is Titty pulling up to me and Barf in his blue truck about half way down Boonie‚Äôs street in the middle of the night and yelling at his brother, something about his girl, and then skidding his tires and skirting off. As he drove away I do remember seeing his gf in the car with him, so I was confused.  Next I somehow left wherever I was and ended up back at my house which was about a 25 minute walk from Boonie‚Äôs.  At this point I was told by my mom that I was standing in the kitchen at around midnight babbling random sentences and words to people whom I thought were standing there in the kitchen with me.  Apparently I still thought I was with the friends I was with earlier, and I repeatedly swore to my mom that they were standing right in front of us.  I vaguely remember thinking cigarettes were floating in the pool in the backyard but In the morning when I checked it was only dried leaves. I also remember seeing spiders crawling on the pebble ground around the pool and I shined a light on them to see them close up. I remember these very vividly. Black, shadow like, long legged spiders, like a cross between a black widow and a daddy long leg.  According to my mom who was the only person home at the time I left at around 2am and she watched me walk to the curb outside of the house and lay down on the curb at the edge of the culdesac. She was not so concerned about me because it wasn‚Äôt the first time I had come home in the middle of the night super fucked up saying weird stuff, so she brushed it off as me just being blacked out drunk and went back to bed. Luckily I must‚Äôve been out of delirious fuel at this point and my zombified body fell asleep right at the edge of the driveway.  I woke up at the crack of daylight to my neighbor shaking me on the ground.  He was saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù And he had a look of surprise or distress. I think I just walked away and went inside and went into my room and I may have taken a nap during this time but the next thing I remember is when my mom barges in my room and says ‚Äúwere you with Barf last night? He‚Äôs in the hospital, he doesn‚Äôt know his name.‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm thinking fuck what the hell and I‚Äôm just trying to piece things together in my head.  It really felt like nothing even happened after dollar tree, but then I remember walking with him to rite aid, and Titty pulling up and yelling at us. Then I say something like where‚Äôs Titty? And I run to their house which is a half a block away to find Titty and Barf‚Äôs mom outside looking mean.  She asks me what the fuck kind of drugs we did last night.  I told her straight up we all took hella Benadryl and she doesn‚Äôt believe me.  She says they just got back from the ER and the doctor pumped Barf‚Äôs stomach, and he seemed fine to go home. But when they got home He started tripping out again.  I ask her where Barf is and then I hear him talking inside so I run in.  I ask him who the fuck are you talking to? And he says Andrew, which is his cousin who lives 70 miles away. I calmly tell him Andrew‚Äôs not here but he insists that he is, sitting right in front of us all in a chair.  At this point his mom is freaking out and crying and I ask her where Titty is. She says asleep In his room and I say something like ‚Äúgood.‚Äù  Then seeing that I can‚Äôt handle the crying and craziness that was happening in their house I leave and walk or run back to my house frantically to see my mom waiting outside with another neighbor.  She‚Äôs freaking out kinda because I probably look crazy and because Barf and Titty‚Äôs mom is freaking out calling her still.  At this point I look and see my step dad‚Äôs truck in the driveway and ask why he‚Äôs home on a Friday and my mom and the neighbor both tell me it‚Äôs Saturday. Standing there in disbelief and confusion I reach for my phone in my pocket to no avail- I reach in my other pocket for my wallet which is gone too. Along with my mind I must‚Äôve lost all my shit also.  

I must‚Äôve went back inside at this point when I realize I probably hadn‚Äôt called my girlfriend in a really long time, which was a pretty big deal back then.  I grabbed my house phone(this was 2009) I called her and she was, of course, pissed that I had been ‚Äúignoring‚Äù her.  I swiftly snapped back at her and made the accusation that she had not called me, whilst remembering that I still had no idea where my phone was. She hung up on me and I called her back and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right there‚Äù before she hung up again. I quickly half skated half ran to her house almost falling multiple times and when I got there she was pissed.  She started crying and asked if I was cheating on her.  I said no, and just told her I took some pills from dollar tree and got really fucked up and that Barf was in the hospital.  She knew all of the people we were with Thursday night, and Tittys‚Äôs gf Bones was a good friend of hers.  She wasn‚Äôt really buying the story so I told her I would take her out to lunch to make up for it. We decided to go to the beach first. Very bad idea. The Benadryl trip was yet to be over.

So we live near San Francisco, about a 30 minute drive. We smoked a blunt and drove into the city and parked near the embarcadero, which is right off the bridge.  I took a nap on the way, being still super tired, and along with the weed we smoked I was starting to feel the effects of the Benadryl again.  We decided to take the muni transit busses and trains down to ocean beach, so we got on the first train which was a really loud rackety ride.  Somehow during this ride I thought my cousin Alex was with us, and this really freaked my gf out because she thought I was joking at first.  His continued except it rotated through different people, from people I was with the night before, to people I hadn‚Äôt seen in ages, I saw them, IN THE FLESH, right there with me on the bus.  I absolutely positively believed they were there and saw them with my own eyes, or mind.  This is the most scary thing that‚Äôs ever happened in my life.  When we got to the beach, it only got worse.  The sounds of the crashing waves, the sounds of the wind. The people talking in the distance.  All of these sounds transmitted through the sound waves and into my brain as voices of people I knew, friends, family members.  It‚Äôs like I saw them there, in my mind, or felt their presence without physically seeing them.  A very odd, unmatched feeling.  My girl had to be super freaked out at this point, and I must‚Äôve done some shit that I can‚Äôt even imagine that day.  

I only remember bits and pieces about what happened after this, but I do remember that Barf and Titty‚Äôs mom cut them off from me, but Titty and I remained friends for a few more years.  Barf never forgave me. Apparently he, too, was talking to people he thought were in his house for the remainder of the day also. He never touched drugs again after this day, not even weed.

I went on to try massive amounts of acid, shrooms, ketamine, and dxm, but nothing compares personally as far as entering another dimension or dream world for me. One of the craziest drugs in the world right there on the shelf for a dollar. What the fuck

418^Clipsymuscle^opiate^You probably won‚Äôt die from heroin or other hard opiate withdrawal, but you will want to and you will feel dead inside once you come down. Fentanyl is a whole ‚Äònother monster, unless you can get the patches then don‚Äôt fuck with it. Shit will kill you regardless.

419^chiefsfan317^opiates^We WILL fully recover if we stick with it no matter what. Our brains will heal with time but I‚Äôm fully convinced now that exercise speed up the process exponentially. I‚Äôm hooked on lifting weights now and can‚Äôt wait to go the next day. I‚Äôve been to the gym one full week and I can already tell a difference in how I look. People at work have noticed also, you know how good that feels emotionally when someone says wow you look different in a good way. Everything is feeling pretty good at this point. I‚Äôm going to keep going and never look back, I‚Äôve got too many plans for my life for opiates to keep holding me back.

420^barsandshit2^opiate^Agreed. They treat it like it‚Äôs some amazing mind blowing drug. Like sure it‚Äôs cool but if you‚Äôre bragging about a joint can‚Äôt imagine how you‚Äôd react to MDMA or an opiate

420^barsandshit2^opiates^normal, itchiness and slow heart rate is normal with opiates. 

you took 1/4 of a 30mg oxy? no way you're gonna OD...just relax.

420^barsandshit2^opiates^Oh ok. yeah thats on the higher side for someone new to opiates. yeah when you take too much you'll get sick/throw up...don't go to sleep and make sure you're sitting up. stay awake until you feel better

422^shalean^opioid^Was it prescribed ? But either way it‚Äôs better to obtain these drugs legally so you know what your taking is legit rather getting stuff that is cut or these pressed 30s. It would be a great society if the government could completely stop access unless for severe medical issues, but that isn‚Äôt the case and most likely it will never ever happen. We‚Äôve learned that with alcohol prohibition and the marijuana laws.

And I‚Äôm not saying that these laws are inherently racist today, but it started with an explicit bias towards black and Mexicans. And the entire world followed the America‚Äôs steps after these drugs became illegal, look it up man. And tell me why either crack epidemic so many African Americans got locked up but now with the opioid epidemic ‚Äú, which consists mainly of white people, explain why they aren‚Äôt getting incarnation the same rate. It because when these laws were coming in to place they knew blacks made up the urban areas where they purposely over policed. 

Portugal‚Äôs decriminalization proves that having it decriminalized is inherently safer then having it be illegal. Your argument doesn‚Äôt make sense.

422^shalean^china^Ik this probably would never happen but if the government made safe injection sites they can also have a testing facility there to test how pure your product is, what the drug is and identify any kind of harmful cut in there, that‚Äôs what I honestly meant by legalization, not just being able to walk in a gas station and say hey can I get a gram of fat china white haha. But I think we‚Äôre both on the same page when we want this to be a medical issue, not a criminal one

422^shalean^black^I obviously don‚Äôt think that it should be legalized and sold with ease, but they could have alternatives too that aren‚Äôt as strong, for example codeine is legal otc in some countries. With decriminalization we could have safe injection sites like the do in Canada. Instead of the government spending money on law enforcement could be used to spread education, open up clubs/injection sites so people can inject with someone near them to use narcan in case.

I‚Äôm not saying that these drugs laws were inherently made to be racist, but the fact is crack carried a way heavier sentence, and everyone knew who was using crack. Poor black Americans, this was what? Only 15-20 years after Jim Crow was overruled. I just think that we‚Äôve been trying this method for decades now, and it hasn‚Äôt been working at all. Again I don‚Äôt mean full blown legalization, but they should have lighter sentences.

The justice system here is fucked up man. Let me give you an example that‚Äôs actually really close to home with me. My girlfriends mother was raped and choked/beaten, badly. She had the whole rape kit and everything done by the book, had his DNA, basically everyone knew he was fucked. He got a sentence of five years as long as he plead guilty. Like seriously???im not gonna sit here and say ‚ÄúI know people that got locked up for selling weed and get a heavier sentence‚Äù which I haven‚Äôt only ever seen people get probation for that. But with some harder drugs I‚Äôve heard people go 20 years, 10 years etc etc. way worse of a sentence then this fucking rapists got, and this guy had priors, he had a DUI and an assault and battery car. In my opinion I don‚Äôt think someone who sold/trafficked drugs should ever get a sentence that‚Äôs worse then rape. I get that selling drugs is immoral. But it‚Äôs definitely in that weird grey area compared the black and white situation of rape, where you know that person only had disgusting and an evil intent.

I think we both agree on that drugs should be a medical issue, not a criminal issue, of course if the person is only a user. And yeah I also agree that race isn‚Äôt the entire reason, but the fact that it even had to do with such laws is fucked up, even if it‚Äôs only 10%, race should‚Äôve never been a factor in this, no matter how big or small. Even socio economic status shouldn‚Äôt be a factor deciding if a person will be spending time in a jail or if you get a good lawyer you can just get put on probation. We need better public defenders, better laws, and more care and empathy for our citizens for going through the trrrible disease of addiction

422^shalean^black^My man... that was a great read. I‚Äôm gonna sound like a weirdo but honestly great text and use of words but I whole heartedly agree with you. Prohibition was originally built off of racism with reefer madness, and too this day, our gov officials still think it‚Äôs a great idea despite the repeated failures, and not only in our country but Latin Ameirica, mainly Mexico. Still getting worse and worse and trafficking the highest amount of drugs then ever before.

The black guy that‚Äôs trying to feed us daughter by selling crack by the dime bag will go to prison for years for the smallest amount. But hey, the CIA and our president knowingly trafficking kilos of cocaine to the USA, using that money to buy/sell weapons to Iran, that‚Äôs perfectly okay, hey maybe if we commit treason with a drug charge we‚Äôll get off easier, oh wait no that‚Äôs not it, they got power money and their white.

Was my main plug for years and then suddenly only had fent, so I stopped going to her and she got some of her normal China again recently and today I bough this and some ghb and didn‚Äôt look at the dope until like hours later and instantly knew it was that fucking fent. 

Fuck I‚Äôm heated lol that could have fucking killed me or some shit

426^KingxxxBoom^black^Sorry for your loss. I had a friend overdose 2 days ago on fentanyl and I was able to save his life due to my quick action in calling 911. I‚Äôve smoked fentanyl for a bit with him prior and I can say the drug itself is very addicting much more than heroin imo. The high is short but very intense and can be something that‚Äôs very psychologically grasping on ones mind. Quitting it very hard and it‚Äôs a really easy drug to binge on. After a bit you start to get sick and hurt physically too. Depending on what you‚Äôre getting (street wise) you can never be actually sure how much fentanyl you are getting. In this case it‚Äôs really easy to get excited and do more than you are usually tolerated too. It catches up to you eventually and when you overdose it‚Äôs too late. You lose total consciousness and black out. Where your breathing then stops and eventually you die. Everyone has their reasons for doing it. And I‚Äôm sure your dad didn‚Äôt want to end his life. The drug is a monster in my eyes. Hopefully this gives a little insight to the drug and how it affects people.

426^KingxxxBoom^opiates^I was scared for my freedom at first as well but in my head my best friends life was more important than any trouble we‚Äôd face so I made that call and confidently helped the cops help me. I‚Äôve been using opiates on and off for 3 years from hydros to heroin and I‚Äôve used fentanyl before my friend had popped the half and smoked the one with me. I didn‚Äôt overdose but that was his mistake taking that half I believe. I‚Äôm glad you made it out after taking that bar. It‚Äôs pretty disturbing to see all this fentanyl going around everywhere. Hope it will all just end.

426^KingxxxBoom^opiates^Thank you. Definitely not doing anymore opiates this experience was more than enough of a push to keep me away from doing any more. My friend says the same.

426^KingxxxBoom^dreams^It‚Äôs almost a dizzying feel in your head and warmth everywhere. Your eyes get lazy and you nod off like crazy while having these weird waking dreams. I‚Äôve only smoked H though. Not worth trying though really addictive in my opinion

426^KingxxxBoom^opiates^When my friend overdosed (it was on fentanyl, similar to heroin but much much stronger) I blacked out for at least 20 minutes and somehow woke up while he was unconscious he couldn‚Äôt wake up I did everything in my power to try but he was lifeless. When the cops and ambulance came to revive him they used narcan nasal spray to stop the opiates. He woke up hurting, sick, and confused. During the overdose he was grunting for breaths. But it‚Äôs just nothing once you‚Äôve blacked out. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs peaceful but you‚Äôll never know what happened right after the dose. I don‚Äôt condone ever using it to kill ones self though. The off chance you wake up it‚Äôs not gonna be pretty you could wake up with brain damage having to be on life support for the rest of your life. It‚Äôs like gambling. You just don‚Äôt know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
427^stondddd^chocolate^Jesus turned water into wine and you turned shrooms into chocolate, not saying your Jesus or anything, but I personally don‚Äôt know you so I think you should look into it.

427^stondddd^opiate^As a former opiate addict, I‚Äôm thinking he knew he was most likely facing some time and wanted to atleast go to jail high as fuck. Tons of my friends have ate drugs when they got pulled over, back when I was bad on pills I can see myself taking 1-2 more pills then usual but an intentional overdose even if your hoping they‚Äôd take you to a hospital before jail or give you special treatment or whatever it is just isn‚Äôt worth it. This all seems like he made a bad choice and ended up overdosing. Overdosing on oxy or codeine alone is one thing but mixing them together could cause a seizure. As for how he got narcanned and didn‚Äôt come out of it Is beyond me but he must have taken way too high of a dose.

427^stondddd^opiate^I know, but I‚Äôll be honest, oxycodone and me have a love hate relationship. I‚Äôve been addicted and I‚Äôve gotten out of it more then I can remember, currently it‚Äôs hard to get actual oxycodone with all the fentanyl so I usually take kratom. 

That being said it was my birthday and I was only planning on dropping acid, went to meet up with the plug and he gifted me an unknown dose of the 4 aco dmt, I had tried it before and was confident enough that I could have 10 drops of it and that would equal about an eighth of shrooms, he gave me 6 drops and also had some oxycodone for cheaper then usual so I took him up on that.  I‚Äôve mixed oxycodone with lsd before and it‚Äôs not worth it, it kills the visuals pretty good and takes you out of the fun lsd headspace and instead your in more of a ‚Äútrippy opiate fog‚Äù in hindsight I wish I would have just done the acid and shrooms because it would have been so much more memorable and I‚Äôd actually have a good story worth telling. 

The biggest downside was at 4am I decided I‚Äôd lay down and try to get some sleep, I rack up a large line of oxy, enough I felt confident that it would make me nod out if it wasn‚Äôt for the lsd stimulation. I snort the line and as soon as it hit me I got the worst brain zaps in my fucking life, worst headache, migraine, whatever the fuck your want to call it but I swear to god i was counting the seconds and it lasted an hour on the dot. Never ever doing that again and my homie also reported brain zaps on oxy and shrooms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
428^bigpoppa979^opiates^Depends on what you‚Äôre taking and how long. The physical withdrawal are short and most likely the least of your concern if you have been taking stronger meds. The Psych symptoms are the worst part of it and that took me 4-5 months to get over and I‚Äôm still not 100%. You will likely need meds to help ease off due to long term use.
I use Cymbalta and Gabapentin but some use SSRI and or Benzo‚Äôs. The Anxiety is crippling when you quit because every emotion youve been suppressing with Opiates comes back magnified times 10. When i quit, the panic attacks were so bad I thought my brain was broken. It DOES give better but only with time, the right people around you and a will to stay sober.

428^bigpoppa979^opiate^9 days now? How are you feeling? I‚Äôm in same boat. I‚Äôm on Day 4 going off 13 year opiate addiction. Are you doing well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
429^vanderbolts^dreams^Same, I never have pleasant dreams. If I'm lucky there's just something weird going on. If I'm not (which is most of the time) something is chasing me or trying to kill or harm me in some way. The earliest dream I can remember was two guys breaking into my house and trying to kidnap me when I was about four years old.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
430^burf2500^opiates^I have to be totally honest and say that I got addicted to benzos from taking them recreationally, but the fact that there were so many floating out there from prescriptions or people getting them online made it way too easy. I've dealt with all the same issues you've mentioned, and I've actually been addicted to opiates as well and I can say without a doubt that benzos are much more debilitating and the withdrawal is much worse & longer. The word needs to get out there how vile these things are because they don't have the reputation that opiates do.

430^burf2500^opiates^I always love hearing from old timers (hope you don't mind that term). It must be hard having to go through this struggle later in life because I'm turning 40 in a month and a half, been doing opiates since I was 25, just now at the tail end of coming off Suboxone after 12 years, and it feels like a lifetime already. Most people I know cycle between using and being clean through jail or rehab, so to be hooked on opiates for 12 years has really made me almost forget what it's like to be free of them. Getting off opiates is hard in itself but I know the real battle is staying clean long term. That voice will always be in your head trying to convince you that you can use just the right amount, and for me that's really a tough struggle because for the first few years I did opiates I managed to do so only once or twice a week. It was all fun and games; no tolerance, not much money spent, and no withdrawals to run from. But I know those days are long gone because the addiction progressed, just like everybody said it would. 

Funny you mentioned how your generation tried to change things because I was just watching James Taylor on the Late Show talking about that too. I think the 60's did bring a lot of change, most of it for the good but I also think it normalized drugs a little more. Some things don't change though, and it seems like our country (and the world really) go in cycles. This opioid crisis is a complete nightmare right now. There are a lot of factors but I think the biggest is the pharma industry pushing painkillers in the 90's and early 2000's. I got started popping pills from injuries and surgery, and then scoring them from other people. Most people don't all of a sudden decide to try heroin one day, but popping a pill doesn't seem out of the ordinary because EVERYBODY takes some kind of pill. Now there's more awareness about painkillers, but back in the early 2000's when I started taking them there wasn't quite the stigma that there is now. I think there has been a lot of advancement with treatment. Suboxone is a good step forward, and the ACA gave a lot of addicts insurance which is required to cover addiction treatment. The insurance I used to have through my job didn't cover addiction treatment, which is ridiculous. I just hit 5 years clean and it trips me out how I want to stay clean as bad as I wanted to get high back in the day. Anyway, I hope you get to where you want to be.

430^burf2500^opiate^It's a potent drug and even .25mg is more than you think it is. The good thing is coming off such a small dose your withdrawals might not last that long, so after 48 hours things could start to get better soon. You could always start skipping days of taking it, and increase the days you don't take it each week. Kratom can help but don't go too crazy with it because even though it's not a true opiate it still acts on your opiate receptors and can hold back your healing. If don't already have clonidine get some off that, Imodium with the stomach cramps and withdrawals all around, and there are a ton of herbal remedies that can help you sleep and calm your anxiety.

430^burf2500^opiate^I completely agree. Heroin and methadone withdrawal are the only times I've really considered offing myself just to end the misery. Suboxone can be rough but nothing like a full agonist with a short half life. Another reason I think people say Suboxone is harder detox from is it's the only opiate that they've ever completely come off of. Not many people go through the full detox process from heroin or other opiates as they usually go on Suboxone instead of pushing through. A while back I was using hydrocodone to come off 6mg of Suboxone, and while it helped I still felt the Sub withdrawals. Once I got through a couple weeks I decided it was time to stop the hydro and even though that stuff isn't strong the withdrawal was insane. My legs were so restless they were almost flailing around involuntarily and I wanted to saw them off. So yeah, short acting opiates are brutal since your body doesn't have time to adjust to them coming out of your system.

430^burf2500^opiates^Do not do it. With benzos any little bit you take for relief you will feel later on, any little bit. I've been addicted to opiates and with them you have some leeway to screw up and if you take some extra it won't affect you a whole lot, but with benzos it's a whole different story. You have to be extremely regimented and stick to the program no matter what. A few times I've taken a half mg or so of Valium and even that little amount will cause problems later on. If you really need a break just wait for the withdrawals to mellow out and then stay at the dose you're taking for a few weeks.

430^burf2500^opiates^Your body will always heal. I'm down to 1mg of Suboxone when I was on 24mg at one point, and I can already feel my endorphins  comin back. Music sounds better, food tastes better, and I have a sense of well being I haven't had in a long time. It will take a while for you to get back to normal after 5 plus years of doing opiates, but it will happen. Life might seem a little bland being clean but that's a separate issue.

430^burf2500^black^Nice little variety pack. That stuff on the left is super dark black and looks good. Last time I did tar it had fent in it, and while it got me super high I just don't like that crap. It's super sketchy. What I don't get is most people don't like fent, so why do the cartels put it in the dope? It's probably cheaper and makes for a stronger high.

430^burf2500^opiate^You'll get there. A month may seem like a long time but when you're talking about a long acting opiate like Suboxone it's not surprising you still feel off. I'd say within the next couple weeks you'll start to feel better, and by the end of month two you'll be doing a lot better. Maybe even close to normal. That's a high dose to jump from which takes longer to heal from. Exercise if you can, eat well, and drink lots of water.

I'm on 1-1.5mg right now and considering just jumping from it because I never feel well even if I stay at the same dose for a while. I don't know how I can get any lower when I'm already feeling crappy, so part of me feels like I need to just bite the bullet.

430^burf2500^opiate^Your right, and I've had all kinds of crap happen. Never had allergies bad before benzos and now they're horrible. I get acid reflux bad. Super fatigued. I worry about things constantly and never really feel at ease. I forget stuff. I've dealt with opiate addiction for years and I can say without a doubt that benzos are not only harder to come off but they also affect your health a lot more. When I was just on opiates I loved a pretty normal life. I worked, exercised, had a social life, but all that changed after benzos. Hopefully the body is as resilient as everybody says and we can heal from all this stuff.

430^burf2500^opiates^I'm so fortunate to have the coolest doctor a person could ask for. He's a recovering addict (not from opiates but just about everything else) so he can sympathize what I'm going through. He'll write me a script for whatever version of Sub I want, has written me a replacement script when my other one got damaged by water, and even called the pharmacy to give me early refills. To be honest he used to be a candyman doctor and would load addicts up with all kinds of good stuff, I'm guessing because he figured if they could get high off their medication they wouldn't do dope. One guy I knew used to get 400mg of extended release morphine a day (before that it was 90mg of methadone), 3mg of Klonopin, and Adderall. But the medical board came down on him and now he can only prescribe Suboxone. I could go on and on about cool things he's done for me, but there bottom line is he saved my life when I was a desperate strung out heroin addict and now I've been clean for over 5 years. He says it's rewarding for him and I believe since he's in the NA scene and likes to give back. On the flip side he can be a loose cannon and is super moody. That's great you found a doctor that's willing to make things easier for you. My philosophy, and I'm pretty sure my doctor's too, is that if you make recovery and being on Suboxone as convenient as possible it will encourage you to stay clean and keep living a normal life. I also feel a debt to my doctor and that I owe it to him to stay clean after how cool he's been to me. Do your best to keep that doctor and always do the right thing. Btw, I don't get this great that addicts will abuse plain buprenorphine. It's been proven that people can inject Suboxone without getting withdrawals, and buprenorphine just isn't a drug that is really good for abusing. I've abused a lot of stuff but never buprenorphine and I've gotten every form of it at some point.

430^burf2500^opiate^I've never been to jail for more than a day before I even had an opiate habit, but some of the stories I hear blow my mind how callous the jail personnel are. There was a girl who died in my town from dehydration even though she was desperately trying to get help, and I've heard the same story happen all over the country. If you have a prescription I don't know why they won't just let you take it or at least do a taper. It's more dangerous for them because it puts your health at risk, and if they think it teaches you a lesson that's not true because most people just start taking an opiate again once they get out.

430^burf2500^opiate^Some people say they feel better on Subs, but I'm not sure if they mean instead of using other opiates or being in withdrawals. I find it hard to believe that anybody feels better on Suboxone than they did before they were on any opiate period. Everybody is different though. When I say I feel better on a lower dose it's a bit of a mixed bag. I do feel crappy and worn out from withdrawals, but I also have feelings of well being, music sounds awesome, I'm not as fatigued, I'm regular, stuff like that. It's going to suck to a certain degree coming off Suboxone, and you have to give it a while before your body heals.

430^burf2500^opiates^I've noticed the music thing too as I've gotten to lower doses of Sub, and when I've detoxed back in the day. Once your endorphins and dopamine start flowing again you can enjoy things a lot more. I've noticed food tastes a lot better too. Both of those chemicals basically make you feel good, and when you're hooked on opiates your body stops producing them. By the way, as far as Alice in Chains go I like all their stuff, but a couple songs that really stand out that don't get much play are Got Me Wrong and Nutshell.

430^burf2500^opiate^Just a note on Vivitrol. I took a medication called Revia that has naltrexone when I was in rehab, and it gave me super bad anxiety. The doctor said that it can block some of your body's natural opiate like chemicals, like endorphins, and give you anxiety. I stopped taking it and felt better. A lot of people do fine on Vivitrol and Revia though.

Must be hard to stay clean in Baltimore. That place is world renowned for having the most ample supply of heroin, and good quality too. Good job on your clean time! Things should keep getting better.

430^burf2500^opiates^Sounds like you're going through post acute withdrawal. It'll get better with time but it definitely lingers longer than the acute phase. It also sounds like you're just starting to learn how to live life clean, which takes time also but it will happen as long as you work for it. No matter how much your mind tries to tell you that life was better on opiates it's a lie and complete bullshit.

430^burf2500^opiates^Probably not that high, but I would always take benzos excessively if I had access to them. I actually abused them for about 10 years recreationally but never had any issues with physical addiction because I never had a consistent supply. Now I will never touch a benzo again for a few reasons. They're highly addictive and the withdrawals are complete hell, once you've been hooked on them it's easy to get physically addicted again, and most of all I can't control how much I take of them and will pop as many as I can get my hands on until I'm a blacked out slobbering mess. They have legit medical uses and if a person can take them responsibly then that's great, but I still think they're extremely dangerous. It's also easy to blur the lines of addiction because they're a prescription pill that do help with certain issues. Same thing with opiates; great for killing pain short term but highly addictive.

430^burf2500^opiate^An old school guy at an NA meeting told me one time "The monkey on your back never dies, it just sleeps and waits". Somehow I've managed to stay clean from all substances (including heroin) for 5 years and don't have the obsession to get high like I used to, but I'm also on a low dose of Suboxone and know if I got a prescription for painkillers it could be the start of a serious downhill dive. There were a couple of old timers in the NA scene that had 10 plus years clean that fell off, and hard. It's a shitty cross to bear always worrying about relapsing, but that's the way the cookie crumbles. Any addict can stay clean if they do the work and really want it though. And if you slip up just keep moving on and don't let it turn into a full on run where you have to worry about withdrawals. 

You did the whole Suboxone detox right. I have nothing against maintenance and was on Suboxone for 12 years myself, but if you really want to be clean off opiates then using Sub for a short term detox is the way to go. Sounds like it was a rough ride, but you hung with it and now you're free from the opiate ball & chain. Good job on your accomplishments.

431^dalpimps^opiates^I was into opiates, percs, morphine, anything I could get my hands on. I‚Äôve been using a MAT program, I know others don‚Äôt believe that as truly clean, but I like to. I‚Äôve started weening off the suboxone, so once I‚Äôm done with that I will be completely free :)

432^OmATIRix^black^People should be allowed to take drugs, because its not harming anyone besides the user, so its basicly a "crime without victim". Adults can make their own decision wheather they want to take drugs or not. It doesnt even matter if drugs are illegal. People make their choice either way. 
Criminalizing people for something that shouldnt be a crime in the first place only forces users to keep their use a secret, which leads to problematic consume patterns and makes people afraid to get help. 
The black market also fuels organized crime and in some parts of the world even terrorism.
Drugs on the black market are also way more dangerous, than they need to be. 
Who would od on fent, if drugs werent cut with it? Who would od on heroin, if it was the same potency everytime? 
Making drugs illegal only creates additional problems, without adressing the real problems, drugs can cause. 
People who struggle with addiction or are suffering from their drug use need help, not a lawsuit. 
People who want to roll on molly every now and then need to be educated about safer use and dosage and need to know how strong the pills are or if they even contain mdma.

Legalizing all drugs wont solve the problems that come with drugs. But it will solve the problems caused by prohibition.

TlDr
Legalize all drugs

432^OmATIRix^chocolate^Chocolate is easy to make. 
Just decarb youre bud and crush it as fine as possible.
Then boil some water in a big pot and put a smaller pot in the water. Melt chocolate in the smaller pot. Then mix youre bud with the chocolate and fill it in a mold. Then just let it cool and harden out in the fridge and enjoy.

It sound like im advocating but srs I smoke only 1 cig a day in them and it turned my phlegm into a dark black uncontrollable projectile. Quit for a week black went away and back they came :(

434^throwawayretardhaha^opiate^Thanks, I'm pretty much opiate naive (bar kratom) and kind of wish I'd gone the opi route instead of the benzo/gabas route. It's weird thinking that if I had to go somewhere without access to my meds I could legit drop dead (not likely abuse not that extreme but still).

434^throwawayretardhaha^opiate^Depends on your tolerance. 2G of red was a comfy blanket feeling but I am opiate naive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
435^sk8thow8^china^Bah, I was gonna go with that.

Short high and not too over the top? Other than the missing redose urge it fits. NEP or hex-en.

Or there's a new one coming from China because they did ban hexen/nep. I wanna say ndh?

435^sk8thow8^opioid^Kratom is what you make it. Sorry this is a bit of a ramble, but I liked where it went.

Yes, it is a drug; an opioid even. And addiction is in every way shitty. But after 5+ years of daily kratom I feel it does something to treat my issues better than anything else I've been able to find. I've been an addict for 15+ years and your notion of some people needing something resonates very deeply with me. Because I've always needed something ever since I started over half my life ago.

Whether or not I'm accurate when I say "I need something" is irrelevant. Because even though I can maybe muster up the willpower to get by for hours, days, months, or years at a time, there's still a part of me that continually tells me the same lie: **"you need something else."**

Usually, I can reply back **"No, I don't. This is uncomfortable but bearable."** and get by for the moment. But the voice always comes back and I'm not always so strong that I can disagree. Sometimes, everyone really does need something else. I wish I was like the rest of them that could always stand up against that force in their head that never stops saying "you need something else". But I haven't got there yet and I don't think I ever will.

Worse than the voice, is how I learned to cope with it. There are many drugs that help the incessant want for more, and some do so well of making you feel better that even if I sobered up to a brand new me that didn't have a want for more; just the idea of not being up where that "better" state was would start a new and echoing voice in my head also saying "get back where you were". Obviously you never sober up to a new and happier self. So when that voice of **"you need something else"** comes back, it's a bit louder and it has more to say. Now it's saying: **"you need something else, you need to get back where you were."**

This creates a feedback loop that destroys you most always. I may have been talking about drugs in this, but what I just narrated is the same way all desires sound and talk. Drugs just happen to be one of the loudest and most destructive desires. But this can happen with anything from food, sex, money, ect.  What's most important is not what desires you avoid - it's how you react to desires.

I wish with all of myself I didn't need kratom, but it's the only something so far that can keep a continuous balance in my life of hushing the always present "you need something else" in a way that does leave me in ruin. Unlike every other drug I've been addicted to it has a ceiling of abuse, but still manages to keep me from agonizing over not having something else.

Yes, maybe kratom isn't ideal and maybe a perfect human should get by without it, but I feel it currently makes me a more functional and happier human than without it. Kratom isn't free and without cost, but it's worth it for me. I'll keep an eye on it and adjust my use when this becomes untrue.

435^sk8thow8^toys^That means it's something worth buying.

The test isn't to get them to not buy toys. It's to get them to only buy badass toys. Because I don't want to play with shit toys. Kids will buy any shit toy you allow them buy and I'm an adult who buys this stuff. Let's buy the fucking awesome toys.

435^sk8thow8^opioid^Did you step down off a harder opioid?

I could probably handle a 9g dose now, but 9g would've ~~killed me~~ made me puke for hours back when I started.

Your use seems about the same as mine just a little higher I'm probably 6+g doses 3-4x a day. But I wasn't stepping off opioids when I started (so no tolerance) and my use was lower at first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
436^ISilentDreamz^opioid^Tell that to r/kratom lol. Even outside of that I always get downvoted to hell everytime I don't refer to it as just a plant or god forbid I acknowledge its opioid nature...

436^ISilentDreamz^chocolate^5-10 minutes for me. When I take maois I love to eat high cocoa powder chocolate as it gives an amphetamine like high for 10-30 minutes

436^ISilentDreamz^opioid^I once lurked in the r/opiates sub to see how was the codeine+kratom combo.As I wanted to try it and found a fuckton of posts that said don't do an opioid after kratom cause it will cancel the high and general consensus there is that it latches hard to the receptors but it aint such a strong of an agonist as the other ones,so it fucks up the high. So out of experience most of the people there suggested to first take opoioid of choice and then add kratom.Also imo kratom is a mighty fine, almost classical opoioid, by itself,if you haven't tried it in higher doses I suggest you should and don't worry too much about the wobbles you'll know they are coming before they hit you if you don't up your dose too dramatically. One last thing,opoids/kratom and benzos are the bomb. Goodbye and thanks for coming to my ted talk.

437^timcoons910^china^It's a government made distraction. What was the biggest thing in china before all of this nonsense? If you answered massive protests for freedom you'd be correct. Now all of the sudden it stopped? What a joke. Governments dont even hide corruption anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
438^HJMLong^black^Of course, theres towns named after hemp in the UK and US because that was their main crop (type 'hemp' into Google Maps) and there is definite evidence to show that they smoked it.  There has been clay pipes with cannabis resin found buried in Stratford-upon-Avon in England (where Shakespeare lived) and a more clear example in the US is that Abraham Lincoln once wrote in a letter to the head of Hohner Harmonica Company that his two favourite things are smoking 'a pipe of sweet hemp' and playing his harmonica

Basically, if you can get a buzz from it, people will do it, no matter what period in history.  Cannabis has only been illegal for around a hundred years because the US government didn't like the fact that it became linked with Mexican refugees from the civil war, and later with the black community.  It was made illegal in the UK because it was connected with West Indian immigrants, and in Europe it was linked with North African immigrants.  It's so taboo now but smoking hemp has been a thing pretty much forever, not the high-THC stuff that we have today, but a weaker, more basic kind was smoked. Cannabis is only now gaining popularity as we have found the vast medical benefits that it has

438^HJMLong^black^The dystopian nature of this game clearly shows that the 'average joe' doesn't make enough to live, they're all dead, there is very few healthy citizens but they're not exactly living in luxury.

I think the menu that you mention is from an era where the economy was booming and everyone had coins to spare.  Now the plague and the death has set in, the only sure and legal way to make a living we see is joining the watch, and I'm sure the regency would give their guards food and a bed, we see barracks and canteens for the guards in the game.  Their wages are very low because the economy has completely collapsed and the government can only afford very measly wages.   As they have no rent or food to worry about, and they get all their elixir through work, the guards may well spend all their money at a clean, plague-free bar at the end of a long week, a drink is still affordable with their wage, their job provides them with everything they need anyway.

Also, the guards clearly do sell their bullets, elixir and weapons on the black market, the bullets that Pierre sells to corvo are the same bullets that the guards use, and the gangs use the same guns and swords as the watch.

The economy is a bit weird in Dishonoured, but set in a society literally stripped of everyone except a handful of guardsmen and rich people, I think it is very justified

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
439^TiHKALmonster^black^I‚Äôm going through a similar conundrum right now, and I‚Äôve found that what I truly wanted to tone down was not drugs per se, but a way of life. Every day I wake up and feel an urge to change my headspace. Because of habit that‚Äôs generally weed or kratom. A few hours later I get that urge again. Nicotine or  coffee. Later that night? I fill the void with alcohol or weed. The thing is, when I‚Äôm taking breaks from these substances I don‚Äôt stop those urges, I just transfer them. Suddenly I jack off more to get my ‚Äúfix‚Äù. I‚Äôll find myself glued to reddit for 45 minutes at a time. I‚Äôll skip school work and watch 6 episodes of a TV show I‚Äôve already watched. By getting into drugs I‚Äôve sacrificed my ability to be content.

While I think it‚Äôs really interesting to argue back-and-forth about the nebulous definition of drugs, I think the dividing line in this case is substances or actions that promote hedonistic behavior. Discovering that was a relief for me, but also very difficult. Having to combat apathy and anhedonia from being sober is a lot harder if you can‚Äôt treat them with drugs lol. As many people say, it‚Äôs important to find hobbies to fill your time, because within this paradigm your goal is simply to fill the void of drugs with more acts of life.

In answer to your question I would personally define a drug as any substance which produces a marked change in headspace, whether that be black pepper and turmeric or a good bowl of Lucky Charms when you‚Äôre hungry. But the definition to note here is *getting high*, and defining that is reflexive almost by nature. Any sort of pleasure seeking and hedonistic behavior is reinforcing the drive to *get high* and so truly stepping away from a life of drugs naturally means finding more holistic ways of enjoying life.

439^TiHKALmonster^chocolate^That would have been ideal, but I ended up meeting a friend along the way who gave me hot chocolate so it turned out alright anyways :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
440^The_Recovery_Writer^opiate^Why not. It's society that helped breed the opiate epidemic and continues to rely on a system that keeps the majority impoverished, which fuels negative environmental situations. Recovery is about being open to new ideas. I'm simply poi ting out flaws and stating how we can address them if united. And irreguardless, even if you feel that way, it's just a poem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
441^xxAbigailll^black^Neither. You don‚Äôt HAVE to be married. But you also don‚Äôt HAVE to stay single forever. Those options seem super black and white. Where‚Äôs the gray area? I think you should continue to casually see people or date people. That way you‚Äôre never too lonely, but you also don‚Äôt have to commit severely. However, by doing this, you will possess the ability to maybe find someone special... someone who matches SO well with you that marriage might not seem so bad. But remember, this is YOUR life. Do whatever the hell makes you happy. Just don‚Äôt forget things don‚Äôt always have to be so black and white... there‚Äôs always a little gray area somewhere! Good luck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
442^Psychestim^opioid^The only thing Ive ever been addicted to was Nicotine and I cant imagine how hard it must be to go through opioid withdrawal, but downplaying other peoples addictions is definitely not the right thing to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
443^KickerS12X^opiates^I gotchu guys, that is hard as fuck to read.

>had to pull off on the side of the road to type this. i just had to tell every single one of this community that you guys are fucking awesome people. most of all of us are stuck in a different situation than most being addicted to opiates and opioids. its not fucking easy at all. its hard. we use drugs to feel good or not feel at all. we have all tried to get clean at one point or another because we want a better life and we had that enchantment to live like we did when we were kids,before this shit happened. we will get that life someday if you dont already have it. im rooting for all of you hard.

>i basically just wanted to tell you all that im very proud of you. we dont give up, we keep living, enjoying a little, and feel a little of pain. sometimes alot it feels like. BUT we keep going. you all are good people and deserve a great life full of happiness, joy,  great experiences.

443^KickerS12X^opioid^Oh man, I can't wait for Buzzfeed to see this post. *Corona Virus Linked To Opioid Epidemic. Click Here To See The 10 Ways Junkies Are Infecting America!*

443^KickerS12X^black^This was all correct info at one time, but this is not the case at all anymore and that article is very out of date on certain aspects. In this article it says that 56% of heroin comes from SEA (in 1990), but today we get less than 1% from SEA. It also says that Mexico produces 20%, whereas in 2016 it produced 86%. South American heroin only accounts for about 13% of total heroin imported into the US in 2016. 

You are definitely on the right track as to why there is an east/west divide as far as powder and heroin though. Most of the east coast was supplied by the Columbians with powder like you mentioned, and the west coast by the Mexicans. When the Columbians fell off the Mexicans picked up the slack and continued to provide a product that the people on the east coast were familiar with and wanted.

Here is some fun stuff to read about this topic:

[The 2016 Heroin Signature
Program Report](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-10/Heroin%20Signature%20Report%20FINAL.pdf)

[Heroin in brown, black and white: Structural factors and medical consequences in the US heroin market](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704563/)

443^KickerS12X^china^That is absolutely not what either of those things are. 

China white was traditionally white southeast Asian heroin of very high quality. Today china white refers to straight up fentanyl or fentanyl analogue dope.

Tar is primarily a mixture of diacetylmorphine (Heroin), 6-monoacetylmorphine, 3-MAM, and other morphine derivatives. This is due to incomplete acetylation because of the use of glacial acetic acid instead of acetic anhydride and the hydrolysis of the DAM.

East coast style #4 has a significantly higher diacetylmorphine content and lacks the lactose that is added to tar right after the acetylation process to make it 'tar up.'

Fentanyl feels nothing like tar, and tar feels significantly different than #4.

443^KickerS12X^opioid^Don't even feed into that bullshit he is talking. If it helped you and you are trying to potentially help others that is all that matters. No one here ever claimed it was a magic bullet or not an opioid, it was just presented as an option.

In my opinion the only thing that matters when it comes to drug use and addiction is quality of life. If you are happy and healthy with what you are putting into your body and you aren't hurting other people to do it then you are doing pretty damn well. 

Fuck that guy.

443^KickerS12X^opioid^No one is going to be able to answer this question for you because we don't know what type of test you are going to take. If you are only going to be given an 'instant' type test, like an EMIT or CEDIA cup test, and it is not sent to a lab for confirmation they will not be able to distinguish them, as they will both give a positive result on the 'opioid' panel.

If the test is sent to the lab for a GC/MS or LC/MS/MS test, or they send the 'instant' test to have it confirmed they will absolutely be able to tell the difference between the two drugs.

In summary, we cannot answer this question without more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
444^WestMichiganDabKing^opiate^I say just Suboxone. Kratom is good and all don't get me wrong, but imo it's for substituting the dope while subs are for getting off of opiods period.

I am an ex-heroin addict and a current Suboxone patient. I tried to use Kratom to get off the boy, but all it would do is kinda satisfy the physical craving but nothing for my mental addiction to the high. Suboxone on the other hand, this has worked for me.

I've never been to the methadone clinic and this is my first time being on Suboxone. From what I've been told and read, buprenorphine (active opiate in Suboxone) has a ceiling effect where you can only feel so high from it. Also, it sends your tolerance through the roof so that other opiates won't work.

Now take all of what I said with a grain of salt because this is just what I've heard from my doc and other Suboxone patients and someone who knows way more about subs will probably read this and think I'm an idiot.

What I've found though is this: the right dose of Suboxone will stop the physical craving, help immensely with the mental craving, and also serve as a safety blanket that blocks other opiates from working even if you tried to use them. It's a lifesaver

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
445^FentOverOxyAllDay^opiate^Please dont be fucking stupid

No free samples, they are scammers that already got banned from all the opiate subs. 

If you give them money your a fucking momo

445^FentOverOxyAllDay^opiates^I tried it once with a quartz dab rig cap which had the same shape as a meth pipe and I didn‚Äôt feel like I got as much smoke from it as I would off foil. I only tried it once but someone on opiates back when you could post pictures had posted a pic of a meth pipe with resin from heroin, he said it was his new favorite way, maybe I didn‚Äôt put enough H in it.

445^FentOverOxyAllDay^black^There is no black in my area so we are in 2 different types of ‚Äúsouth‚Äù. If your west of the Mississippi River, then you are no where near me. 

Anyways I‚Äôd rather have over priced powder then a cheap ball of tar. I smoke and shoot, and the times I‚Äôve visited Texas and bought balls of bth, it just doesn‚Äôt compare to the powder I get East of the Sip.

Found a local while in Texas and became friends, got a ball of black though him and he would shoot a .2 at one time, I‚Äôm use to at least .3 shot to start with and when I did it, it was so underwhelming. He was nodding off the .2 but it took me till a .7 till I started to feel it.

So yeah the experiences I‚Äôve had with tar has always been disappointing, his plug was Hispanic so I thought we were getting some good shit, even cold copped close to the border a few times straight from Hispanic dealers and the bth is just underwhelming to me, idk.

445^FentOverOxyAllDay^opiates^Hey man I appreciate the advice, truly, but I‚Äôve been doing this for years and I know that strips only test for about 40 of the 70 fentalogues, well aware but thank you for trying to look out, means a lot people look out for each other.

I‚Äôve been doing fent for about a year now(about 5 years in total doing opiates), but up to 12 fent 30s a day and I‚Äôve ordered a few different fentalogues off Empire. Only true way to tell if you have fent is GC/MS testing. 

I‚Äôve had a few RCs that feel just like heroin and last just as long if not longer, but after doing a gram a day of GC/MS tested heroin, I‚Äôm pretty confident in being able to tell if it‚Äôs dope or not. Its just one of the things that you pick up on after doing good heroin for awhile. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong tho, at the end of the day it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance that it could just be fent, I always start slow. 

Thanks again man!

445^FentOverOxyAllDay^opiates^I‚Äôve been doing opiates for years now and this is the first time I‚Äôve about spider webs, can you elaborate for me? 

My first thought is those make you trip like Dxm, second thought was that it webs in your nose

445^FentOverOxyAllDay^opiates^Side comment from what we‚Äôre talking about, when I first started dope, it took a random on the Opiates sub to open my mind up to the fact that my middle was fucking me over for months. After that I never had a problem like I had with that middle again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
446^OnCheckeredFloor^black^All i can tell you are my test results and experience.  2 hr black out,  never before experienced that,  and two drugs that i don't do in my system.

447^IHoppedOnPop^opiate^Ransom stole the Narcan (aka naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of an opiate overdose) from her kit, in order to ensure that she couldn't save him after she administered the morphine.

447^IHoppedOnPop^opiates^Man with a plan. Sounds like you got this covered.

>My plan for the apocalypse is probably to just hide and do drugs alone. Actually, that sounds a lot like my current life.

True, I'd probably do much of the same. I was using drugs to escape my reality long before Armageddon, so I could certainly justify doing it again at the end of the world.

And I guess I've already decided that Armageddon is the only circumstance under which I would ever return to opiates.

But this is probably why I wouldn't last very long. The world is ending, I guarantee my first thought is: whelp, time to get stoned.

447^IHoppedOnPop^black^Nobody is asking you to personally take responsibility for the war on drugs, though. Nobody is treating you like the aggressor. It doesn't hurt you at all. It doesn't point fingers.

Deciding how to allocate certain blocks of tax money is just a necessity, and if it's determined that poor black communities are the most in need and would be the most appropriate and beneficial *focus* of community development...I don't really see how that hurts you. When community development programs focus their efforts on the poorest, most displaced, most at-risk segments of society, it actually *does* end up benefiting everyone. Whenever you have a deeply disadvantaged community, it's necessary to address that community's issues head-on. Ignoring that systematic failure just makes it worse.

Think of it as triage -- you have to allocate your resources according to need. 

I'm sorry, I guess I just genuinely don't understand why this would be a bad thing. I agree that these funds should be used to benefit *all* segments of society in some form, but it just makes sense that you'd apply the greatest focus to the most problematic communities -- whatever they might be.

448^loadedjay^opiate^So is it safe to assume the Lidocaine 5% patches are NOT what we would consider ‚Äútop 10‚Äù opiate to find?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
449^Ijustwannagiveitatry^dreams^I just got outta rehab myself and the cravings haven‚Äôt dwindled at all. 3 nights in a row now I‚Äôve had VIVID dreams of shooting up and using. Basically what‚Äôs keeping me from using again is just reminding myself how goddamn LOW I felt after all those years of stealing and using. I‚Äôve stolen tens of thousands from my family, literally. Stolen checking books, credit card numbers and cash from their safe. Even with doing all that, they have forgiven me. But not again. If you have anything to lose, it‚Äôs not worth it. Addiction does NOT just affect you, it affects those around you as well, probably even more so. My mother was dying watching her son kill himself every single day. Never again. You can‚Äôt project too far into the future. You HAVE to take it day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute. Just don‚Äôt use today. Who knows about tomorrow, because it isn‚Äôt here yet. All you can control is today, and if you don‚Äôt use today, you have won. Feel free to message me or anything cause I struggle with this shit heavily. Adjusting to life sober seems impossible until you realize we are the minority and like 95% of people just live life like that anyways.

449^Ijustwannagiveitatry^opiates^That‚Äôs exactly what it took for me. My mental health, my physical health and my emotional health were all at an extreme all time low. Looking back on it from over a month ago, I am not sure how I lived. I remember my entire life just revolves around dope and opiates! Waking up getting my fix, worrying about running out and finding money to get some and if I didn‚Äôt how shitty I was about to feel so I would resort to stealing just to get my fix. Not to mention the UN FUCKING GODLY amount of time, for me and probably a lot of other people, I would wait around and waste hours of my day just to meet my dealer. I mean it was a whole goddamn ordeal that I would need to block like 4 hours of my day out for. And this was like at least 4 times a week I‚Äôd need to do that. I would never have enough to last me more then 2 days, and usually even if I had enough, I‚Äôd know I‚Äôd need more, so it was basically an everyday thing worrying about my next fix. I lived for the drug, and for me the physical withdrawal is what kept me coming back. I didn‚Äôt wanna feel shitty. Detox and rehab fixed that. Now that it‚Äôs been about 30 days I don‚Äôt have any physical symptoms. Maybe that‚Äôs because in rehab they give you EVERYTHING you need for a speedy recovery, I really do feel great. Now it‚Äôs just a mental battle. But I believe in you, I do.

450^blorgbots^opiates^You're right, but considering what he's actually saying, if anything the difference between weed and opiates makes his point MORE valid

450^blorgbots^black^"Black Pill" is the 'understanding' that genetics are 100% of romance and attraction, and thus some people just never had a chance with the opposite sex

Doomer is a general lack of hope in yourself and the world, often coupled with the knowledge both that you *could* improve yourself and that you won't put in the effort

It's hard to have both, because often doomers realize that they could be better

Why do I know all these distinctions between internet phrases? I don't know man

450^blorgbots^black^Also, there's a TON of circumstantial evidence that sweet drinks help, and I think there's even a study or two (not enough to truly *confirm*) that black pepper helps too

450^blorgbots^china^I already knew Rush was a piece of trash, but I'd only heard clips of some of his 'political beliefs' and the terrible shit he said about addicts while being one himself.

After he got this medal, I finally did research and realized JUST how fucking awful he is. A piece of trash is a guy that kicks an annoying kid. Rush is that fucking state-sized dump in china improbably floating on that trash 'island' in the Pacific

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
451^Ezcaro^opiates^It wont do you any good, you will just experience your current state of mind but 100x worse. I saw that stimulants dont work on you, so i would recomend downers like opiates and benzos. Be careful tho, they are still dangerous and you should do your research before trying it

452^DJ_forklift^black^Ight I've only tripped on benadryl twice once I saw some weird shi on a wall and some people walking around in the pitch black and I was at my freinds who had a broken window so it looked whack and the first time I did it I kept thinking people I knew were in the room and i be talking to then with my eyes closed and i would drag my head up force my eyes open and my freind looked at me and said xxxxxx isnt here but idk if I can do all that psych shit I definitely got mental health problems but who doesn't and I'm doing real good with freinds and family. Also yeh benadryl is I bitch.

452^DJ_forklift^black^Lol I've watch orange is the new black ok I'm totally good definitely. Yeah. Hey and I can read I bunch of shit in jueve. Nah frl though I dont think I'm going there soon the last time its was even close to this bad bad was like 5 months ago and I'm doing good thx though. And I think I'll be a gardener if I go to prison that seems nice.

453^smilesreallyalot^opiate^let me know im on 4mg currently! scared to do such a large jump as i still do feel some withdrawal from the full agonist opiate even on the 4mg im on. so i feel like dropping to more will make it even worse! day 22.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
454^chasingd0pamine^opioid^I guess the real benefits never come if you have chronic pain or something that calls for medication that isnt a real opioid. Every recovery is diff and mine would be significantly less beneficial or successful at all if i pulled my pain med and lost my life quality just to be clean and free. :/

454^chasingd0pamine^opioid^>C) it‚Äôs still a drug of addiction. We‚Äôre still opioid addicts, on buprenorphine. If you think you aren‚Äôt, go cold turkey.

It's a medication. I am dependent on my bupe, not engaging in addictive behaviors on it. Some people have issues like chronic pain nd need these drugs. It's no diff than many other drugs for legit health conditions

454^chasingd0pamine^black^Lol well i went into a Walmart in the hood with running partner at tbe time.  We were the only two non black ppl in the store. I intended to just look for another carseat for the dboy wbho needed one, but running partner (RP) said hey let's go look at TV. I was like o God. 

We found a 43"Vizio smart TV that had no spider wrap. Put in cart. Also charmin ultra soft TP and cosmic Brownies. There was no greeter by the door and RP said let's do a walkout , I was walking behind him pushing the cart while he stayed ahead looking around to see if we looked clear. I almost aborted the mission but said fuck it nd followed him out the door

The run to the car was a rush I couldn't believe I pulled it off. We tried to pawn the TV but the pawn shop wouldn't take it bc it had no cable box hookup. So we kept it for 2 weeks until one night high af on dope and dxm we randomly traded it to some random dboy who came to pick it up at 1am. Got $100worrh of dope for it. Wish I kept tv in retrospect.

454^chasingd0pamine^opiates^>I will always be passionate about drugs - namely opiates - but I have to switch into a mindset where I‚Äôm passionate about helping fellow addicts who are questioning if they‚Äôll ever truly be able to get clean (like me)

you can, imo, remain passionate about the other side of it still.  because harm reduction, helping people who are gonna use no matter what do it as safely as possible, is just as helpful and lifesaving as helping those questioning getting clean

454^chasingd0pamine^opiate^>our view seems a little short sighted. I'm actually a neuroscientist working on developing a non opioid pain medication. If we had one available would you take it and come off the bupe? 

yes. i would take the time to properly taper off, but yes absolutely i would. 

because i know in my heart that i am over my opioid abuse days. my next run will kill me and im not okay with that. i truly believe i would make the transition after tapering off, and that so long as i kept working my recovery i  would keep my counter of time off full agonists growing. 

>Your pain is worse when you don't have the opioid as a means to trick you into continuing to take it.

even if this is true, what do i do when i dont have it andi  literally cant stand to get out of bed without immediately grabbing a cane and knee brace? im fucking 26. what will my real adult life be? even if it was in my head, it is real. i have a real limp. i do really fall when my knee pops if i walk without a brace. i do have nerve pain that makes me cry sometimes. i do have to clutch the railing climbing stairs. i think these problems are in the injury in my leg, not my head... but either way, they are real and problematic...

>but I predict that addicts will lie and say the pain drug doesn't work for their pain just so they can keep on their opioid.... thats how powerful opioids are

i agree. many will. but i would give itan honest shot. being on bupe forever is not ideal. i dont want this for myself. i didnt choose this injury. bu ti have, have for a decade since i was 16, and always will and it will worsen as i age. im already a proud owner of  osteo arthritis, and RA is hereditary for me but my doc said my injury will likely set it off years prior to when it wouldve on its own. 

>If someone is on an opioid chronically you literally cannot trust anything they say regarding that compound from a scientific standpoint.

this just isnt true. ive run out of my suboxone for weeks at a time, a few times. i stuck it out. i didnt seek full agonists. i didnt even want them. i just had like no quality of life and couldnt function. despite trying to, like honestly trying. i was offered oxy to take the edge off and refused it. i dragged myself around the house, useless, but opiate free, instead. so i went back on the suboxone because it works for me. i need something that works for *me*, now. im open to other options though. im looking into ket infusions. its not like  i love being on bupe and chose this life for myself. but by choosing bupe i chose life, at the time - when i did need MAT. 

 >We cannot trust chronic opioid users in our study because they lie, we have to test the new pain drug on post surgery patients that haven't been on opioids before.

this is bullshit. they can lie too lmao. as  dr. house says, everyone lies. you cant trust anyone then really. only the results, not the words, if thts how you feel

454^chasingd0pamine^black^Ugh this. Recovery isn't black and white or one size fits all. Approaching it that way will ALWAYS fail ultimately. 

For me i  have severe chronic pain and choose subs as a compromise - i sacrifice pain control vs full agonist - bc my recovery needs equal attention as my pain condition.  I get a lot of shade for this and it's unfair.. some ppl need meds for X reason and csn still work recovery on them

454^chasingd0pamine^opiates^Firstly im not a guy  and I've never claimed I'm clean. I'm clean from full agonist opiates and my drug abuse but never claim to be "clean guy". I do take medications for legitimate conditions. I don't "brag" about the RC benzos I take, which I do take in place of a script i used to get. I've been prescribed benzos for my bpd and my anxiety disorder since 2013. But this actually isn't relevent  at all on a post about pain + recovery. I was listing my pain meds, not  every single medication i put in my body. Not that it's your business? Worry about your own recovery not my meds. last i recall I never hired you as my doctor  don't worry about it.

454^chasingd0pamine^opiates^>Opioids are like an allergy for me - I cannot use them responsibly or without negative consequences

ya thats how full agonists are for me. i can only handle bupe.

>It is possible to manage chronic pain without opiates. It‚Äôs hard and uncomfortable at times, but it‚Äôs worth it to be free from that which once enslaved me. I wish you all luck in your journey.

one day after i was off the bupe a while maybe, but what do i do in the meantime? not work, sleep, walk, stand, have any quality of life? 

its already hard and uncomfortable on a partial agonist at times. so i assume it would be that at ALL times on nothing. 

for me its not worth it to be free, im ok with a medication enslaving me if it allows me to have life quality. im 21mo free of my DOC heroin / and all full agonists, but i stay on the bupe and i think it will remain part of my journey.

454^chasingd0pamine^opioid^>I don't think anyone needs to be on buprenorphine. It's not a good pain drug. It's really not. I study pain, and partial agonists are not as effective at relieving pain.

its a good pain drug for me. and so what, you recommend i go back on a full agonist? i left full agonists to save my life. 


>Anyway, I don't believe that anyone needs buprenorphine. 

again, 1. ppl like me. it works for some. you might not think i need it but i do and youre not my doctor so your opinion isnt really releveant to that here 

>It's not like addicts have an opioid deficiency in their brain and need opioids to function. Buprenorphine just eliminates the seeking and the cost.

yes... maintenance. stepping stones. crutches for those who need them. for chronic relapsers. for those who would die without MAT....

"Lets give them another opioid that they can't overdose from, tell them it's medication, get them to stay on it forever and $$$$". "great idea Steve!"

it is medication. it is just often misused and misprescribed. and most ppl dont stay on for life, its not ideal in majority of situations. but i agree with the flaw in system. this is why i write custom tapers for ppl here - because their doctors are not helpful, and other resources have failed them.

454^chasingd0pamine^opiate^>Well, since this is an Opiate Recovery page, to me, clean means off any opiates.. partial antagonist or full, doesn‚Äôt matter. 

> doesn‚Äôt mean I wasn‚Äôt addicted to an opiate... It doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt have scraped, scrounged, and done whatever it took if my supply was cut off.

you were dependent on a medication. but if you wouldve done all that then yea your experience falls into addiction to it. 

>For me, when I‚Äôm physically addicted to something that‚Äôs going in my body to the point of ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt take this ____ I will go through withdrawals‚Äù sorry but that counts in my book. 

so people who take anti depressants count in your book? bc abruptly stopping SSRIs produce withdrawals, too. 

>Otherwise I‚Äôm just fooling myself into thinking I‚Äôve got it ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù - and that‚Äôs just ridiculous.

its possible to manage yourself and your life while taking a medication. i have been doing it for almost two years. 


as far as the rest, i get it. 

opiates make my life unmanagable too. but so does my chronic pain, which is why i compromise and take bupe.

454^chasingd0pamine^opiates^i got banned from venmo for once letting some girl give me some of thoise stolen card numbers to send her money and i got a percentage. i once had a manager at work ask me to keep my phne camera recording as i swipe cards and hold the card over the cam to catch the numbers while i grabbed their receipt off so that he could do the card fraud. i said fuck no, but that was back when i was on opiates functionally for myy pain as prescribed, not a junkie yet,

454^chasingd0pamine^black^Youre back on ogp for future reference. But thoughts always welcome here too. 

Speaking on Suboxone, i did NOT get any recreation when i induced this time around. In the past yes. This time no. I felt normal and have been working recovery and managing pain since. I've never heard of amphetamine assisted weaning. That's nuts? There is tbe risk you mention, but ppl who are serious bout recovery and who go on MAT and come off it the right way can find success and often do. It saves so many lives. 

>Cannabis and psychedelic based treatment might work for a handful of years at most if at all. The mixed results we do have and the sheer lack of medical studies just don't show much promise.


That's X more years a person is off dope. x more years a person lives. I think that is promising .

The problem with all of what you mentioned above is it's All med based. Meds alone wont cure you. Gotta work recovery too. Gotta work on personal growth. Your physical and mental health. Goals. Rebuilding. Recovering. Etc. 

Agree about rehab, usually doesn't stick.


>Federal decriminalization or legalization of illicit substances is just a hail mary resort, it's a 50/50 toss up.

50 percenr is better than 0. That many more lives potentially saved. That many more ppl out of the system for nonviolent drug crimes. 

>Legalization won't stop black market fentanyl

Itll help some people. Esp if mixed with regulation like get your drugs at the pharmacy like alcohol. And it'll help pain Patients who are only on the black market bc of this mess. 

>may have quit using but they never remedy the depression, anxiety, and/or psychosis that they are left with which results in not only relapse but suicide and permanent existential dissatisfaction.

That's bc you have to put in tbe work. Quitting alonedoesnt solve the problem.

454^chasingd0pamine^opiates^hmm ok. ill try it. could always try both.

i have nerve damage from my broken femur and that pain makes me cry sometimes, nerve pain is the worst pain there is and now i see why people say nothing compares to a toothache sometimes. 

im gonna have to find something monday. 

and yea thats why i asked about the epsom salt. bc epsom salt draws out infection. no absesss or anything rn tho. fingers crossed. i dont want any pain pills or anything, im on suboxone and wont take opiates even if they gave them to me i just want this out of my fucking mouth 

thanks for the advice man. appreciate it.

454^chasingd0pamine^opiate^right i gotcha. well i get it in a way. opiate use kinda really is a big deal. why not hang around methadone and suboxone clinics and find friends there lol

455^aparadiselost^dreams^I almost always trip at night, but one of my dreams is to go to the town I spent a lot of my childhood in, drop some acid in the morning, and spend the entire day roaming the fields and forests. I'd pack a backpack with a blanket, water, snacks, whatever else I think of. As a kid, I always adventured around like that with the other neighbourhood kids.

I've once tripped in this town though it was at night (well it's more like a village of less than 1000 people) and it brought so many old memories to life right in front of my eyes.

Just something I really want to do!

455^aparadiselost^black^I like a lot of the ideas here. I didn't know that serotonin was linked to spirituality, though, do you have a study on that or something? Not questioning it, just curious and would love to read more about it

I don't like rigidity, I don't want to cage things into strict labels or think in black and white. I think both identity and personality are very fluid, and all people are capable of drastic change. Life is so unpredictable that I've just stopped having expectations altogether. And in a way just having no expectations is optimistic as hell

I'm kinda annoyed when I've disagreed with a psychonaut and their response has literally been "take three tabs and you will finally understand" (well guess what, I did and still fucking disagree), because it's so arrogant to think that your reality is the right one. There is so much out of our own individual pools of perception, how can anyone claim to know the truth?? Even with the help of psychedelics, you're still at the mercy of your own limits. But still psychonauts are definitely onto something because yeah, some drugs can really help you grow.

For example I have issues with physical and emotional intimacy, for most of my life I didn't know how to express affection except through actions, but mdma actually taught me to tell people that I loved them and I finally hugged my sister for the first time in my life. I'm that emotionally awkward, I feel immense love sober but could never express it until then. I'm just really happy I got into it because it's made my life a bit easier.

But obviously it's only responsible use, that goes without saying 

Btw I love your writing style haha

456^MC2tha5thdegree^opiate^Dude you would most definitely know if you had a tolerance. I PROMISE YOU you DO NOT want to fuck with opiates let alone the fucking worst one ever which is fentanyl. It‚Äôs literally a 25+% you‚Äôd OD fucking with fent if you dont have a clue what an opiate tolerance is...man I‚Äôm not talking shit, I‚Äôm speaking truth and you don‚Äôt want to lose AT THE LEAST TEN YEARS OF YOUR LIFE!

456^MC2tha5thdegree^black^I‚Äôve had a few friends/associates who would take Xanax and have the worst anger come with the buzz. Literally like black out wanna fight and act crazy type shit. Then other people I know steal shit...they just help my anxiety

458^jollyroddy^opiate^I don't have the experience to help at the nitty gritty level you are facing and you should probably speak to a doc an get referred to speak to someone with experience preferable face to face. A charity or professional who deal with this routinely They can probably help you formulate a way to approach your wife in the best way possible with the least impact, I'd think it's pretty scary already for you . In the mindset you need to confront your demons and accept and try to understand all of them , why they influence you in such ways and get to the point where your fear of them is lessened. Write stuff down so you remember and carry a pencil and paper everywhere as stuff pops up so you can map it all out in a list. If there are issues or memories that you just can't bear to think about you need to be able to accept that you can't change that and it's always going to be there but with practise and maybe a bit of help you can draw a line under it and move on. Praying for you man. Get some help, Reddit opiate cocaine recovery or whatever. There is stuff online that can help but you need to save a bit of energy for this and spend time getting to know yourself man even the ugly bits and see where you can get to okay?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
459^trippy_potatoe^opium^Whole list of thinks I have tried is - nitrous, DXM, ether, chloroform, morphine(in form of opium), and of course nutmeg, caffeine and alcohol (Hope Iam not forgetting something).  I would like to try shrooms or lsd, but I didn't have the opportunity yet.

Nitrous is fun but short, best in combinations.

DXM is really interesting, but I don't have much experience with it

Ether is trash

Chloroform is kinda cool but still trash

My favorite is morphine, for obvious reasons.

459^trippy_potatoe^opium^Agree! I like natural substances too, I would like to try DMT. Iam planning on buying and trying Kanna, kratom, HBWR, ayuashca and others... I don't see the point of them being illegal (apart from opium). I would take synthetics only if I knew on 100% what Iam taking....  Explaining what's it like to trip is really hard, and at most I can outline what it's like... With the opium it's really important to be careful, even tho it's natural, it's very dangerous (lucky I don't have addictive personality, being high on it feels unimaginably good....). I will eventually post reports on all substances I have done/will do...

461^lt420lt^opiates^Yeah the level of pain of cluster headaches is so fucked my mind body dont know what to do except drown it out. 

Thanks for the kind words and wishing my headaches to be minimal and controlled. Ultimately benzos opiates are the key but it's just hard to stop at the therapeutic line because recreation is also so enticing. Thanks for taking the time to listen and reach out stranger

461^lt420lt^opiates^How are so many fuckkng idiots asking the same things about smoking or snorting benzos all the time on this sub. These aren't opiates folks. Just fucking eat the pills like the are meant to be

461^lt420lt^opiates^Hey man. Dont beat yourself up too hard. I'm an addict of benzos and opiates and I beat myself up but we all have a sickness that is almost impossible to control. Just take it as easy as you can and know people care for yah. Life can be shit sometimes but always be looking for that upswing again because life is never stagnant. Keep your head up player

461^lt420lt^opiate^Yo be the fuck careful with m box 30s man. How are you ingesting them? Eating or smoking? Most m box 30s you will find are fake as fuck, for some reason that's the pill aesthetic the cartels use and only use. 

They still manufacture real m box 30mg oxycontin pills but to find real ones now adays is nearly impossible due to the opiate crack down. And the price for those real oxy is skyrocketing people pay 35 and I've even seen 40 bucks for a real pill now. 

Always test your shit if you aren't sure specially with a substance as deadly as fentanyl. I bet 99 percent you have fake pills. If you are eating them, fentanyl has a shitty oral bioavailability so you may not feel a great amount. 

If you are interested, I would take a small piece and put it on foil to try smoking. If one small hit rocks you pretty good and tastes almost like popcorn, you got fake fent 30s. But in my opinion, they are way more bang for your buck because of how strong they are, like hundreds of times stronger than a regular 30mg oxy

461^lt420lt^opiates^Its funny cuz its like a bonding thing too since I'm the only other one in the store who does opiates and he used to shoot heroin and oxy before the methadone me and him are closer than he is with any other employee of the store üòÇüòÇ

461^lt420lt^opiates^Front desk work eh? I feel like work sitting down and not moving is so hard to do when on benzos and opiates without a tolerance because your body just nods automatically lol. Moving around keeps you from nodding so props if you can hold it down at the front desk üòÇ

461^lt420lt^black^Oxy was my first love my gateway down roads to black tar and fent but I wouldn't change it for the world. Oxy is heaven for a newbie or even experienced user

461^lt420lt^opiates^Yep weed klonopin and opiates are my vices for sure couldn't go without. Chronic pain is a bitch and it sucks having to navigate a maze that never seems to end with only my hand drawn map

463^bruuuuhidunnooo^black^Huh I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy with long hair and one of my favorite outfits when I go out is black skinny jeans, a white shirt, and my jean jacket. Fuck.

463^bruuuuhidunnooo^opiate^Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that I came down about 8 hours ago and haven‚Äôt slept in 30+ hours but this hit me in my feels (I hate using that phrase but it‚Äôs how it came out.) Probably because I know after starting my dance with opiates and the amount of use and impulsiveness I‚Äôve been progressing to that a day like this is on its way for me at some point. It has always been very clear to me that an opiate habit will eventually have to be stopped for life to progress at a certain point. Really hope you‚Äôre able to stick with it and put this chapter behind you. For an addict to quit it has to be a selfish choice where you‚Äôre getting sober for you. Not for other people who want you to but because you genuinely want to be done with it and move on. Hope you‚Äôre able to keep a positive mindset throughout recovery and that the bad days aren‚Äôt too bad and that they‚Äôre far and in between.

463^bruuuuhidunnooo^opiates^No no no. That‚Äôs not what I meant. That‚Äôs just a reason where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúehhh‚Äù about stopping. I started using drugs and drinking way before I was single or wanted a relationship. It‚Äôs just a nice plus that it fills that void for the time being.


Edit: after posting this I realized a better way to describe it is that having a connection with someone that I can open up to and let in would help motivate me to stop using. I wouldn‚Äôt want to give a significant other any information about the specific drug I‚Äôm using or hide an addiction from them. Even worse would be if they started using because of me. I could never forgive myself if I got someone started using opiates because of me.

463^bruuuuhidunnooo^opiate^I just started outpatient rehab and got a suboxone script for this very reason. My opiate habit didn‚Äôt really do anything to effect my work. I mean there was the time I was junk sick for a week over thanksgiving after I took Xanax on a bunch of opiates and lost a day and then I missed last Friday from being junk sick but everyone thought I was just normal sick. Besides that stuff it hasn‚Äôt disrupted my work or relationships and I was worried that getting clean would do more damage than using did but hopefully the suboxone will  help me continue to function while I get through this phase of quitting. I knew there was no way I could be responsible enough to wean myself off. Hope you‚Äôre able to figure something out to help get through this part too.

463^bruuuuhidunnooo^opiate^One of the other comments made me face the fact that I‚Äôve become physically dependent on opiates and the second half of this comment really helped motivate me to come clean to my parents about my use and start an outpatient rehab program. I go back tomorrow to get a suboxone script (assuming that‚Äôs what it will be but it could be another one I‚Äôm not sure yet) to get through the withdrawal phase of quitting. Thanks man. 6 months of regular opiate use is long enough.

463^bruuuuhidunnooo^opiates^How moderately? I generally take 225mg of Benadryl and 30mg of cetirizine spread out during a 12 hour high so I don‚Äôt have to deal with just how intense the fucking itch gets for me. Is it riskier to take it with another antihistamine plus morphine and etc. opiates in a dose similar to the size of the other antihistamines? I really only take this stuff for the itch so if it‚Äôs not better for itching than the others I‚Äôll probably never mix it. I‚Äôd google this shit but I mean google just says don‚Äôt take any antihistamines with opiates so what do they know

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
464^Slanglie^opiate^Looks like some type of diphenhydramine mixed with pipenol.. interesting

(Clearly sarcasm before all the opiate nazis march in ready to exterminate any non experts)

464^Slanglie^opiate^Which is about a year .,. Which is the same exact time when this chem and another opiate were brand new on the market and a vendor mixed the two up and MANY users got the other drug instead  . My guess is that's where all this panic and fear mongering stems from

464^Slanglie^opiates^Ok that chances things ALOT.. 20 days isn't long, however it's not a get out of jail card.
 So you won't be facing the full wrathe of a long term methadone withdrawal. But you will still face more than 72 hours.  You've been taking a substance with a 24-48 he half-life for two weeks. Your brain has had a non stop stream of metbadone in it for two weeks. It's going to withdraw.

I can't give you a time line because I truly don't know, but I would say at least a week and a half or  two weeks. And paws can still  be 6 months or even more.. insomnia could be 6  months. But those are my best guesses.

And benzos will definitely be a godsend but don't take it multiple times a day everyday. Then you'll be dependant on an even worse substance with deadly withdrawals. Save it for when 5he withdrawals are the worst. Taking them every 3 days should be enough to keep you from becoming dependant. It would be great to spend the whole 2 weeks blacked out, but it'll put you in a situation worse than methadone withdrawal. Fight the urge to dose daily. Forreal bro. Bemzo withdrawal is hell and much worse than opiates

464^Slanglie^opium^Morphine oral bioavailability it 10%. You eat 100 mgs of morphine only 10 are reaching your brain . You're literally throwing money away. Sure opium latex has many active alkaloids including codeine that IS orally active. But morphine Is the strongest and in highest concentrations
 .vaporiitze it if your able

464^Slanglie^opiate^At the clinics they preach sobriety in order to "phase up" and allow yourself to get extra take homes to come to the clinic less. Clinics DO NOT AND SHOULD NOT make you test dirty to get on methadone.. you could have spent the last 3 months in jail and been clean but knew Everytime you left jail you went and used so methadone might be a solution for cravings. They wouldn't turn away a non positive testing opiate user. I wss 3 months sober when I got on methadone. He's lying to you sadly, and for that I'm sorry for the pain and mistrust.

They don't want you to piss dirty, they give resources and meet with you and do what they can so that you DONT PISS DIRTY. And therefore they incentive clean UAs with extra take homes which means less chaos in your daily life of having to go to the clinic daily And the "liquid handcuffs" people speak of

464^Slanglie^opiates^Good to know thanks. That's what I'd guess. I'm only curious anyways. Im in recovery on maintenance. I take methadone and have Been off illicit opiates for a long time. It was merely curiousity

464^Slanglie^opiates^If I had some I would, but I don't buy or use opiates anymore. Was merely curious "pussy"

464^Slanglie^opioid^Ok so it sounds like its doable and also (not saying you) but people seem to think that how much a chemical burns is it's causticity. Causticity is how damaging to the body it is . If you plan to IM it and it was caustic, it would damage skin tissue all around the skin pop. So if so,  iv would be no different  

Otherwise it sounds effect effect effectwise,  and sounds able to be done with benecial effects .. but yes , no imperical data and lots of fear mongering. And the fact thst at the begining,  people weren't even receiving the right opioid. That other one they were getting  could be the caustic one for all we know

465^frostylagoo^black^im starting to come to the undestanding that youre right. shes just so sweet and i find her so beautiful. we have a lot in common and i love making her laugh. it sucks. it sucks that i had to do this. i remember when we first started talking there was this old black guy trying to fuck her and i literally said "this must be his first rehab because he should know its fucked up to try and hook up with a damaged vulnerable girl in a rehab". im a fucking hypocrit. i knew i was wrong but i couldnt help myself. it started as friends because we were the only ones there from the same area then i couldnt help but catch feelings. idk why but ive always had a problem with "crazy" girls. like this girl has a lot of baggage. like i do too but shes also expressed how shes not ready to stop using even though she ODed before coming to the treatment center. she also has really bad OCD where she cant touch anything or anyone, which made me feel special that she would hold my hand, and shes also balemic(spelling?). it was constantly getting us in trouble too. like i was doing step work and introspective work with my therapists so i wasnt completely just wasting my time, but all the while i was fucking around with this girl. they quickly put a ban on us where we werent allowed to talk to eachother. so we were constantly getting put on cerfew because we didnt follow that rule. she was a drug to me herself and im seeing that now. we pretty much did everything aside from having sex. like she didnt suck my dick or anything but i was fingering her and shit when we were able to be alone. i feel so bad about it now because i was not only hurting myself but i was getting her in trouble and hurting her chance at recovery. literally before i left we were talking saying goodbye and this guy, who was one of the people in charge and was constantly on our ass about the situation, came outside and saw us talking and he put her on curfew. its selfish as fuck because im getting her in trouble. before this last time i was getting in trouble too, but because i was on my way out he couldnt do anything to me so i literally got her alone into trouble. i just miss her. its making this whole situation just that much more difficult.

467^DabblingInIt^opiates^You have a support system here.  At least with me if nothing else.  Getting through the physical withdrawals is tough as hell, but those are short.  The mental side of things is a lot harder.  I lost my mother and father to cancer as well.  The opiates helped me live my life, but eventually it was way out of hand and all crumbled.  Have you considered kratom, L-theanine, vitamins, etc.?  Your body and mind are going to be on the negative side of that high and it's going to be hard to live that way, both on your mind and body.  At least for a while.  I'm 40 days into cold turkey, and may not have survived if I wasn't helped llterally off the ground and given a hand to start healing, but it's not a quick battle, it's a long war.  I'm here for you, you can do this, it's what your family and loved ones want for you.  Your father as well, and he would have faith that you can do it.

467^DabblingInIt^opiates^I watched most of it last night and finished it this morning.  It's a part of the story, but it's lacks any part from the side of the addict, and anything about the bigger problems.  Things like doctors getting people on opiates and other drugs with no plan or understanding on how to get them off.  No story addressing what happens to legitimate patients and addicts when all the red tape comes in to fight the 'opioid epidemic'.  Bless that man for following his heart and trying to help and save people.  He did what he saw as best for his community.  He just doesn't understand addiction without having been there, and who would expect that he could?

468^MetroMaker^china^They all do that BS whenever they mess up their re-up money. I had one "good" dBoy that was honest and told me upfront that he was at the end and had to sell underweight bags to make his re-up money. I stuck with him and it all worked out in the end. 

One thing that your dGirl said is right - there is some fent in all the China.

468^MetroMaker^opium^The opium is a dreamy sedated high. The oxy is a energized euphoria. They are very different.

468^MetroMaker^chocolate^You got me there. My chocolate milk came out of my nose when I laughed.

469^justfkm^dreams^I know, they make the dreams very vivid and yesterday took only 5mg. Today 0 maybe by the end of the day I'll be better gonna eat somethig and go for a walk in park. And forget about drugs, those 3 months were great. Now I feel like I messed up. üòì
Used benzos only this week, so I think it will go fast.

469^justfkm^dreams^I threw my stash. And I know....I fucked up. I need some advice. And that I think that the benzo is causing me the vivid dreams. I will avoid everything. But my dreams are crazy, yesterday I managed to beat one of my demons and stand up for myself and got rid of that nightmare. It happened three times tonight(three nightmares), but they were things like my grandma, which I did not visit.. She came for me and stuff. Do you think that after the chemicals go out of my body, will I stop to have these dreams? Last time I had them for 2 days, this time is been two days and I had fewer dreams and I could manage them.

I took valium for only one week around 70 mg, been 2 days clean since last valium, that last 250+250mg md dose was 5 days ago and I am clean of everything for 5 days. 

Also I am very sober, I can do any task with no problems..I am going soon to see a psychologist. I only wamt the vivid dreams to end. I do not have nightmares anymore.

469^justfkm^dreams^Thanks, I already drink elecrolyte water. The binge was 4 days ago ao today I am mostly fine. Except some dreams, I go to sleep and then I dream that I die(have a seizure). Kinda scary but its getting better. I am going to try bromate and l-theanine to see how it works. Hopefully in 2-3 days I am back to normal. I seem to recover pretty fast. I already threw all my stash.
Edit: and also, some waves and anxiety go throygh my body but they get weaker and weaker.
I do not think that was MDMA... My last binge left me incapacitated for two weeks.

470^throwitout696969691^black^5 mg is definitley waaaayyyy too much for somebodys first time they would black out. If youre going to take it start with .5 work youre way up if needed 1mg should put you to sleep nicely

471^chanandlerbong420^opiates^I quit a 1.5-3g a day heroin habit by switching to kratom. I've been taking it for closer to six months now and I've rarely been under 40g a day for quite a while now and have had a good amount of 55-70g days. I'm still an opiates addict and anyone in my situation that thinks any different is in denial

471^chanandlerbong420^black^Yeah wow his version is amazing. Do you think he's maybe using his thumb with the triplets to make it easier? I really doubt it but it seems crazy that his fingers would be able to move that using index-ring. Look up segovias version, there's a black and white video on YouTube. It's strange, it sounds more like hes playing 8th note 16th 16th note instead of the straight triplets

472^180onTheDVP^black^That was the same year I ran from the cops out of a construction site while tripping on LSA, got hit by a car while riding my bike in all black at 2 AM high on phenibut, smoked weed for the first time and get left in the woods by my shitty friends, and danced on the roof of the library in the rain while high.

472^180onTheDVP^opium^Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a South Asian plant that when ingested can have both stimulating and sedating effects. It's gained a lot of popularity because it's a legal and surprisingly safe alternative to opiates, and is especially helpful to addicts who are trying to stave off opiate withdrawal while they're quitting. 

(Note that Kratom is an *opioid* because it acts on opioid receptors, but is not derived from opium and therefore not an *opiate*)

Folks here might shit on you for not googling but honestly better you ask it here than the first page of a Google's search results. It's difficult to find accurate info on controversial drugs. **Some reliable, well respected sites that can better answer this question and others like this one in the future are** [**Erowid**](https://erowid.org)**,** [**PsychonautWiki**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)**, and** [**TripSit**](https://tripsit.me/)**.**

472^180onTheDVP^opiates^[TripSit has a decent chart for this.](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations)

In general alcohol isn't **great** to mix with much of anything - it's a CNS depressant so you can't mix other CNS depressants like opiates or benzodiazapines. It also raises blood pressure and increases heart rate so it's not particularly healthy to mix with stimulants.

You're not going to find a comprehensive list but for any given drug your curious about it should be as simple as a googling "is \[drug\] safe to mix with alcohol"

>I'm sure that will soon lead to drugs

It doesn't have to. I won't tell you to just "not do drugs" but the most dangerous thing you can do is willingly let yourself just "fall" into it. Though it can happen to anyone, one of the behaviors that can leave  you most vulnerable to addiction is to simply refuse to survey and self-reflect. Go into it with intention or not at all.

474^somethingsuperior^dreams^I hit 10 days today. Drove to the Snowflake Temple in AZ to show my son. Had some wild dreams last night but I‚Äôm not craving and actually turned down the pills my dead mom offered in a nightmare I had. That made me feel positive about my recovery. I‚Äôm 300 miles from home to detox at my cabin. I made it to a meeting yesterday evening but couldn‚Äôt find the right spot for the one tonight. Bummed me out a little, but I‚Äôm still feeling positive. I want to find an IOP in my city but, as a backup, I went through the NA meeting list today and made a list of meetings for every day of the week. It‚Äôs tough with a 4 year old and a small support system, but I am determined to STAY OFF my drug of choice this time around. I hope everyone is well üôÇ

474^somethingsuperior^opioid^Unfortunately, I‚Äôm a ways from Chicago. I‚Äôm in Phoenix, AZ. But I‚Äôm currently looking up providers that specialize in opioid recovery. I‚Äôd like to think this is enough, but I know I should probably hit some NA meetings the first couple months I get home. Minimum. I‚Äôm just so done. I spend thousands on pills a month, and while I can afford it, I could be doing so much more amazing things with that money. Mentally, I‚Äôm fed up that I let it go on this long. So I‚Äôm open to anything that will keep me on track. Thank you!

474^somethingsuperior^opiate^I‚Äôm down to my last one and saving it for a really rough night. I have my medical card so I‚Äôm trying to just use marijuana right now for sleep and symptoms. 

My other post was in the smaller opiate recovery group and I quickly realized the amount of support in that group was lacking. So here I am now! Thank you for the encouraging words. Just a few hours from 8 days. My energy is up today and I even have an appetite so I‚Äôm excited to get get something in my stomach üòú

474^somethingsuperior^opioid^Thank you for the advice. I didn‚Äôt realize there were opioid specialized psychiatrists. I‚Äôll start looking into that ASAP. I know PAWS can be the worst of it. I will say, however, that since I started kicking nearly 5 days ago, I haven‚Äôt once wanted to go get a pill to make the pain stop. I‚Äôm at a place where I‚Äôm pissed and done with them. That said, a psychiatrist can‚Äôt hurt because I don‚Äôt know what my future holds. Thanks for the tip!

475^PlanetOfTheGrapeApe^opiate^I mean my brother wants to give me equity in his business so that‚Äôs a plus and I hope you get better bro I never needed H or wanted to go to that extent cause I could literally get any opiate I want out of a pharmacy

476^SalaDboiz^opiates^I‚Äôm so loaded at work right now and love talking to people like myself in this sub. Non of my friends do opiates, so y‚Äôall are the only ones I get to talk to about this stuff

476^SalaDboiz^opiates^You should be fine. In my experience, both sub doctors I‚Äôve been to really didn‚Äôt care what was in my system on first appointment. I actually tested clean for all opiates my first time, just had weed in my system.

Just tell the truth. I said I‚Äôve been addicted for years on and off. I haven‚Äôt used in about a week but can‚Äôt stop thinking about pills every second of every day.

476^SalaDboiz^opium^Omg lol!! There isn‚Äôt a better class to partake in some oxy. Bring on the philosophical thoughts. I wonder if Socrates was hitting some opium to induce deep thought haha

476^SalaDboiz^opiates^You 100% right. I was feeling a little too good at the time of this post. It would just be awesome to have some friends to chill with who enjoy some opiates. All my friends smoke or only drink.

476^SalaDboiz^opiates^I actually said I need some ‚Äúboy‚Äù to start and they didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. Many people call it H, and dope can mean a bunch of different things. It was def scary to cold cop but I played it pretty safe and it worked out great in the end. I definitely don‚Äôt want methadone lol. I occasionally do this shit, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love it, but I‚Äôm not looking to do anything everyday like methadone. Totally worth it as I now found a plug with H instead of paying $15 for percs or $45 per 30mg blue. 

Not sure how I acted a fool as I didn‚Äôt put myself in harms way, and I‚Äôm definitely not new to this life as my first time doing H was about 10 years ago. I just dont do it much because I‚Äôm satisfied with burning heavy trees, but occasionally I want some opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
477^Doralze^black^I know this isn't going to add much but I vaguely remember someone at school mentioning a game that sounds similar to this. It would have been 2002 or 2003 since I was in the 6th grade and I was in an after-school programme in the library/computer lab. I noticed an older student (probably 8th grade) playing a game on one of the computers and I thought it was another game.  


My friends and I were starting to get into MMORPGs and we mostly played Runescape but there was a game a few people meddled with called "Astonia" because it could be played on the school computers without the firewall picking it up. I never got into it but enough of my friends played it that I could recognize it. That's what I thought the game was the older kid was playing. Simply because the graphics looked familiar.  


I asked him "Hey are you playing Astonia"? He replied "No." "What are you playing then.? I asked him. "A game where you kill your wife. Get out of here kid"!  


I never thought twice about it until I heard about this whole search going on. That's all I remember though. That the graphics looked like Astonia and from what I saw on the screen it was some kind of brown field and he was using the arrow keys to move around not the mouse.  


Maybe it will help but it's probably nothing. He did seem like an edgy kid though dyed black hair and a Nirvana hoodie so he's probably the type to visit obscure websites.

480^German-Horticulture^opiate^I am so sorry, love. This is going to be hard, but let‚Äôs try an exercise and see how it feels looking at this issue as a disease instead of something that he‚Äôs putting on himself. Reread through your post but replace it with a common disease maybe that you suffer from (ie acid reflux, or maybe asthma). Seems pretty silly right? Now let‚Äôs consider something more close to an opiate addiction, and replace addiction with another life threatening issue like cancer. How does that feel? Probably pretty shitty that you‚Äôre posting on a forum asking if you should leave your boyfriend over a disease he‚Äôs suffering from. Please realize the gravity of the situation. You are going to make it, but realize being there for someone with a disease is hard. He‚Äôs going to have to fight, but you‚Äôre going to have to fight so hard, too. It‚Äôs not fair, and it‚Äôs not easy. You are not a shitty person for leaving over a disease he‚Äôs hidden from you. You are justified to make any decision that is best for you. With that said, please never think of it as something he has chosen or done to himself. Please always remember our disease name replacement exercise and understand he needs to be in counseling and to work on being open with you if you‚Äôre going to help him. What I fear most is that he doesn‚Äôt want help, and this rejection will cost the relationship. With that said, most like myself, aren‚Äôt like this and have had tremendous relationships with people who are addicted, or as addicts ourselves. It‚Äôs entirely possible and couples get through it everyday, just like they do fighting other diseases together. Lots of love to you girl, please always feel free message me if you‚Äôre ever hurting or want another opinion.

480^German-Horticulture^opiates^Hahaha nah I wasn‚Äôt interacting with anyone directly for hours after since I have my own office so I just went back there to finish projects, send emails and make calls. I never try to get too out of mind to the point where I can‚Äôt work, and opiates have been a nice way to give me some more focus and euphoria when doing things like data work or boring GIS projects. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre not sustainable lol

480^German-Horticulture^opiate^Hahahaha yeah dude, I was thinking, ‚Äúsweet this Narcan will send me into an uncomfortable state and I can maybe mitigate the anxiety attack I‚Äôm having rn that‚Äôs making me think that I took too much.‚Äù When really I wasn‚Äôt nodding or anything, I was just anxious. I genuinely thought it would just stop my opiate trip and make me uncomfortable/sweat a little. I did not imagine I‚Äôd be puking as much as I did, and in a world of complete hurt. The only reason I called 911 was because I thought, ‚Äúoh man, what did I do, what if I‚Äôm allergic to this, why am I not able to see straight, why can‚Äôt I walk, and why can I not puke anymore and only feel pain‚Äù.

480^German-Horticulture^opiate^I‚Äôve heard about it for alcoholism but never looked into Naltrexone for opiates. From a google I see it‚Äôs an opiate antagonist - how strange. Thanks for sharing man, hope you‚Äôre doing well now.

480^German-Horticulture^opiate^Hey man, no the doctor will not know. All the test does is test for a certain metabolite of Hydrocodone. The dose does not change this benchmarker. They will not be testing for amount in your system, and surely wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell if you even took 100 of those pills. FYI, most tests use a common benchmarker for opiates so they won‚Äôt be able to tell if you‚Äôre on hydro, dilaudid etc - all they‚Äôll know is that you tested positive for some given opiate. You‚Äôre totally safe man, dm me if you got any questions like this and stay safe, bud

481^XannyTranny^opiates^Yeah im so happy that i dont have that here. I just need my good old H thats all that i want. I feel sorry for you guys in the midwest that must be a bad feeling to know that there could be a deadly amount of fent in your opiates even if you have tolerance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
482^skint_back^opiate^Those kids look like they are high on fentanyl in the picture. Look at how big they are smiling while they go to town on the opiate itch.

482^skint_back^opioid^Another inaccuracy that I see repeated hundreds of times here- bupe does not ‚Äúrip‚Äù oxy or heroin or anything else off your opioid receptors. An oxy molecule binds to you receptor for less than 1 second, then releases and recirculates to either be metabolized or bind again. A bupe molecule binds to your receptor for an average of 40 minutes. After which it also releases to recirculate and either reattach or get metabolized. So it‚Äôs not that bupe is ‚Äúripping‚Äù oxy off your receptors, it‚Äôs that bupe is occupying your receptors so that oxy can not attach (due to both the length of time that bupe stays attached and it‚Äôs higher binding affinity than oxy or any other full agonist opioids).

482^skint_back^opioid^In most any other context I would agree with you, but dope dealers (and opioid dealers in particular), tend to be slimy pieces of shit with zero respect for anyone else‚Äôs time.

My guy does not a real job, he does have kids but does not have custody, and he still makes customers wait hours and jump through hoops to meet him and get product. I truly believe many dealers are sadistic bastards who enjoy and fully exercise the power that the addictiveness of their product gives them.

I wish to high heaven that I lived in an area where gangs controlled the drug game. It‚Äôs a business to those guys- phone is turned on 9am-9pm everyday, somebody answers every time, and you have your product within 30 minutes (often less) of making the call, every time.

482^skint_back^black^When you‚Äôre the only white dude in a 100% black neighborhood washing a 20 year old Lexus on rims, it‚Äôs obvious what you are doing and why you are there.

Course IDK. Maybe it‚Äôs all just in my head. I met good people and have good times in the hood too

482^skint_back^opium^We recently met this parrot, Polly, on the streets of Mumbai while working on a new documentary featuring opioid addiction amongst India‚Äôs bird population. He has a prosthetic leg because he fell asleep in an awkward position while high on opium and had to have his leg amputated due to compartment syndrome.

The painkillers given to him in the hospital for his amputation surgery only served to fuel his addiction. If anything, being an amputee has made his main income source from panhandling more profitable because of peoples‚Äô sympathy for his disabled condition. This parrot must earn at least $200 per day just to stay well and avoid withdrawals.

We asked the parrot why he didn‚Äôt just quit. ‚ÄúPolly is a smacker,‚Äù is all he replied. We then offered to buy him lunch, but he said that lunch hour is the most profitable time of day for panhandling. Polly bummed a cigarette from a crew member, and then shuffled off to stand at a busy intersection with his cardboard sign.

If you or any parrot you know is suffering from opioid addiction, please call the national parrot substance abuse hotline toll-free at 1-800-357-9538.

482^skint_back^opiate^i work at a very prestigious private high school. I had a student walk in on me once as I was face down on my desk snooting a roxie. Also once had my boss walk in on me 5 seconds after I snooted a roxie and still had several more crushed up in plain sight on my desk.

Never heard a word about it. Other than an occasional bout of opiate rage, I‚Äôd say my addiction has had an extremely positive influence on my job performance. Everyone knows how opioids enable you to energetically work long hours.

482^skint_back^opioid^Minor injury getting 120 blues a month? No fucking way. The DEA requires specific IDC‚Äôs to justify opioid prescriptions for patients. A doctor who prescribes 3600mg a month of oxy for ICD‚Äôs for ‚Äúminor injuries‚Äù is going to be investigated by the DEA sooner rather than later.

482^skint_back^opioid^The answer you‚Äôre looking for: oxy

The answer you‚Äôre not looking for: this is the worst possible idea you could come up. The opioid high is only a temporary escape. You chase that feeling repeatedly, and soon you are psychologically and physically dependent. Then you spend all your money on the drug, and after that you probably resort to doing illegal things to get money. You finally realize you have a problem and try to detox at home, but you can‚Äôt because the withdrawals are horrible, so you go to rehab. Once you sober up in rehab, you realize the problems that you first tried to escape are still there, only now they are 100x worse. So you relapse to escape again, and the cycle starts all over. You waste years of your life cycling through rehabs and long periods of using drugs punctuated by shitty stints of sobriety. Maybe one day you get clean for good, maybe not. This is called ‚Äúaddiction,‚Äù and it‚Äôs almost a guarantee outcome if you go down this path. Please reconsider.

482^skint_back^opioid^Yep I am a mid-30‚Äôs guy who looks perfectly healthy from the outside, but I get sixty 10mg hydros a month due to some chronic pain issues. I have been looked down upon by pharmacists and pharmacy techs many times. Once I even had a fucking pharmacy tech openly question my need for the medication. Are you fucking kidding me? A pharmacy TECH is making medical decisions? 

The stigma surrounding even legitimate opioid users in the USA is sickening.

482^skint_back^opiate^That‚Äôs what happens when the male human orgasms for the first time after a 6 month opiate binge

482^skint_back^opioid^There is no source, he‚Äôs full of shit. The neurological changes induced by chronic opioid use are 100% reversible with sufficient abstinence, and that includes methadone.

The danger with opioids lies in overdose potential, and addiction potential and the risky behavior associated with it (sharing needles, risky sex, etc). Opioids are incredibly safe class of drugs otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
483^2_feet_back^opiates^I hadn‚Äôt really noticed, but yea, and as much as I don‚Äôt think it matters... people die from opiates OFTEN. They are both unhealthy choices. And can lead to serious danger. But meth is not as easy to OD‚Äôd on. But meth really lives in the shadows. I use in the shadows. It is kind of ridiculous. I think if people were fully educated on what it is, what it does they wouldn‚Äôt be so arrogant. Desoxyn is prescription meth. Stuff on the streets just very strong and often cut and cooked poorly. Meth is bad. But people think we are out here Drinking bleach and calling it drugs. People don‚Äôt know much in the life of meth users. What loved celebrity is going to win them over loool. Honestly the more I think of it, fuck those people. They aren‚Äôt just not on the addicts side. They are against them. And that‚Äôs just extra...

484^markvanslam^opiates^'Opiates are like magic! You just swallow a pill and half an hour later you're in pure bliss and all is right with the world.'....thought my 17 year old self.

484^markvanslam^opiate^I don't know. I was taking pretty large doses of tramadol. I was eating about 12 or 14 of the 50mg pills. The withdrawal from tramadol is actually much worse than people think. Because it has the serotonergic element to it it can be just as bad as other opiate withdrawals. I know because I've been through both.

484^markvanslam^black^I was lucky enough to go to nine Mile where he grew up and also to Tuff gong studios and 56 Hope road where he lived in Kingston. I got to meet his mother, Rita Marley, and Damien. Suffice it to say it was a good trip! 

What are you wondering about regarding the family tree? Basically you have Bob's parents who were a white man and a Jamaican woman. And then he and Rita had Ziggy and a few others.  Him and Cindy Breakspeare had Damien. She is half black and so is Bob so damion's 50/50 as well. He was with Cindy breakspeare around the time that he was spending in London. There's no way around it, kind of was not being a great guy when he cheated on Rita... But we all have our flaws I guess. I am happy to field any other questions as I have studied a lot about reggae.

484^markvanslam^opiate^Sure do whatever best for you. I've heard some people say that being on subs kills motivation but honestly I feel pretty fuckin motivated these days. It might keep me a bit mellow and I'm good with that. As long as you don't snort it, shoot it, or sell it, you could actually be preventing yourself from further opiate addiction if they still have a lot of allure to you. Best of luck to you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
485^MystickBlade^opiates^Yeah that‚Äôs what I mean leave out the Molly it won‚Äôt mix well, also the Xans will potentiate the opiates so it will be a bit stronger then just the Xans or just the hydros on their own so be careful with the dose. What I‚Äôm saying is either do just the Molly or do just the other three not the best idea to do all 4

487^thatonecouch^opiate^I have stage 4 endometriosis, degenerative joint disease, chronic kidney stones, and severe hemiplegic migraines. I was addicted to opiates, two in particular. I have 18 months clean now, and in that time I‚Äôve used prescribed medication twice, both times for major invasive surgeries. I get monthly epidural injections into my back to help with pain. I‚Äôve gone through broken ribs, kidney stones, migraines, root canals - all without using. Opioids are like an allergy for me - I cannot use them responsibly or without negative consequences. The two times I did take them I was heavily monitored, and my mom kept them out of my sight. I was only given three days worth each time.

Opioids were never designed to be used for chronic pain. They are targeted at acute pain, to manage it until definitive treatment is reached. Use for chronic pain is detrimental to one‚Äôs health. As the opiate hits the brain it releases dopamine, or the feel good juice. Over time the brain develops a tolerance and it takes more drug to prompt that response. It gets to the point that your body recognizes that the drugs are what make you feel good, so your brain sends signals (cravings) in an effort to get you to give it what it needs to function normally. If you don‚Äôt respond to that craving your body physically responds, increasing in intensity until you put in. Think of it like hunger. When you haven‚Äôt eaten, your body sends signals in the form of a craving for food, then it increases to stomach grumbling and cramping, so on and so forth until you eat or die. Your brain is functioning in a sort of survival mode when telling you to eat, and it‚Äôs in that same mode when telling you to put in more opiates. Of course you won‚Äôt die if you don‚Äôt put in, but you‚Äôll be depressed due to lack of dopamine. 

It is possible to manage chronic pain without opiates. It‚Äôs hard and uncomfortable at times, but it‚Äôs worth it to be free from that which once enslaved me. I wish you all luck in your journey.

487^thatonecouch^opiate^I‚Äôm proud of you for doing what you need to do. Methadone withdrawal can be tougher than normal opiate withdrawal, so prepare yourself. I think moving back to where you have a good support system is a great idea. I moved back in with my parents and, honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today without them. I want you to know that you CAN do this. I‚Äôm here for you, whenever. üñ§

opiates- like a week of diarrhea and feeling super lazy

benzos- the worst withdrawal known to me, can last months if you quit cold Turkey... fills you with every fear and anxiety you never had before. I went hungry cause I couldn't talk to someone to buy food. That was at like 3 months after cold turkey.

491^Dr3w_Cann0n^opioid^Thanks I'm going to kick the kratom as soon as I've hit the month mark because from what I've read that's when withdrawals subside and I'm left with paws.

My SO said I was just replacing addictions with the kratom jumped off and was left with a bad phenibut habit which I totally replaced with phase 2 of my opioid addiction which included the hard shit but I had a well paying job at that time until I went down the spiral losing that job, legal trouble and my kids and their mom. Point being gabagerics scare me, my first love were bars and alcohol , when I switched to phenibut the withdrawals were probably the worst I've had until I kicked this done.  But I do get where you're coming from I'm trying to get on suboxone and just taper down once I'm through the thick of this, while setting up a sober foundation and such.

491^Dr3w_Cann0n^opiates^It's a red state through and through. Also, I don't feel like opiates are on the level they're at on the east coast so help is scarce unless you're insured. The USA in general hates the poor.

491^Dr3w_Cann0n^opiates^I'd say you either die a stoner, get clean or progress to opiates. That is the natural order.

492^ikemichigan^dreams^Idk much about astrology but I also have pluto in the first house in sag with scorpio rising. Its seems to have a good and bad affect on me in many ways. I crave things that are real and will change me at my core. I feel like I could be a person with lots of power and could do a lot in life but the way the world is set up, and how boring it can get chasing your dreams and having to deal with the fakeness that goes along with corporations and making a career for yourself is a huge obstacle for me. I hate anything fake and having to put on a mask for people really bothers me. I want something that is gonna be real and life changing and as you are about to enter the corporate world this probably hurts you on a deep level. I know it would me at least. I want to make as much change and experience as much as I can why I'm here. Idk do you relate with that at all or does it even make sense? I could be off since your chart is a lot different then mine. But I'm assuming your well aware of your potential and power and you dont want to waste that going down a path where you aren't gonna a be in full control of the change you make in the world.

493^tigereye13^opiates^When I got tired of smoking weed everyday, I started doing opiates every day. It was great! For the first month. And then it ruined my entire life. So don't do that! üòÜ

493^tigereye13^opiate^Congrats!!! But a strong painkiller?? Lol. I thought tramadol was a weak opiate. It never did anything to me.. I def get higher on low dose hydro and even kratom than tramadol. But everyone is different. Good job!!

493^tigereye13^opiates^Just the usual replacing my dad's and grandma loratbs with Tylenol. Stealing tar from roommate (who introduced me opiates.. He wasn't even mad lol) pawning a guitar my mom got for Xmas. Making up stories why I needed money. Couple times took 40$ out the cash register at work. Never got caught tho. Thank god ive been over that addiction for a couple years.

493^tigereye13^opiate^Subs were the first opiate I got hooked on.. So personally i don't count it as clean time for myself. But everybody has a different definition. Clean time is when I'm not dependent on an opiate

493^tigereye13^opiate^Yeah that was my story. And I said bupe was the first opiate I got dependent on. But I had experience with oxy 30s and hydro 10s beforehand I was well on my way to addiction but found out about bupe from a roommate that was prescribed and overall enjoyed it more because I had a low tolerance, the half life was way longer, and it was cheaper. But I agree with it being hard to abuse bupe and get high. Yet it happens all the time. For instance, my aunt was suggested to go on suboxone from her doctor when she was coming off 40mg hydrocodone. And it ruined her life even more. Bupe is a lot stronger than hydro and after 8 months on bupe she decided to taper and quit. And the bupe wds made her want to die she said :(

493^tigereye13^opiates^Eyy hell ya! Congrats on the week clean from roxis! Roxi 30 was one of the first opiates I tried and quickly moved to bupe.  I just have one question about your reply. You start out saying, "I agree for your case since you were hooked to bupe. For most people though that‚Äôs not the case" could you clarify that? Because I believe majority of people on bupe are hooked to it, and have a dependence, in which they will have to go through withdrawals of they decide to quit. I was no different.. Yet, my dose was low to moderate. Before I got it prescribed from doctor, I would just take 2 mg every other day. But i agree with what you say. Bupe has been a miracle for a plethora of people. Personally, I don't think it was beneficial for to be on long term. Do you have a plan on how long you'd like to stay on em?

493^tigereye13^opiates^I didn't mean to suggest your clean time as not real if ur on MAT. I just meant for me personally. My clean date will start when I'm off all opiates. Proud of u tho. I remeber seeing your posts 180 days ago

493^tigereye13^opiate^Hmm I drink probably 5 nights a week on average.. But usually only 2 to 3 IPAs and ive never noticed that. I take kratom 3 times every day aswell. It May be that I just casually drink the beers after work over the course of like 3 hours.. So I never really get drunk. I wouldn't think the kratom would cancel or weaken the beer. When I was on hard opiates, alchohal made the opiate euphoria stronger.

493^tigereye13^opiates^Ya I'm still on it. Been like 14 months.. :(  When i got off fent/heroin i was doing about 30 gpd. Which is a lot. But not so much for people coming off hard opiates. I didn't 'feel' the kratom for at least a week. Now I am on 10 gpd and overall life is great. Soon I will finish my taper. But with tramadol it should def work bc it is a fairly weak opioid and the kratom will help with the serotonin properties trams produce.

493^tigereye13^opiates^Damn when i do opiates i get very social, do tasks ive been putting off, or can just chill. Its like am upper and downer at the same time for me

493^tigereye13^opioid^Methadone for a single relapse after months clean? That methadone may as well tingle those receptors in a control way and send him off to the races. OP. I wouldn't suggest getting on methadone unless you feel you have zero control and will die. Or if you don't want to me sober and be a synthetic opioid for a While. Either toss that shit or try and dilute it some way. Or sell it. You don't need that shit.

493^tigereye13^opiates^Glad I haven't gone through that in a couple years. On kratom now. And sometimes when im off I'll purposely not dose for like 20 hours so I can experience wd and see how bad it actually is. While its no where near traditional opiates.. It is pretty shitty. My eyes water up the same amount, mild restless, and lower back pain. Have never gone more than a day without.. So I assume i wouldn't sleep much without it. Trying to keep tapering down and hopefully jump soon.

493^tigereye13^opiates^I had a drug for a pretty good job last week. I haven't done hard opiates in a couple years but just do kratom, beer, and weed. I got the phone call last week and had 6 days to get the weed out of my system. The operating manager called me this morning saying i passed and offered me the job and i start Wednesday ! My secret is to just go in there after diluting my pee but not too much because the test could come up invalid. But drink a decent amount of water/Gatorade beforehand. Make sure you pee at least 4 or 5 times during the day before the test. Take a couple b complex vitamims to give my urine a yellow tint instead of it being clear. And take some creatine like 4 hours before so my creatine levels seem normal. Out of the 5 or 6 drug tests in my life, ive never failed and usually had smoked 5-10 days before test. May just be my metabolism and the fact i only smoke 3 or 4 times a week though.

493^tigereye13^opiate^Good job on wanting to kick your addiction. It will only get worse with time. You are likely to get a variety of answers on your question. I cant tell you an absolute but can give my experience. A couple times I used lope to combat early wds. It works. Not a godsend but it does help. Dont take massive doses that some say they do. It is not neccesary. Don't take it more than a week. First day id take like 10-15 pills so 20-30mg. Then work my way down to none over the course of the week. You don't have to take it a week either. If a couple days past and you feel ready to stop then do so. The 2nd day id take like 8 pills. Then 6, 4, 2.. 
Will it prolong the wds from those doses and length? Probably not. Maybe slightly. Like the runs will come back obviously. And you may feel restless. But that would still be the case even if you didn't take lope. Lope gets a bad rep, and sometimes rightfully so, bc ppl take huge doses for months and get hooked on it. I hear wds are not fun and super long bc of the half life. I think it is a useful drug to get clean in the right doses. You won't feel 100% better. Maybe like 50% better. Everyone is different. Even when i took it I'll still felt somewhat sick. (But my opiate usage was a lil higher than yours) I was still detoxing my body while on the lope so it was beneficiary for me. Hope this helps. Also to note. For some it takes a little while to get in the body. So the first dose on day 1 i was always frustrated. So id take another small dose (like 6 more pills) to load up. And by day 2 I would feel a lot better and could tell it's working. It is pretty benign as long as you dont exceed the 20-30mg range. Good luck

493^tigereye13^opiates^Nice. Cuban girls sexy are hell. Couple months ago this girl nearly bruised me with her boney hips lol. Not enough cushion for the pushin. Ive lost too many girls to opiates and am still single with no kids at 29. Opiates are the only drug to make me choose it rather than a life with a beautiful girl.

493^tigereye13^opiates^Yea i have to take 40mg + for good euphoria with a pretty low tolerance. Oxy hits me better and other stronger opiates obviously

493^tigereye13^opiates^Oxy doesn't come up opiates?  I could have swore my parents tested me and i failed for roxis back in the day

493^tigereye13^opiates^Oh I understand. Wish I would have tried that couple years ago lol. But just remember what you are fighting for. Things could get a lot worse quick! Continue your taper and stay positive. I know a couple nurses who use kratom. That may be an option for you as you finish your taper and would help with cravings. Especially in early sobreighty.  While it does have its own addiction potential and wds.. They are a cake walk compared to methadone and other harder opiates. It really helped me.

493^tigereye13^opiate^Wow sorry man! Use this as a cross roads in your life. With opiates things will get a lot lot worse. Trust me. Shit basically ruined my life.. Even though I just take a little Kratom now... Long term opiate usage made my mental health a lot worse and im Still repairing relationships and my life financially. Best of luck!

493^tigereye13^opiate^I know.. Everybody has different backgrounds and experience. Yet it's rare for someone to be content and happy with there life as am opiate addict. (Not neccesary talking Bout pain patients on a low to moderate dose of pills every month) yet i see a lot of posts from them as well. I never stole or became homeless cor anything like that. Never shot up. But it ruined my potential and affected my life negatively

493^tigereye13^opiates^It ain't easy being addicted to hard opiates without it affecting your life. But I guess Its possible for some

493^tigereye13^opiates^Yeah ive been on kratom for awhile now.. And obviously its lost that euphoria. But back when i used traditional opiates.. It would give me the feeling i described. Yet, that's where addiction and dependence come in.. And it ain't worth it.

493^tigereye13^opiates^Thanks for the reply. I realize 180mg on methadone is rare.. But I saw it numerous times at meetings when i got out of rehab. But I insure you I know what its like getting off heroin/fent and get onto mat drugs. I know you dont get high. I did it dozens of times. But my point was i didn't truly get happy off those drugs and didn't classify it as clean. Being on mat long term has it's negatives as well as positives. It helped millions of people, im sure. But just because it helps you doesn't mean you are 'clean'. Everybody is different. It negatively effected my life in the long term. But i appreciate you replying! Im sorry if i came off as stuck up and conceited. People told me im worthless and should burn in he'll because i think being clean is being off all synthetic and natural opiates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
494^HarmReductionStudy^opioid^Thanks so much. More responses will definitely increase the validity of the data, so I'm hoping I can get a lot. I mean basically every day I see posts about people dying, like [this one right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/erf0f5/shes_gone/) hit me really hard. People gotta realize that we have to actually do something about the problems in the world. There is a huge homeless "problem" where I live, and I ask people who complain about it "Well what have you done?". Fentanyl strips aren't perfect, but I believe that if people used them more they might take more safety measures more often, which could help. We will see what my data says but other similar studies I'll be comparing mine to have found that most opioid users are concerned about fentanyl, would use the strips, and that if they found that their sample tested for fentanyl, they would change their drug use behavior. I'm really stoked about it. Thanks for being supportive.

I can send you other studies that are similar by the way, I've compiled a huge list.

494^HarmReductionStudy^opioid^I'm doing a research project for a symposium at my school. I can send you the information about the event, and I will happily send anyone my research when it's completed.

If my research does win a prize, I will donate the entirety of that prize to a nationally recognized non-profit that I volunteer with, [Stand up For Kids](https://www.standupforkids.org/orangecounty), or a syringe exchange program in California. I will gladly post proof of this.

I do plan to continue this work after this project, though. The opioid crisis isn't going away anytime soon, unfortunately, so there is still a lot of work to be done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
495^PickleDickon^opiate^Please understand what I meant by the post. Don't compare opiates withdrawal to alcohol/ghb withdrawal. Nobody dies from opiate withdrawal in a hospital, just sometimes in prisons because of dehydration. It just doesn't increase brain activity(seizures), blood pressure and bpm to lethal levels like alcohol/ghb Withdrawal does, And benzo WD to a lesser extent

I know ill probably get hospitalised. My ghb is running low and I'm unable to get new stuff. I want the doctors to actually immediately treat me by sort of leading them into diagnosing me with severe dangerous withdrawals. If I straight up tell them what's up they wont treat me until it's too late. I already damaged my blood vessels last time I quit because of it. GABAergics withdrawals are known to be more severe(esp delirium tremens) after the first time. I think I'll die

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
496^Goofnarg^opioid^Hey everyone! 

So I just posted my feature film online because it didn't get into any festivals and I didn't want it sitting on my hard drive any longer. I made it with 11 friends over college winter break (30 days). 

I'm of course sad it didn't get in anywhere but I'm proud of the film. I didn't go to a name film school or anything like that, my school had one production course and almost everyone on set was learning their role for the first time.

I've never done anything as big as this film was (I have 7 other shorts) and let me tell you it's exhausting. A typical day for me was getting up at 3am, shoveling cars out of the snow and then filming until around 10pm, clearing cards, backing up footage, etc. until about 12am and then setting the alarm for 3am again.

The story was a bit of a personal one for me about the opioid crisis that is currently happening in the US right now. I really wanted to show the main character (James) as an addict that we don't normally see in television/film. Not a monster but an actual human looking for something to latch on to. 

I hope at least one of you gets a chance to check it out and I'm always open for critique no matter how big or how small.

Thank you!

497^psychonautgrind^toys^I knew him for at least a few weeks. We liked the same books and toys. I think my parents themselves would have found the address, I don't think I knew mine at that age. The sudden move up north and the assurance that I was wrong and that the kid was the one I had told them about left me pretty doubtful. I see his face a lot in my head ever since I remembered it all

498^KornikusPC^black^omg u actually got the black dust stuff in there holy shit I thought I was the only one

It feels all greasy and prickly to touch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
499^bigslendy^black^Lmao I'm in a fraternity and we definitely have this culture. One time I was trippin and this black out drunk bitch was tryna explain to me how all drugs are bad but completely disregarded alchohol. I gave her facts about alcohol related deaths and she got all mad and defensive. I try not to be biased against alcohol but jeez seeing people like that really proves all of my points. Most of my brothers learned that when I trip I become a better person so the people around me are good, just need more people that can tripüòÇ.

502^PhillyBirds89^opiates^Im sorry u gotta go thru that bro that really sucks. I know theres tons of ppl out there in ur same position just trying to live life without pain but idk if painkillers are a solution. Just bc if tolerance keeps increasing fast it wont be sustainable forever. I know im biased bc im an addict and have been burned bad by these kind of drugs but when i see posts like urs that arent using recreationally i still wonder if there are better options out there than opiates or opioids whatever the fuck. Plus with all the shit going on with the dea and crackdowns of prescriptions if i were u id exhaust all other options 1st b4 going to pills as a longterm solution. Just my opinion tho. I hope ur able to get back to enjoying life and not deal with pain constantly

502^PhillyBirds89^opiates^Ur halfway there man. U got past ur drug issues now get out there and live ur life. Get stuff done that u want to do. The only thing holding u back now is u. Good luck. And congrats on staying off opiates.

502^PhillyBirds89^opiate^Hes talking about the bupe. The naxolone doesnt really do anything. If u dont have a high opiate tolerance that amount will make u throw up

502^PhillyBirds89^opiates^I wish i would of never tried opiates but even if i didnt i would of been using other drugs for sure. Idk if i would of actually became addicted to anything else tho. But tbh im way more grateful for things in my life now after going thru horrible times from my addiction. Hopefully im able to stay sober and be able to look back years and years from now to look at my addiction as a hard learning experience and leading me to be a better more compassionate person. I just try to take any bad situation in my life and turn it into a positive one.

502^PhillyBirds89^opiates^30mg of oxy isnt a high dose to us but give it to someone who doesnt do opiates and they will prob get pretty sick. When i started on pills i was only doing half an oc 80 a day and the wd still sucked. Nothing compared to fentdope wd tho. That shit is unreal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
503^ThePyrofox^gum^Prolly from chewing them when you're gurning, get some gum and take some magnesium before you roll

504^qui9^opioid^Uhhh what. Exactly where did you read that the White House was warned about the opioid epidemic?

504^qui9^opiates^So I've been trying to get off and stay off heroin for years. I stopped in April of 2019, and started ketamine infusions in May. I picked up again in November and stopped in December about four weeks later. But honestly, from April to November, that seven months was the longest clean time I've ever had. Your mileage may vary, I guess.

Addiction is fucking hard. I run an [opiates recovery discord server](https://discord.gg/dC9MaKs), it's not very big but it's a great place to discuss pretty much anything if you need someone to talk to or just listen. Please feel free to join us if you ever feel like it.

504^qui9^dreams^I feel similar a lot of the time. I wish I had an answer for you. When I'm really depressed I get so upset that I'm an addict, that I'll always be that way, and I feel useless and hopeless.

What do you like to do? What is it that when you do it, you're in the moment? For me, it's music and singing and performing in general. And I'm half way decent at it. It feels amazing, better than drugs ever could. I took some steps to start doing that a little bit every day. Singing in the car more, listening to music I love instead of turning on the TV, picking up an instrument again and not judging myself for how bad I am at it.

Since I've started doing this, and it's only been maybe ten days, I've felt miles better about myself. I'm not just a heroin user. I'm a person with hobbies and dreams.

504^qui9^black^I've been depressed since I was a child. I've been on antidepressants and other psychiatric meds since I was ten or eleven years old. I've been in therapy for that long, too. I've tried so many different treatments for my depression, and sometimes they work - for a little bit. It may be placebo effect, eventually I find myself depressed again and not willing to keep throwing money at my problem. Sometimes I just resign myself to the fact that I'll always be this way and I should just accept that I'll always feel miserable.

I've been doing ketamine treatments since mid May of last year. In the beginning it really worked, I really did improve. But as time went on - well, [here's my mood monitor chart](http://imgur.com/a/ex3ORUn). The black lines are infusions. I had an infusion two weeks ago, and two weeks prior to that, and I'm currently in the "moderately severe" category of depression according to the PHQ-9. I don't know if I need another one or if I need to give it a break and keep waiting. I'm not currently suicidal (I was three weeks ago) so I guess I got that going for me. And at $500 a pop, I'm not sure I can keep affording it. Especially since I just lost my job. My mom has been very gracious in helping me out lately with the cost, but of course there's a lot of shame and guilt that goes along with that. I know everyone just wants me to be better, but at some point I have to give up and accept my fate, right? I don't know.

I guess my point is that you're not alone. I don't know what to do next either. I've tried TMS. I have not tried ECT but my memory is already shitty and I don't want to make that worse. Plus, ECT seems scary.

504^qui9^opiates^I started a discord server for opiates recovery coming up on three years ago I wanna say? Something like that. Lots of people stop in when they need to vent and leave when they're doing better, but some people stick around for a while. You can build some neat relationships with people you get to know very well inwardly but might not be able to recognize in public.

If you or anyone else ever wants to check it out, the link is in the sidebar of this subreddit.

504^qui9^opiates^Hey. I have treatment resistant major depression, generalized anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. I'm in my late twenties and I've been on psychiatric meds since I was eleven. I feel you on the life long mental illness. Often I feel like I use when my level of self loathing reaches a height, and I feel trapped and unable to cope. I'm not using opiates or hard drugs at all but I'm smoking weed and a couple weeks ago I had some ciders - I'm not really drinking because alcohol makes me feel nauseous lately.

So like, I feel like I can empathize somewhat. If you wanna talk, I'm always on discord, and my PMs are open, hell I'd be okay giving you my number. Definitely talk about how you feel. It helps.

505^rundncc^chocolate^When I was like 7 I had some Cookie Crisp cereal and found some ants in the bowl and from then on out, all I can see is little ants floating around in the milk instead of the lil baby chocolate chips lol. I feel for you

505^rundncc^black^Idk if I would classify it as a nightmare, a sleep paralysis episode, or a literal ghost, but when I was like 9 I remember seeing a guy who kinda resembled Sirius Black sitting on my dresser strangling himself pretty aggressively lol. I couldn‚Äôt scream or make a sound and I remember being terrified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
506^LukeyStrikes^opiates^Well I live in Switzerland, not Sweden, it is a great country indeed. Switzerland is right next to Germany. Docs are less hesitant, compared to the U.S, to prescribe opiates as far as I have seen. Treatment is available. There still is a stigma over it yeah, and Fent hit the streets already (lucky us to be shocked by it). But if you‚Äôre willing to make sure you get real pharma pillies and are willing to pay the little extra, compared to shit, fent containing pressies, you can get clean shit. Again, not as bad as you guys have it. I read an article, few days ago, that swiss docs tend to prescribe opioids 2.8 times more than 10 years ago, hence ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of pharma available rn, although voices are becoming loud, being concerned with the epidemic, so that may have an impact on what‚Äôs available in the next 2-5 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
507^HeavyFinesse^black^really only giveaway on the black NR is the holes that are supposed to be on the side of the yeezys , your static‚Äôs seem to have those , can‚Äôt find anyone w/ 1:1 black NR‚Äôs tho :/

508^sskor^opium^Opiates are derived directly from or by processing the opium poppy, or *Papaver somniferum*. They are part of a larger class of drugs called opioids, which are generally drugs that operate on the opioid receptors in the brain.

508^sskor^opioid^60 mg of 2-MAP237 felt like a hydro with no tolerance but with a bit more mental euphoria. It has decent legs, more so than some of your more traditional Opioid RCs but less than, say, O-DSMT.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
509^Th3Arcit3c^opiate^I have a similar background. 
 
The answer is taper. Kratom is legal and cheap. Are you going to say you dont have the will power or self controll to taper?? If so ask yourself, does it take more willpower to taper, or to CT ? 

I tried CT and realized it takes more willpower for me to get past day 2 and 3, just like the heroin wds I went thru for ten years. I couldn't taper heroin, the high was too euphoric, and irresistible. But Kratom isnt..


You can do it. But if you really feel you cant taper, give your stash to someone who will distribute it to you and be accountable for you. 

Drop one gram over your dosing per week. Stick to it, there wont be as painful. 

Smoke 24 cigs a day, if you smoke 23 a day for thre next 4 days your body and mind wont feel it.  Apply this concept to your kratom all the way down. 

You can do this if you really want to do this painlessly. Remember how bad opiate wd week is ? Why pay that concenquence for kratom, we didnt get the good highs like H, but at the end, the concenquence is the same, but doesn't have to be. Taper !!!


 üòéüëç you can do this

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiates^And what sucks is, the lack of transparency in this documentary is working against the movement. 

WebMD says kratom is as dangerous as fentanyl. That is ridiculous of course. It makes them look blindly stupid, or in denial. 
This documentary says its not addictive. Ok, so if for some it's not. So is that what everyone is to expect?  Of course not, that's not what is common. 

People if you' really believe it's not addictive. Head over to quittingkratom forum, the 10s of thousands of people all there must be just lying or so dumb it's the symptoms they had before it..

4 to 6 days of insomnia, diarrhea,  restless leg syndrome, obsessive cravings for anything to make it stop, temperary depression, anxiety attacksx etc,, now does that happen to everyone, no of course not, but dont you think it should be included, doesnt it make them look deceptive. ?? 

Hiding what can be found google search from any forum after forum of physical dependence that is definitely not  anything like caffine withdrawal Ffs. 

Be in denial folks, maybe you dont have these issues but thousands and thousands do. Yet it's not mentioned,,,   hmmmm.......

I take it 3x daily and all for it STAYING legal.  But I don't need to leave out pretty important facts about it to convince someone it's good. That's the wrong way going about it. 

Imagine you're gonna vote about this issue, you know nothing about it, you see the documentary so you're intrigued. Then you google or reddit or see the detox centers of people going thru Hell (not for for all, but SOME) , and then wouldn't you wonder to yourself why they left that out? I'd see it as deceptive, and assume it must be bad and vote it down.... 

Since when is something on fucking TELEVISION more creditable than thousands and thousands of people's experiences? 

 Stop being a blind sheep like webmd is as well. Be 100% transparent if ya want it to remain legal.  

I mean alcohol causes physical depndance and is addicting,, and people get outta control on it. That doesn't mean we lie about it to keep it legal,?? And it has NO medical value or saves you from ANYTHING. 

So many pros outweigh the cons anyhow.  Like you can't  OD, no cns depression,, its cheap easy to make. So much more going for it than prescription opiates. We dont need to hide the truth or lie to get it pushed thru. 

It's a magical thing in itself.

P.S. edited for typos sorry üòé

Thank you for humbly coming to my TedxTalk folks ! Careful on your journey home ! üëç

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiates^It is a state of mind to an extent..... BUTA,, there are PHYSICAL changes. The physical changes are what make it a disease by definition unfortunately. 

When opiates, gaba drugs (xanax ex.) are used in excess, or longterm, it  Actually changes the brain. The frontal cortex is responsible for reasoning, common sense and process thinking.  Once physically dependent and addicted, the frontal cortex activity depletes to almost no activity, and your fight or flight gland hypothalamus gland takes over. 

When you're without the drug, the hypothalamus triggers adrenaline and the fight or flight response, a panic, compulsing you to get more. 

Literally you struggle and do things that would harm yourself to get your drug of choice. Reasoning and common sense is out the door.

At that point it literally isnt willpower anymore. You're unable to think properly, because of the PHYSICAL change.

This reason is the only reason the medical field has accepted it as a disease. And it's why insurance companies will pay 40,000 dollars for a month of treatment. If it weren't classed as a disease, it would have to come out of your pocket...  so this is a scientific fact, that is a GOODZ THING. It's why people now have empathy for addicts !! 

They can get ya off the drugs. But only GOD can fix the physical brain change that has happened. Your disease .

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiate^The efficiency, potency to the receptors. Higher affinity the quicker and the higher the tolerance will build. Meaning a mean ass withdrawal. 

Like phenibut has a  crazy affinity. For most, 3 or 4 days in a row, withdrawal syndrome happens. Most narcotics take weeks to months or even years for some.  For this to happen. 

Xanax causes a pretty quick tolerance and dependence not just because of the affinity at the receptor site, but also because of the short half life. 

Drugs with short half lifes cause a quick rapid withdrawal like say 4 to 6 days, but it's a profound withdrawal. 

Where as drugs like suboxone have a huge half life,(48 to 72 hrs)  which still  causes a withdrawal, but usually for most not as violent of an withdrawal, but it will last longer like 2 to 3 weeks of it. 

Heroin withdrawal is crazy violent when I went thru it, for like 4 to 5 days.  When I withdrawald from suboxone it wasnt as bad for me, but lasted for almost a month. (Heroin = high affinity at opiate receptors with a 6 to 8 hour half life, where suboxone is less efficient compared to heroin, BUT the half life is 48 to 72 hours vs 8 hour half life like heroin) 

Hope that all makes sense. 

Sorry I'm withdrawing as we speak from kratom lol. On the 3 day, no sleep yet since last dose ugh why do I do this to myself ?? 
Krstom got me off heroin, but now I wd from it ! It's no different feeling accept I feel I got ripped off because i didn't get the blissful highs like heroin gave, but I'm still paying for it now !!

Edited for typos,,,FUK üòé

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiate^It is possible. I know this isnt relative to you, but when I went thru oxy withdrawal, perc 30s, I used meth for 4 days if it, past the peak, then after just had insomnia of course. And an hour or two of restlessness for 3 or 4 days at night once the lights were out and trying to sleep.

Which I'm sure some of that was the meth comedown. 

But even tho meth doesnt hit the opiate receptor, and obviously not cocaine, but the high from the meth I believe was just more intense than the withdrawls from the oxy. 

I was at the end of the oxy taper I had done over 3 weeks üòéüëç

2 years clean in March üí™

509^Th3Arcit3c^black^First time I ever injected coke, I started shaking uncontrollably. Freaked me the fuck out. Like a seizure but completely alert and awake for it.  Ironically it didn't scare me away..

Instead I started cooking down crack in a spoon, added a little  vinegar and or vitamin C to break it down and make it  injectable since it's not water soluable like powder.
 Is, then  I'd  injected it. 5 dollar feels like 20 dollars of  blow. With no grinding of the teeth. But the come up on it was insane. Totally flooded with sweat instantly, feeling like yore in a pizza oven. 

That I OD'd on for sure. I kept injecting crack, then started mixing my heroin in with it, for one injection together.. (I know right, fucking idiot right?) . I remember hearing the ringing in my ears, then everything went black. Next thing I woke up to someone doing CPR on my chest trying to pump my heart. Never, ever, ever did that again. 

Never touched cocaine again, and that's when I started my 2 yr battle to get off H.

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiates^Of course people new to it have a hard on for the documentary since its the only one of it kind with at least SOME info on it. But big factors have been left out. 

If I were one of the people that go thru bad withdrawals,  and based my use on that documentary alone, I'd be fucking pissed, and my hard-on would be at wanting to get it  banned. 

We dont need people backsliding, that are for it in the 1st place then later feel deceived. In my state alone just under 3,000 overdose deaths due to opiates that ARE NOT KRATOM..

Kratom has less than 100 known "accusations" of related deaths. Mostly with other drugs involved. So there is  their example of blind faith,  on the  opposing  side as well. 

This documentary should be called Leaf of Blind Faith.
It needs redone, maybe when they made it they were clueless as to this. But I don't think so. 

Re do the documentary, put in all facts. The truth shall set you Free ! 

Let's keep it legalized folks !

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiate^The post was so long I guess adding the past opiate history wouldn't of made it much worse üôÑ

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiate^I have to be honest.  I am 2 yrs clean off an opiate addiction of 10yrs. With opiates I have major issues. 

Had gabapentin Rx and klonopin Rx for years never had issues with them off and on thru the Dr. They were lower dose. A few times I took a few extra klonopin but it just made me sleep too much, felt best st .5mg. 

But opiates are another story, a nightmare for me ! 
I'm in my 40s now . I guess being scared of another nightmare again I stay humble.

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiates^Then after a week, the ten dollars worth does nothing. Then ya need 20. And so on.... then 100 dollars does nothing. So then ya agree to inject it (even tho ya promise yourself you'd never do that), after the 1st injection, 10 bucks feels like 200 dollars worth snorted... so it feels like injecting is the answer to being able to afford it... 

Then you guessed it, a week later, 10 dollars IV'd wontdo it.Then ya inject 20, and a week later etc......

Then before ya know it, ya dont even get high or any pleasure from it, and chasing it daily is just to stave off withdrawals, just to feel normal and able to function.. 

Then after some time doing it, if ya get a kidney stone or something requiring pain meds in the hospital , they won't touch the pain. Your tolerance gets so high, the amount of pain meds ya need to get rid of the pain they wont give that much afraid you will OD. 

Even after almost a year of no opiates, it's like I have permanent tolerance. What would make someone almost OD, , doesnt even touch my pain !! 

After all this I look back, with nothing but regret. 

I know you were oy asking about doing it once. But realize this, EVERY heroin addict only intended on trying it, and never thought they would get to the point they'd inject ... its madness , the insanity of it is insane

509^Th3Arcit3c^opiates^Actually now you say it, when I use phenibut I smoke cigarettes like a mad man. I bet it is related to gaba agonists maybe...  same when I drink..

But ya right on, my buddy told me he took gabapentin for a week once and he claimed it was like xanax WD, but not quite as severe. I was scared to stop taking my phenibut. 

I'm with you sort of on enjoyment of gaba substances. I do not enjoy the high at all. I took 1.5grams once of phenibut and did not enjoy it whatsoever. Gave me a bad headache, and remember the veins in my temples looked as thick as the ones in my forearm. 

I think it's why I haven't chased the dosage up higher and higher. One day I take 500mgs, the next I might take 1.2grams. Never been over 1.2, and never been under 500mgs. I find that is the right dose I get the calming effects from, without making me feel like I want to sleep, and no need for caffine at this dose. I look back and have no days where I think to myself that it's not working, or need to take more. 

I think it's from not taking set doses each day. I've never taken the same dose two days in a row. It always fluctuates daily. 

Kratom and opiates on the other hand, I have to taper taper taper, and still WD some when I stop. I dont get it.

510^ShivasKratom3^toys^Is this actually cool? A random dude minding his business possibly on the spectrum being laughed at online by strangers for OPs internet points? We don‚Äôt know the guy or the story but we are laughing at a kid and his toys cowardly taken by photograph from behind

512^iceninekillsCTE^toys^Free is unlikely unless you find a blessed soul on here. Cheap, check out the WTS section of this forum. Many people resell their toys and it's safe and they sanitize them. If she's not a size queen you can find a small or mini on here for $60, sometimes less. Larger toys you can usually find around $100 which is still a 50% discount over buying new

513^gratefulwhomps^cruz^Yeah thats what it seems like i can get most drugs really easily in my town 
mdma,L,shrooms,coke,k,and all that other shit in one simple phone call.  Saw dancesafe or bunkpolice posted about a pressie in santa cruz that was sold as mdma but was actually 2cb right about the same time i was there for a festival and was hoping so badly id bump into the guy selling those lol üòÇ

514^Ayanith^opiates^Yeah I don‚Äôt enjoy benzos anyway I only use them when I can‚Äôt sleep but that‚Äôs about it they make me feel weird. What I love about opiates is that you keep a pretty clear head

514^Ayanith^opiates^Could you tell me how the Pregabalin feels I‚Äôve been considering getting some since I got off opiates!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
515^OGSkywalker97^opiates^Maybe in the US/Canada. But in Europe no one would be prescribed opiates for having teeth removed, you'd  be told to take Ibuprofen and paracetamol. The max you'd get is some 8mg codeine/paracetamol pills.

515^OGSkywalker97^opiates^I know it activates them, but once it binds to the receptors it blocks other classic opiates from binding. Sort of like buprenorphine.

515^OGSkywalker97^opioid^Even before the opioid crisis you wouldn't get more than ibuprofen in the UK, especially for a 13 yr old üòÆ. Maybe some co-codamol if it's bad.

515^OGSkywalker97^opiates^I just take 2 capsules a day. Really helps with stress and anxiety for me. It has even been shown to reverse damage to neurones caused by stress. It also reduces cortisol levels.

But basically I noticed my tolerance wasn't increasing very fast compared to what I'd heard and I looked into it. I found a study showing that the spine density of dopamine receptors remained the same when using ashwagandha with opiates. (Simply put)

Normally when you continuously take opiates the amount of dopamine receptors decreases, and they become down regulated (meaning they are less sensitive to dopamine, so require more of it for the same response). This is a big part of what leads to tolerance so ashwagandha really aids in slowing this down and maintaining tolerance. 

I made a post about it if you wanna take a look. You can also google 'ashwagandha and opiates' and the study should show up, although it's quite technical.

Edit: I'd highly recommend using KSM-66 ashwagandha as it has the highest concentration of withanolides, which are what contribute to reduced stress and maintaining tolerance.

515^OGSkywalker97^opiates^Ashwagandha has been proven to help prevent tolerance build up from opiates. It prevents down regulation of dopamine receptors in the spine.

516^amebz^black^I made progress for the first time yesterday! - I tried a few times before but got no sensation beyond a mild body high.

Everything went black and white and ‚Äúcartoony‚Äù to start, except for this circle of colourful chains/ropes moving. 

Then I saw an entity that looked like a mountain, and it was beckoning me up a path, there was the spot of light behind it, but if I lost focus it disappeared. The colours were amazing. 

There were these mechanical Aztec number looking things that kept trying to make me laugh ... it was like a giant prank ... but then I‚Äôd laugh and realise it wasn‚Äôt a prank and my laughing would re-ground me and I‚Äôd lose the path. 

I found the sounds in my real world distracting and it seemed to hold me back, and the overall message I got was ‚Äúlet go of your anchors‚Äù. But they meant everything - the noises, light, my body, my family, everything. And I found that too scary to contemplate, so I ended up in this room... it was still amazing, but I knew then I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere somehow. 

It was unreal. I wish I had the ability to draw or paint the things I saw.

I didn‚Äôt find it scary, and I don‚Äôt feel standoffish about doing it again... but I think I need to figure out how to ‚Äúlet go of my anchors‚Äù.

516^amebz^gum^My son is autistic, and likes chewing. He is still in preschool, but I‚Äôve been reading about appropriate ‚Äúchewing outlets‚Äù.

There are pen toppers - or what about chewing gum?

517^raisingwildflowers2^toys^Yeah the 10 was ok the 15 was a killer. But I done it anyway instead of buying toys for my kids. Kills me. Yeah I was spending right at 525 a week of my hubby's hard earned money and lying where it was going. I'm so ashamed but relieved it's over. I'm trying not to best myself down because all it will do is depress the hell outta me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
518^Terukii^china^About the protest in Hong Kong against the Carry Liam regiment. And about the occupation of the various universities. 
It shows what the young population is going through, what they sacrifice to be independent from China. 
It's in German tho. But I posted it anyway to show you guys, that the media in other countries does not ignore what happens in Hong Kong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
519^BrownKidMaadCity^black^And that's why you have to question people when you read bullshit like that. You're telling me black people can't/don't travel outside of western Europe and NA?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
520^lifeguardoren^opiates^Small town in Kansas/Missouri border, so not much luck with good deals.

But uhh,

Oxy polls - 1$/mg unless u find someone selling a lot they may cut you a deal 

Hydros are about 25-50¬¢/per mg

Heroin here(tar) is either 20$/button, 60$/half g, or 100$/full g, and for China it‚Äôs tar to see but they usually ask 30/button and 90/half g, never seen a gram of china here in the two years I‚Äôve been using.

Oh and for non opiates, a gram of coke for 95$, and about half a gram of meth for 30$.

520^lifeguardoren^china^Hmm that‚Äôs actually a really good idea, I never thought about that since it‚Äôs tar, not China or powder, but that could actually work.

Thank you for that idea, and you‚Äôre right about it being bad practice. I don‚Äôt even sell shit, I just use, but I ran out of luck lately and haven‚Äôt had cash, so I offered some people that use a good deal except I messed up and dropped one so it‚Äôs my fault absolutely, but I still gotta pay my plug back no matter what.

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^Oh shit, yeah the ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù are a real thing actually, usually associated with getting off of SSRIs. I was on Zoloft for like a month (so that I could eventually get on klonopin) and when I got off I had the brain zaps! It‚Äôs a weird sensation for sure. And with opiates I feel more like my brain is constricting during WDs and my skin is crawling.

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^Seizures form stopping opiates? Shit that scares me now. Does that happen, or is it because of all of the crazy fent analogues now (assuming the pills OP is getting now might be pressed)?

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^Another thing to add is to try exercising. I know everything in your body and mind is telling you it‚Äôs impossible, but just try to force yourself to run or bike. Perhaps even lift some weights if you‚Äôre near a gym, so your restless muscles have something to do. 

I just cut from 4 to 2mg once daily, and while WDs have only been mild, I‚Äôve been forcing myself to run 35 minutes after work and alternate arm and leg days as well (because I get RLS and restless arms). I‚Äôm Also taking magnesium glycinate. Hope that helps!

Edit: will also produce natural endorphins/‚Äúnatural opiates‚Äù in the brain. You WILL feel better after, I promise you won‚Äôt regret it.

522^Thedopedaze^opioid^I had success with Linzess, but it‚Äôs not specifically for opioid induced constipation. It‚Äôs a prescription and I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a generic yet. Of course my insurance no longer covers it tho, so I‚Äôve just been taking magnesium.

522^Thedopedaze^opiate^Someone said burn in hell? Jeez, people take this sub too seriously sometimes. I take your post as what it is- an opinion (yours) for a sub that promotes honest discourse about this type of stuff. The worst thing that could ever happen is for this place to become a complete echo chamber. 

I am on subs and consider myself ‚Äúclean‚Äù I guess because I‚Äôm not seeing a dealer everyday, spending all of my money, lying to people and basically ruining my life. HOWEVER...I‚Äôm not myself again yet, not 100% anyways. It has served its purpose for me at this point, and your line about not progressing in your career and continuing to isolate while on it resonated with me. I hate being on subs now, every day is like a 5/10. I‚Äôm still tired a lot. But they likely saved my life earlier on in my recovery. I‚Äôve been tapering, but the upcoming WDs I‚Äôll inevitably have to deal with are scaring the shit outta me. 

My point is...I wish I had just gotten this over with early on and dealt with just the H withdrawals, but back then I wouldn‚Äôt have been in the mental place to stop yet. So it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. Subs helped me get the ‚Äúclean‚Äù life so that my thinking could finally change enough to be able to handle these upcoming WDs without turning to dope. I‚Äôm ready now, but it took years. It‚Äôs going to be difficult, but I know the payoff of never needing ANY type of opiate when I wake up to feel normal will be so worth it.

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^Lots of good advice in these comments. It‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs always a matter of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù (not ‚Äúif‚Äù), and once you realize or experience how scary things can get...it‚Äôs much easier to finally stop. Sure, being on opiates is an amazing feeling (and so was the rush), but thinking ‚ÄúI can keep this up forever‚Äù has zero logic behind it. I seriously thought at one point that the party never had to be over. 

Otherwise, if you know you‚Äôll have to stop someday anyways, why not stop now?

522^Thedopedaze^opiate^I definitely clench my teeth day and night when I start to withdraw, definitely gives me those temple headaches. Unrelated to hypertension but still a headache related to opiate use nonetheless.

522^Thedopedaze^opiate^This is so weird...I was diagnosed with hypothyroid, with nodules too, RIGHT after I quit and got on suboxone. I started gaining weight rapidly, more so than the normal ‚Äúgetting clean‚Äù weight and was diagnosed like 6 months later. 

There‚Äôs no history of it in my family or anything else. I know it‚Äôs common, but I seriously think it‚Äôs linked to opiate use somehow or maybe even suboxone. I was only a user for a couple of years. I wish there were more studies on this...idk. 

I know opiates can be tough on the endocrine system, but I doubt tons of legitimate pain patients who take prescriptions regularly have these sorts of thyroid issues. Otherwise we‚Äôd be hearing about it on top of all of the other opiate lawsuits and whatnot going on right now. Interested to hear if you know of any studies or even something anecdotal related to this.

522^Thedopedaze^opioid^Agreed. I hate when people say that on the news, articles and/or even movies/shows when they try to cover & portray the opioid epidemic. Like no, that barely scratches the surface and is not why people get stuck in this cycle for years. It‚Äôs the mental torture. 

Trainspotting is the only thing that comes to mind as far as getting it right and capturing that aspect accurately. In that movie, even after the WDs are done Renton is bored & unmotivated, not feeling like himself,  right before he ODs while on methadone.

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^Agreed that mental torture is the absolute worst part, which is why I hate when people who have never used opiates or gone through withdrawal act like it‚Äôs the exact same thing as the flu. Sure, the physical symptoms are similar (runny nose and sneezing, GI issues etc) but I‚Äôve never had a flu that‚Äôs completely mentally debilitated me. People don‚Äôt keep using because they‚Äôre afraid of getting the flu for 4-7 days. We/they keep using because they‚Äôre afraid of the mental hell that comes next, and fucking lingers well after the physical WDs are gone. 

So yes, for me it‚Äôs the mental part, plus the restless legs (and sometimes arms) that kept me up all night and resulted in no sleep for days on end. Also the weird brain fuzzyness that also feels like my head is like, constricting/the pressure on it sometimes? Idk hard to explain but I‚Äôm sure you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Lack of motivation is awful, I‚Äôll throw that in with the mental torture. Then second comes all of the weird smells and genital tingling ! Haha

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^My hair thinned about a year after going on suboxone, which coincided with being diagnosed with hypothyroid. Once I got on levothyroxine for a while and switched to head & shoulders, it got better. I also take biotin now, but it got better before that. 

For me, it was less of a side effect and more related to hypothyroid. I‚Äôve seen other women saying they were diagnosed after going on subs, too. It could be subs or opioid addiction or something else, idk. But opiates are definitely hard on the endocrine system.

522^Thedopedaze^opiates^It‚Äôs so weird because I‚Äôve seen other people saying stuff like this about opiates in general but have never found anything about it (agreed w/ subs too). Yeah, I never got ‚Äúsick sick‚Äù on heroin either. It‚Äôs weird, some people chock it up to the lack of socialization during addiction, and isolating yourself more therefore you don‚Äôt get sick. But on Suboxone we‚Äôre back out in the world, working, seeing friends and family again etc. I only very recently got a mild sore throat thing, but it was manageable and I didn‚Äôt miss any work. Everyone else seemed to be getting sick, and I finally caught it once I dropped my sub dose to 4MG lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
523^Psychedelic-Autism^black^I charged my old roommate $200 (I was paying about $1000 after utilities) a month and all he did was steal from me. Not even just money, he stole my clothes because he refused to wash anything. He had neon yellow shorts that were black when I moved out because he did not wash him once in the months he was there. He also only showered once every three weeks. He also destroyed the apartment, not just with things like puke on the walls but also actual damage from him throwing temper tantrums and smashing things. In fact his third day there he smashed my spare PS4 controller that I let him borrow and then came up and asked to borrow another because "it stopped working." No shit it stopped working, it was in pieces

It all came down when I caught him wearing my dead best friends shirt that he stole from the bottom of my dresser (which was then ruined from his smell). All the months of stealing money, drugs, and even shit like expensive drawing pens (that he used to write Walking Dead fanfics) from me came out at once and I beat the guy with a pickaxe. I'm quite sure he is homeless now if he is even alive. I know he got arrested for burglarizing his grandmother's house (who raised him) on three separate occasions

If you're wondering where the pickaxe came from, he was so dead set on never paying rent that when I kicked him out he stole a pickaxe off some dude's porch and was going to dig a fort in the "woods" by the house. It was a fucking tree line at a park

I could go on for days about this guy. Every single day he pissed me off further

523^Psychedelic-Autism^black^Its happening in a lot of fight subs right now. /r/brutalbeatdowns is getting exceptionally awful. Theres 20 "13%" type comments on any video with black people. Even though about half the videos are white people and there are a lot of asian/middle eastern ones too. Honestly the most fucked videos in the sub are from Russians or asians

523^Psychedelic-Autism^black^I grew up in an entirely white area that was poverty stricken (by entirely white I mean we literally had one black kid and he was adopted by white parents)

This was common sight. My neighbor and best friend was a molly dealer and stabbed at 12. 4 of my friends were dead before i graduated high school. One couple in my high school was "famous" in the area for robbing a store at shotgun point while the girl was pregnant. My ex's brother was arrested for dressing up like a cop and robbing a drug dealer with a fake warrant (he was caught in 20 minutes). All in a town so small my graduating class was less than 100 kids

It's not a black thing, it's a poor thing. Hell I've hit people while they're down similar to the video. I actually made a kid blind in his right eye in high school because I kicked him in the eye after a fight. I'm white

I wouldn't do it now but it's not like anyone teaches you as a kid how bad it is or how easy it is to cause permanent damage. You just see it happen, it happens to you, so you do it to others. Telling people not to hit each other does jack shit when someones kicking your ass every day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
524^Free-Assc-For-Asians^black^I found that my autistic/aspie symptoms were lack of HDL cholesterol from prolongued stress from parental abuse and a poor diet from lack of allowance to experience my own autonomy. Though it may feel dense and tricky, eat animal fats and meat and dairy then after close your mouth with your tongue at the roof of your mouth, breathe through the nose in and out to get digesting and tap your stomach and front to get gas out.

&#x200B;

In general people with health issues and mental issues were abused and fed a shitty diet on par with the ignorance of parents

A lot of retarded parents do not realise that our self control part of our brain is FILLED with sperm, which we can only produce if we have HDL Cholesterol.

&#x200B;

You may have heard of the "Alkaline vegan diet" well this is bullshit propaganda, sperm is made by eating meat, sperm is an alkaline highly dense in energy fluid that the body potentiates by its self over time. 

I did at first with all this extra energy experience psychosomatic rage and anguish, but as my body synchronised with the elevated energy, I started to see in more than a black and white dimension, I remember things that I really thought I forgot forever.

If you wanna start off building your energy, try feasting on fatty animal foods, milk, butter (not marg) and have no sugar or carbs

supplementing Zinc, vitd, magnesium calcium and a big multivitamin as well as a Melatonin pill before bed will reverse all problems you have

I hope you recover from all this fuckery. Much love.

526^israelTipsFromLocal^black^you will have really hard time finding fresh cranberries. you COULD find them in israeli-russian store's. they will be really expensive.

you will find them canned, and frozen everywhere.

about raspberry = it's rare to found fresh raspberry here, but it's doable. if you look for it on the season you will find.

just buy frozen.

notes:you would not find any raspberries now. as the season end on late november

when you will find fresh raspberries. the cost will be 20 shekels for 125 grams. that is 5 euro for 125 grams.

what i said about raspberry, is true for all the berries (blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, blackberry)

from the other hand. there is a wild black raspberry that grow EVERYWHERE in israel, but the fruits are not sweet enough most of the time. and they appear in july to dec.

i'm a huge berries addict. and i never buy fresh, i buy frozen. i can get 1 kilo of frozen blueberry \\raspberry for 30 shekels. and this is good fruits

527^TheZachatron^opiates^If you can‚Äôt get opiates try Kratom, also weed can make me feel warm in the face, sometimes Xanax gives me a warm feeling in my head as well, but the best drugs for that in my opinion are opiates and alcohol

527^TheZachatron^opiates^Yes, Benedryl as well, it will make you more sedated, I always use hydroxyzine to potentiate all my benzos and opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
528^Ringnebula13^opioid^It can be abused if taking with other drugs like loperamide (immodium). In loperamide's case this will better allow it to cross the blood brain barrier and since loperamide is a powerful opioid (just doesn't usually get into the brain) it can get you high. Omeprazole by itself isn't abusable afaik.

530^hegelunderstander^opioid^Doctors giving away prescriptions wasn't the main issue, it was what happened when the prescription ran out and then later what happened when doctors couldn't give out prescriptions anymore. Now you have chronic pain patients shooting up fentanyl to be able to function/sleep/exist, not just people who were addicted and then dropped like a rock by the government. The government and capitalist greed caused the opioid crisis, not doctors.

534^Kcmudderman^opiate^Fuck don‚Äôt use phenibut every day man. I‚Äôve tapeeed down to 3gpd now and I miss opiate wd.

534^Kcmudderman^opiates^Great fukin story man. Fuck I can relate. I‚Äôm getting my spine fused to skull in few weeks and honestly my mouth is watering for what they will give me. When I came in with a broken neck in November I guess when I was on ventilator my mom told my main doc, well he‚Äôs had a problem with opiates. I‚Äôm so pissed off now. Be a nightmare to have such a painful surgery and get some dick sprinkling hydros on me. Fuck that. But I need to be clean, but I‚Äôm gonna play for a few months

534^Kcmudderman^opiate^Worse opiate wd for me is surely restless leg/body. But now I‚Äôm going thru phenibut wd and miss me some restless leg.

534^Kcmudderman^opiate^I tried that on New Year‚Äôs Eve after tapering for months. I was down to 3gpd and I took 8/10? And had the weirdest result. All of a sudden I had the worse restless body I‚Äôve ever had. Worse than opiate wd, anything. It was a horrible couple days but I haven‚Äôt heard that from anyone else. But yea no magic. Guess it‚Äôs like any other drug. It‚Äôs gone

534^Kcmudderman^opiates^Long term kratom user 13 years in between binges of other opiates. Tapering on phenibut also and so far so good and I don‚Äôt get bad wd from zs either. I have seen psychosis from phenibut and Xanax wd so don‚Äôt think it don‚Äôt exist I just don‚Äôt get. Best ways to lower kratom. 
1. Use some kratom u don‚Äôt normally get off on. If u don‚Äôt feel red or greens use those. Only use that kra for a dose a day at first and use your normal energy kra for morning dose. 
2. Larges doses of Imodium. Not like the crazy high heart murmur stories of hundreds a day but taking 6-8-10 at a time kills the restless body shit. 
3. Getting off kratom mid a little more complex than the regular opiates. Obviously not the initial physical shit but the mental part for me is actually harder from  kra than was for subs and fent. Good luck man, I used it to get off subs again and now up to 2oz a day of white maengda still chasing the bliss energy

534^Kcmudderman^opiates^Have u ever had long times off opiates and has it ever got any better?

534^Kcmudderman^opiates^I think them calls show them how eager u are to work. 
The fact that u are paying bills and are broke from that shows u got your shit together more than u realize. I ain‚Äôt gonna downplay your depression tho bro. Ya I know how fukin hard it is but.......... you got a long time to figure out what works for ya. Rest up cuz your getting ready to work your ass off. Keep being broke from paying bills. Stick to just smoking don‚Äôt go down the road of misery with opiates. Good luck u got this

534^Kcmudderman^opiates^I know it bro 10 years here on kratom. I‚Äôve been addicted to all opiates but kratom has been the one constant between it all. Right now I‚Äôm only doing 2oz a day

534^Kcmudderman^opiate^That‚Äôs all bullshit. Kratom does not block any effects of opiates. Because it is a sort of opiate. Use kratom as your main pain reliever and the oxys for break thru pain. They don‚Äôt drown each other out, that‚Äôs ignorant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
535^Yeeted2^opiates^Heroin then, it has to be either benzos or opiates. I was coming down super hard after 3 days up I actually wanted to kill myself cuz I didn‚Äôt have either, now I won‚Äôt even do coke if I don‚Äôt have anything to come down on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
536^loudbounce^opioid^I agree they are harder to get. What worries me is what happened when opioid pain killers became harder to get when the rescheduled the class to C2 from C4, and addicted patients went to heroine. We are being flooded w/ counterfeit Xanax laced w/ fentanyl. As if real Xanax wasn‚Äôt dangerous enough.

538^swerc137^toys^PSE and GFE haven never meant included BBBJ. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs clients who have perpetuated this idea or what. 

My PSE is use of toys, light spanking, hair pulling, wild af positions, filming (on my phone for my own porn site), COB, rimming on me, light role play, a finger up the booty (either me or them), and deepthroat.

539^mayonnaise123^china^It really would be a perfect biological weapon, give the patients pneumonia but no fever and even symptomatic people would fly under the radar. I mean is it a coincidence that China has a level 4 biohazard in Wuhan and 3 weeks later 57 million are quarantined, at least 1,000 infected but that‚Äôs a ridiculously low number. Same with 47 deaths. You wouldn‚Äôt have this many exported cases nor a 57 million people quarantine without a much higher case total than is being reported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
540^ggbarkely^opioid^I can imagine so as kratom gets me pretty high when I don‚Äôt have an opioid tolerance. Moving to a pretty conservative state in a couple weeks so hopefully it‚Äôll be much harder to find and not cause any future problems

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
541^d3fault_position^black^I've been a practicing Black Metal musician since about '99, and I began incorporating elements of hypnotic repetition into my earlier music (recordings of which no longer exist, unfortunately). Needless to say, this made each song an incantation of sorts, and an exercise in subliminal transmission. I started to notice that my music could provoke fearful reactions and emotions in other people... and even myself. 

I've noticed that Black Metal (of the more "depressive," "Ambient," and "Atmospheric" varieties) has the potential to recreate what I sought to do with my own music early on: it's often repetitive, slower in tempo, easy to immerse oneself in and enhance certain emotional states. 

I would imagine that it would be good for meditative purposes, provided (of course) that one enjoys such music in the first place. Actually, tbh, it would be an interesting experiment for someone to try who *doesn't* typically enjoy such music.

541^d3fault_position^china^Had to go check it out just to satisfy my curiosity and to verify info in OP, and found this article: 

http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/04/c_136872077.htm

Not only is it the first Level 4 biolab in China, but it only went into operation in 2018. 2 years later there's an outbreak in the same province? That's mighty suspicious...

541^d3fault_position^black^Never scared me, but I do really enjoy this film. For one thing, it's visually stunning. I'm a song writer in some... darker genres.... and I'd often put this movie on with the volume off, as some Black Metal played in the background. 

Underrated movie, imo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
542^deletethefeds1776^opiates^The only time I could enjoy them was when I first started taking opiates and my tolerance was low. I loved tramadol and codeine but now my tolerance is too high

547^ShamansHawk1111^black^https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGXnXTZovvE&t=20s

This is from 2011. I'm the guy with the black V next to 'singer'. Sloppy and fun are both understatements. Definitely not my best work musically but it was still a great experience. That was our first original song, we all pretty much created it together. I think that band is now reduced to a solo project of just the singer and his guitar tracks. I don't follow it honestly. I'm more focused on recording my own music now, and practicing technique and playing with more emotion.

547^ShamansHawk1111^black^You're welcome, I love sharing things that have helped me with others seeking help.

Psychedelics have changed my life for the better too! 

The good quality Whole Nutmeg I use has a similar level of psychedelic activity as middle shelf cannabis, which personally is perfect for me. Nutmeg's psychedelic properties give me a good mood lift, feelings of mild euphoria and lasting well-being, a more POSITIVE WORLDVIEW, and kindling for creative inspiration. Sometimes I get teary from my heart opening on nutmeg, like a psychedelic spiritual cleansing. I experience all these different effects on different levels with different amounts of nutmeg. 1-2g is perfect for work. 7-15g is great for events like going to a themepark, a movie, a night out, a long trip, or even just a lazy stoney day at home playing video games. I LOVE how it lasts all fucking day and takes care of me until my head hits the pillow! I think these tiny doses work well on me because I grate my nutmeg nuts.

To answer your question on the 25 gram dose..... Did you grate or grind your original 15g dose? You do not need to ingest more nutmeg for a stoning effect! 15 grams should be way stronger for you than before if you GRATE the nuts! What brand of Nutmeg do you use? (it's possible your nutmeg may just be low quality, ingesting more will not help that..) 

You need to get a grater, or at least smash them and put them in a coffee grinder. Turn the nuts into powder in some way, because there is more surface area exposing nutmeg's special active oils, making it totally more effective! Wash back with cold water and enjoy. 

On 6 grams of nutmeg and a little black coffee, 4 hours after dosing I see shimmering on striped surfaces like vents and window blinds and I can even see faint patterns dancing between the grooves, and LOTS of motion tracers and mild colorful static, in a mild stoned haze. During this I'll feel happy and calm, maybe even feel giddy or excited if I'm doing something normal like grocery shopping or cooking at home. The whole experience is enjoyable especially with headphones ;)

To answer your question about serotonin depletion, I think too much nutmeg too often is not healthy for your brain or your body. Doses like 1-4 grams daily is not bad at all. But 10+ grams every day for over a week is too much. I get mentally and physically slow from doing too much of it like that. I get perfect results using nutmeg every other day, or 4 days on & 1 day off & repeat. 5 days on & 1 day off is pushing it. Too much nutmeg too often will not help depression, it will make you feel tired. If you find your sweet spot with nutmeg dosage intervals and caffeine, you are set for life!

I'm currently 14 hours into 3 grams of grated nutmeg as of now. Only 3 grams. I feel a nice tingle in my head, body and legs. I also have the munchies. I felt a little irritated at work today but I was definitely not miserable, I was able to be friendly with customers and co-workers and work hard through my shift, without hating life :) and that's all I could ask for. For work I combine Nutmeg with tiny doses of Kratom and L-Theanine as well.

I hope my freakishly long reply helps you. Ask me anything else if you need clarity on this.

547^ShamansHawk1111^black^Stay away from Preground Nutmeg. It's not medicine like Whole Nutmeg.

For Whole Nutmeg nuts, don't just eat them. 

Either grate the nuts with a fine(small holes) cheese grater and wash(parachute) back with water. Or smash the nuts, then grind the smashed nuts in an electric coffee grinder and then parachute the powder(harder to swallow than grated nuts). You could mix your grated or grinded nutmeg nuts in oatmeal or applesauce, but that honestly makes me gag... especially with any amount above 2 grams of nutmeg.

For me it's easiest to just grate the nuts by hand, weigh the dose, and wash back with cold water little by little. No gagging, no problems. I'll sit down and grate up to 80 grams of nutmeg in one sitting for a month's worth of dosing, so I don't have to do it every day.


Oh shit, I just remembered my NUTMEG RECIPES!!!
Sometimes.............. I'll get cookie dough from the store and infuse the cookie dough with nutmeg.... by putting one section of dough(one cookie's worth of dough at a time) in a pot on low heat with a tiny smidge of butter and 4-7 grams of grated nutmeg. I'll mix the dough and nutmeg together with a wooden spoon by rolling and kneading it together in the pot. The butter helps the nutmeg powder stick to the cookie dough. Once the dough collects the 4-7 grams of nutmeg powder, I place the dough on the baking sheet to be baked. Bake to desired texture, whether you prefer mooshy cookies, crispy cookies, or right in between. With chocolate chip, the flavor is WONDERFUL when dipped in BLACK COFFEE. That is the ultimate morning ritual. Nutmeg cookie dipped in black coffee. I called them Space Cookies.

An EASIER recipe is to mix your desired amount of grated/grinded Nutmeg powder with PEANUT BUTTER. Put some regular butter in a pan or pot, and mix your nutmeg powder with your preferred amount of peanut butter.... Add sugar to taste :) This one is ADDICTIVE. You can put it in a sandwich with jelly, or just eat it with a spoon! haha I loved this one.


Sorry I got carried away. 

Liver problems? I've been taking nutmeg regularly for almost 3 years and I've had NO KNOWN liver complications. I used to take 19 grams of nutmeg 4-5 days a week. Then I noticed that 8-12 grams of nutmeg felt easier on my body. Then lowered down to 5-8 grams regularly. By now I take 2-3 grams of nutmeg 4 days a week simply because the lower doses are very effective on me now. If I ever get liver complications, I will post on it. Until then, this stuff is honestly as harmless as weed if used responsibly.

If you drink lots of alcohol or smoke lots of cigarettes or eat lots of junk food, nutmeg may be a bad combo for you. I don't do any of these things and get wonderful effects from whole nutmeg. 

Sorry for the long post. I love this medicine.

547^ShamansHawk1111^dreams^I had a dream of a familiar person doing something to my spine, I was telling them "stop hurting my back, that hurts, stop it" and then waking up still feeling that terrible spinal pain for about 10 to 20 seconds, still saying "stop hurting my back." That was a weird one.

&#x200B;

Had something exactly the same happen to my manly parts too. That one hurt really bad, and I still felt it when I woke up >.<

&#x200B;

Yes, I feel excruciating pain in my dreams too.

547^ShamansHawk1111^black^Thank you so much for your awesome honest response. 

It must be a true blessing to know workers of these medicines that can brew it for you and guide you through the complex worlds the medicine can take you to.

I think my question of combining these two plants of power comes from my personal longing and coveting of Ayahuasca (I bet she will kick my ass for this when I finally meet her...). I've tried brewing it at least 5 times and failed each time. I did this with gentle singing, prayers and wholesome intentions the best I could. A reliable Ayahuasca recipe is a subject for another thread, and there's already TONS of threads on it. Good ones too. 

To be fair, once on an attempted Aya brew, I briefly floated through a space/ star tunnel with closed eyes, and later saw a perfect circle in black darkness, and the circle led to a place with blue skies and tan desert mountains, and the circle was framed by a series of small benevolent eyes. I wanted to go there but it was too distant. This was with Chacruna (diplopterys cabrerana) and Caapi. I combined Chacruna, Chaliponga and Caapi once and it did nothing but clear my digestive system. I was hoping the Mimosa Hostilis would work better, since I've read tons of experiences using this ingredient with wonderful results.

If there's anything else you would like to share on the subject, please feel free to.

547^ShamansHawk1111^opiate^It's no problem, ask away!


YES, I say Kratom is in fact a stimulant because, 1, I cannot sleep after consuming kratom. Red Sumatra is said to be the most relaxing and pain killing strain, and I could not sleep until it wore off. I was laying awake going through all these social scenarios, goals, memories, just thought after thought. At that time I think I drank a 1 gram tea of that Red Sumatra. Someone close to me who tried kratom for pain relief at night had trouble sleeping too.

2, The outdoor laborers in the SouthEast Asian islands and countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc, this is where Kratom and Nutmeg come from!) love Kratom and drink it throughout the day. It relieves them of their tiredness and gives them energy to do intense physical labor all day. They pronounce it kruh-TOM and they chew the leaves, 1-3 leaves per dose for them.

I'm sure some people can sleep on kratom, but I cannot. I'm more of a stoner, never an opiate user (other than kratom) so that might have something to do with it's effect on me.

Kava is more of a downer. I usually drink Kava on days off, and nutmeg breaks.

547^ShamansHawk1111^chocolate^Here is one thread on the essential oil posted by 69ron.

You can easily find more threads on Nutmeg essential oil by simply googling "nutmeg essential oil forum" and you'll run into plenty of reading material and experiences.

https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/herbsmxf/nutmeg-oil-a-far-better-psychedelic-than-nutmeg-nu-t3619726.html

But the way 69ron doses his oil in capsules is just weird to me..

Here's an easier way to dose the oil. I get a cookie. Any cookie. Like chips ahoy or something. I measure 1ml (don't over do it!!) by using my measuring spoons. Using the 1/4 teaspoon (one quarter teaspoon), I fill that spoon flat with nutmeg essential oil (using a dropper that comes with the oil) and dump it onto the cookie. The cookie is necessary because the oil soaks into the cookie surface and will not be lost. Goes down easier on chocolate chip cookies too. 

1ml is enough. 2ml was pretty strong and made me giggly while at work.. which is a bit too much! Was reminding me of my mild acid trips. I don't need to be mildly tripping and giggling at nothing while serving the public! lol 


The effect of the essential oil on 1ml is less stoney and more focused and stimulating than regular nutmeg. The stimulating effect literally gets stronger and stronger over a course of 12 hours, like regular nutmeg. I always have my caffeine with this too, and I seem to be more jittery under the effect of nutmeg essential oil. I generally feel happier on it too, and work harder. I stress that it's pretty stimulating.. So, if you plan to get to sleep at 9pm at night, you need to dose this essential oil around 7am that morning. It may still be pretty stimulating past 9pm that night... It can keep you awake past midnight easy. When I need to sleep, I'd pop a Melatonin and just lay as still as I can to get to sleep. 


I'm sorry that all this is so complicated and long lol It's one thing after another! Please be careful and do lots of reading if you even think about trying any of this stuff. I'm willing to go into more detail on any of this if you want.

548^maxrippley^opiates^Hes not comparing weed to opiates hes comparing trying to quit a substance and being subjected to pictures of the substance all day long. This is a very valid comparison.
Dont be a dick.

548^maxrippley^opiates^Opiates affect people differently, like for me I've always had a hard time going to sleep on them. If I do enough to nod and go to bed before the nod wears off I can, but if I stay up past it, it shard to go to bed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
549^sillyfuckqc^opiate^id love to try BTH, even if its a little less potent it seems like it has a true, nice opiate feeling to it. only stuff i ever got was some brown sugar like stuff with small rocks in it, that tasted like cake when smoked lol... and some purple fent dope which didnt come out on any test... H game is weird in eastern canada

549^sillyfuckqc^opiates^haha here in east canada opiates are pretty costy... but pharmas arent its weird lol only the patches are costier

550^Triune333^china^I didn‚Äôt expect juul to be so good. I tried it once for a few hits on New Years and it looks big and ugly. When I bought it I was surprise by how tiny they are, smaller or thinner than puff bars or at least feel better. I like the party light feature. And now you‚Äôre saying the juul flavors are the best makes me happier. I hope menthol is as good as the mint if the mint is good. Most people told me they don‚Äôt like tobacco flavors but I was using a tobacco one for my smok novo so I think I‚Äôll like it, I bet it‚Äôs better than the naked American patriot one I have.

I also got a rustic looking American flag skin that looks cool coming in that I‚Äôm excited about. It was actually seeing the American flag skin and how slim the juul looked in a video that made me buy it. Glad I did!

Only thing that scares me is my friend told me juul are so bad for you, that he started having sounds in his lungs, hopefully he‚Äôs just tripping.

Oh an I also like that it‚Äôs not like puff bars where the battery often dies before the juice is finished.

And I don‚Äôt know much about the difference between China quality and American but the description on juuls site and the fact that it‚Äôs American does make me happy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
551^throwawaynodaway^opiates^I second Kratom. I was skeptical that something you can get so easily would help with withdrawals that everyone talks about when going off opiates. I was scared shitless so I never lasted a full 24 hours, I hate being sick 
After a daily use for over a year I ordered Kratom and decided I have to change my life before its too late.
I took my last pill at night, dosed Kratom when I woke up and would take small bits throughout the day. Next day, next day. Didn‚Äôt feel a single withdrawal symptom at all, and I still got 5-6 hours of sleep

60mg methadone 1mg klonapin 600x gabapentin 3x daily + weed pyrazolam methylclonzepam as maintenance clonzolam for very hard insomnia times or extreme panic that won‚Äôt rest with the mentioned meds

I know i sound like some noob who thinks ive got it all figured out but PAWS is always what drew me back to dope after having a month or two clean.  If you are on a sticky opioid like subs or methadone then the paws is a real problem and thats why they recommend being at least 90 days off of those and switch to a SAO until you can get the ibogaine.  In any event when you leave you get boosters if any paws symptoms develop... again not tryin to argue or sound like i know it all cause i sure as shit dont im just tryin to spread the good word of Iboga...thanks for the encouragement too bro!

555^alacomba^black^Not exactly the answer to your question but one night after going to a party, i was stumbling in to my house at around 4 am. 

I have this one really close friend who has been through some shit and doesn‚Äôt have a dad and his mom is unreliable, so he‚Äôs been couch surfing and it‚Äôs not unusual for him to randomly pop up at my house unannounced when he needs a place to stay, and my mom and me have always been very understanding as we‚Äôve been friends since we were 5. 

As I‚Äôm making my way upstairs and to my room, i notice my bedroom light is on from the crack of my door, i think ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs odd, I‚Äôm sure i turned it off when i left‚Äù. I make it to my room, and i open door, still a little dazed, and see my best friend laying in my bed naked, with his dick in his hand, playing porn on my flatscreen throughly my Xbox one. Creative i must say.

Although anyone would see this is and immediately turn away and leave the room, my drink ass didn‚Äôt put two and two together for about 10 seconds as i said ‚Äúoh hey what‚Äôs up bro‚Äù, and stood there as he frantically gathered the blankets to cover himself. 

I see him do this, look over at the TV and see a giant black dude railing this little white girl, look back at him, see he has no pants on, and then realize my best friend let himself be not my house, got himself comfortable in my bed, hopped on my Xbox, popped on some youporn and started wanking it on my sheets. And then i walked in on it.

I wasn‚Äôt mad, i was just in utter disbelief of the situation, and me being wasted made it a billion times funnier.

I just fell to the ground and started wheezing, as he sat there unsure what to do with himself, as i just caught him in a very compromising position. 

After catching my breath, i told him it‚Äôs alright, now we are just closer friends if anything, and that he needs to clean my sheets the next morning.

I let him have the bed that night.

556^DropdeadFred18^opiates^It‚Äôs the addicts who are robbing small businesses, robbing random people and family, the ones who act a fool and look the part. I get why people are so salty about those types of addicts! But like anything the bad outweighs the good!!!
I‚Äôm in the same shoes as you but my addiction was opiates. Held a full time job, paid for everything, family and friends had no idea that I was putting hundreds of dollars a week up my nose for 6+ years until I decided to check myself into detox/treatment. Once I told them I was treated like a child and definitely felt the judgment. From assholes who‚Äôd call me before ANYONE ELSE for help or to talk! Never been arrested, no felonies, never brought drugs around them ect. But hey being a alcoholic is cool and understandable because it is legal and adults have it hard. Lmao

556^DropdeadFred18^opiates^Idk if you‚Äôre trolling or not. But you should honestly just stay the fuck away from opiates dog. Trip or eat 500mg of some cheeba chews I promise you that you won‚Äôt second guess anything

556^DropdeadFred18^opiate^Someone will say you‚Äôre being rude but fuck em. You‚Äôre straight up honest! Sounds like they shouldn‚Äôt be tooting any opiate if they aren‚Äôt familiar with od symptoms or how the high works. Op she‚Äôs just being cautious for ya

556^DropdeadFred18^opiate^Yeah dude but play it SMART! Opiate addiction sucks dick but benzos is a whole different level! Only benzos & booze withdrawals can kill a player

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
557^XannyMandingo^gum^Yes 100%. I can be juul free without adderall for very long, but the moment i take one I crave badly. Nicotine gum helps alittle but it is nothing compared to an inhaled nicotine rush.

557^XannyMandingo^dreams^I have dreams that are often so similar to reality of me doing stupid shit that I have to verify I was dreaming when I wake up

557^XannyMandingo^dreams^Interesting, my dreams feel fairly short (1-2 hours maybe?) but I have multiple per night. I can still kind of remember one of them; it was the awkward one where nothing was really happening I was eating pizza but I ran out so I had to go downstairs to get more pizza from this random little kids birthday party (weird ik) but I had to sneak it because I wasnt invited so I was basically walking around trying to act casual. I was scoping out the pizza but the parents were watching me like a hawk so it was awkward af

557^XannyMandingo^dreams^From my experience over the last couple nights my dreams were normally positive; at worst, awkward. Are you saying this dream state continues indefinitely?

Edit - your dream sounds terrifying. I normally never have nightmares, but I do get the occasional sleep paralysis which scares the shit out of me.

557^XannyMandingo^black^Doesnt hurt much, but I got shot 15 times in the stomach once and I had a bunch of black dots where I got shot for like a year after lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
558^osnapitzchandler^opiate^the strips are a pain in the a$$.   
plus the strips are suboxone (Buprenorphine 2/4/8 or 12mg and Opiate antagonist Naloxone .5/1/2/3 mg) Preventing IV/IM use unless in 2/.5mg strips.   
But yeah , sorry stuck on 120 mgs of addy rn lol.   
Subutex is a life saver for opioid dependency , ime. And is so a great med for depression and ptsd.   
 

In simplified terms, buprenorphine can essentially be thought of as a non-selective, mixed [agonist‚Äìantagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist%E2%80%93antagonist) [opioid receptor modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor_modulator), acting as a [partial agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist) of the MOR (doses at 32mgs or higher), an [antagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) of the KOR , an antagonist of the DOR, and a relatively low-affinity, very weak partial agonist of the ORL-1  


All in all, Buprenorphine potentiates adderalls stimulation and mood lift extremely. Insomnia is a big issue for me w/ these two. thanks for klonopin.  


**Improved mood**: Many people report an immediate improvement in mood upon taking Buprenorphine. It works as a partial agonist (Full agonist if user is opiate naive, or if dose is 100ug-2mg) on the mu-receptor, which has been found to inhibit serotonin, and also act as a releasing agent for serotonin, and dopamine (19x more than serotonin)  ‚Äì both of which are linked to mood improvement, and cognitive euphoria.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
559^dyingoutwest94^black^That‚Äôs what I was thinking too. There are so many of these going around, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard for a drug ring with tons of cash to get all this stuff packaged and legit and now they are filling so many people. Either that or something is going on in France and someone is letting all this oxy get into the black market. I want to just buy an oxy test. If it tests positive for oxy I doubt it has fent in it

559^dyingoutwest94^opiates^I appreciate it. I wasn‚Äôt mad or upset or anything I just was wondering if it was sarcasm or not lol. I never took a pill in my life before I had a script for opiates. I can‚Äôt function without them because of pain. I know it is just the beginning of the month, but it‚Äôs not like I was every crazy about it. Most I‚Äôve ever done in 24 hours is 120mg. Not that it‚Äôs a good thing and saying I don‚Äôt do a lot, because that‚Äôs way too much for one day. But yeah. Let‚Äôs see how I am at the end of the month

559^dyingoutwest94^opiate^From my knowledge with the little research I did on Kratom the other week, it acts on the same opiate receptors but it doesn‚Äôt send off addictive signals to these receptors. I‚Äôm not sure if the exact science but this is just my explanation of it. If you watch Hamilton‚Äôs Pharmocopia they explain it in the Kratom episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
560^PhonieMcRingRing^black^Will South Carolinians do the right thing and vote Graham out? 

I hope they will but then again, a transgender person exists somewhere; that's clearly more important than having a criminal as president, investing in infrastructure, or dealing with the rising tide that gonna fuck over SC's coast line. 

White South Carolinians are some of the most racist, religious antebellum pieces of shit this country has ever produced.  Graham, Dabo Swinney, Mark Sanford, Nikki Haley, Strom Thurmond, the list goes on and on. 

Quote me on that : South Carolina is by far the shittiest of the Carolinas and it is not even close.  I feel bad for the state's poorest residents, black or white.

560^PhonieMcRingRing^black^Facts? He does not need FACTS! He has FEELINGS!!!

(Disregard the fact that NPR's biggest contributors include the Walton Foundation (you know, from Walmart? The biggest pusher of leftist beliefs ever created in America!) 

It's because they don't push out-rage porn as news; NPR needs to stop reporting on reality and start reporting on my feelings!

For example of what he is looking for : a Trans person exists!! Black people are uddity! Democrats are the real racists!! 

Stupid shit that conforms to his small minded view of the world

560^PhonieMcRingRing^opiates^To add on to this, knowing that type of drug test they are gonna give you in advance can dictate what drugs you can do.

5 panels are most common and the most limited of the dip pee tests. They test for 5 drugs: cannabis, cocaine, OPIATES, METH/amphetamine, and PCP/Benzos (Newer tests have Benzos instead of PCP, which makes sense since benzo abuse is much more common than PCP)

Why did I capitalize Opiates and Meth?  Because you can get away with taking OPIODS and different Amphetamines (ie MDMA) and pass these tests without a problem. For example, you can roll your balls off (if you know for a fact that it's pure MDMA or at least not cut with meth), take oxy and xanax (if it's 5 panel testing for PCP) to come down and piss fine on a five panel.  Basically what I am saying is that 5 panel test is a joke.

For a 15 panel, best bet its to drink alot of water the day before and day of test, take something to make sure pee yellow so it passes the eye test, and, if you can, try to collect the "middle" of your stream since the first and last spurts of urine tend to be the most concentrated.

Lab test? Drink water, take come cretatin, and pray.

560^PhonieMcRingRing^black^I find his religiousness to be odious and smug at best and down right dangerous when he references it in regards to his team's success and his support of the president.  Why does Jesus love him more than his opponent?  He's a fundamental Christian nutjob who uses his "virtuous religion image" to sweep the shit things he and others have said and done under the rug.  

He does not believe student athletics should be [paid](https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-10-04/clemson-dabo-swinney-ncaa-paying-players); college athletics, especially D-1 football, is rooted in plantation ideology, thought, and exploitation, something the creator of the term and subsequent policies of "Student-Athlete"  admitted once he retired from the NCAA.  

He said that the  people protesting the murder of black people by police officers should "go back to their own [countries](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/16/clemson-coach-faces-criticism-over-comments-about-athlete-protests)

Dabo maybe good at coaching football but he's a shithead everywhere else in his life; a selfish, self-centered piece of garbage.

edit: A nice summary of some of the shit stuff Dabo has done. [Link](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yp87gy/all-the-stupid-shit-dabo-swinney-has-said-ranked)

561^klonopin-condor^black^Maybe he‚Äôll just black out and go to work anyway. I did on 7 but he did 8 lmao

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
562^liam_neesons_penis^opiate^It‚Äôs just, this is a super dangerous time to be an opiate addict. Not like the good ol days. I wish you luck.

562^liam_neesons_penis^opiate^Hey, word of advice: you don‚Äôt want to stop...so don‚Äôt stop. If you‚Äôre out cruising for some dick keep your opiate shit personal. 
When you take on this lifestyle you have to remain clandestine it‚Äôs not an option. It all comes down to what you are willing to do to maintain regular usage.

562^liam_neesons_penis^opiates^Opiates are not a good solution for mental health problems. But, I‚Äôm not telling you anything that you don‚Äôt already know.
I‚Äôve been there too man: when you just feel like throwing in the towel.

562^liam_neesons_penis^dreams^Yeah, the nightmares suck. I get them most nights on subs. Heroin completely stops my dreams all together (or I can‚Äôt remember them).

562^liam_neesons_penis^opiates^You are in a position where that is too large of a drop on that medication. You might as well be leaping off a cliff.
Tapering off opiates doesn‚Äôt mean suffering. Nobody has to suffer...doctors are not always the best and patients lie.

562^liam_neesons_penis^opiates^No, definitely not. As long as it‚Äôs not contaminated opiates last forever. Obviously, the potency declines over time. However, they still work. Even heat doesn‚Äôt do much...boiling point is what ruins a lot of opiates...it can turn morphine into pseudo-morphine which has no euphoria.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
563^St_agustine^china^How could anybody answer this question? 
     There are definitely chemists that make chemicals for $$.   That‚Äôs what they do right?   
       I feel like if I were going to invest that kind of $, I‚Äôd spend a little extra and actually visit China ( or wherever) and meet somebody in person and see there lab.   Is that not possible? Idk.  Seems reasonable to me.

563^St_agustine^opioid^The state of affairs is so fucked up with the opioid rc scene I feel like if I tried a sample of these new chems, I‚Äôd post that they are all garbage, just to help keep it all for myself and discourage others from ordering.... 
      The minute ppl start saying how amazing something is, everyone and their mother starts ordering.  Vendors sell out and raise prices to make it unaffordable,   Newbs OD.   Substance gets banned.  
     The days of dope fiends helping other fiends is over.  No room for love and kindness in the opioid game.   I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but I keep seeing reviews stating it‚Äôs all garbage, then  another post saying it‚Äôs good.     Hard to know if vendors trying to make $$ or users trying to drive price down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
564^nohopewhytry^opiate^I have been opiate free since July 3 2019 because of methadone and my life has gotten so much better

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
565^PCJ69^opiates^I love benzo's and opiates. In my experience benzo's can fuck your life up just as badly if not worse. They lower your inhibitions to the point where you would do things without giving a fuck about the consequences at all. Especially when blacked out.

565^PCJ69^opiates^I don't know why, but Opiates don't seem to have any effect on my bowels. Maybe because of my IBS.

565^PCJ69^opiates^I love opiates. They're my favourite class of drugs, but for some reason they make me extremely irritable. Like when someone drops a cup, or burps for example it pisses me off so much. 

Opioids do numb my emotions, but I just can't figure out why they make me so much more irritable than usual.

I'm asking you because I've made so many posts about this, but no one has answered my question as yet, and you're the only one on the post so far that seems to have extensive knowledge and some experience with opiates.

565^PCJ69^opiate^I just prefer the word "opiate" to "opioid" because I'm a lazy fuck and I don't want to enunciate the "oi".

565^PCJ69^opioid^But wouldn't opiates/opioids have to act on opioid receptors to be considered so, regardless or their chemical similarities? I'm not sure if DXM acts on these receptors.

565^PCJ69^opiate^I occasionally dream of doing heroin, but the only opiate I've ever gotten high off of was codeine.

565^PCJ69^opiates^Lol I don't do codeine because it's cool. I do it to self medicate when I'm in pain or depressed, otherwise I take it recreationally.

 I've been getting high off of it since I was 12, and even then I never took it because of some dumb trend or to look cool. I never even knew people commonly abused it then. 

People who do drugs because they think that it's "cool" are making a huge and easily preventable mistake. Especially when it comes to opiates in regard to it's addiction potential. 

I'm being hypocritical because abusing drugs recreationally is also stupid. Yet people who smoke or drink alcohol don't get criticised almost nearly as much as elicit drug users.

565^PCJ69^opiate^You have 30mg pills. I've been getting high off of codeine since I was 12 and it only takes 20mg after a week long tolerance break on an empty stomach for me to get a light nod.

I'd say take 4 or 5 if it's your first time doing codeine since you might not realize you're high as you aren't familiar with the feeling, and it's a fairly weak opiate.

565^PCJ69^opiates^Yeah, I know benzos and opiates are a dangerous combo, but I would've definitely OD'd with that much codeine on it's own. I wouldn't have taken that dose if I didn't black out on the benzo's.

565^PCJ69^opiates^90 pounds? That's fucking ridiculous. I'm South African, and there's a brand that costs around 1 pound per bottle. We don't even need a prescription for codeine, it's OTC.

It's probably because "lean" is nowhere nearly as praised here as it is in the US or the UK. We do have a problem with opiates, and lean is fairly popular amongst teenagers, but it's not an epidemic. 

I really fucking hope codeine doesn't become prescription-only here. Withdrawals will fucking kill me along with my chronic pain.

565^PCJ69^opiates^I took zopiclone because I was extremely depressed. I blacked out and I was meant to take 300mg because my back was fucking killing me and I had a cluster headache.

I knew that a regular dose wouldn't relieve the pain because I have a high codeine tolerance.
I lost my inhibitions on the zopiclone and I took double the dose instead.

I went to my room and I immediately knew that I took too much. I layed on my bed and tried to stay awake while forcing my self to breathe at the same time.

I felt better after a few minutes after I threw up. I never would have done this if I were sober. I know how deadly CNS depressants and opiates are.

I feel much better now, I just feel like puking every now and then. The codeine atleast managed to get rid of the headache and backache. Feel like it never happened. 

After this experience I definitely won't do this shit again.

565^PCJ69^opioid^Tramadol can get you high. Not all people can get high from it as different people process it differently. 

Tramadol is a fairly weak opioid, and is about the same strength as codeine. Prolonged use could cause serotonin syndrome. This can also happen if you combine it with SSRI's.

I personally prefer codeine. I can't get high off tramadol at all. 

You should not exceed 400mg per day, as there is a seizure risk above that dose. I don't know how it will feel compared to oxy as I've never taken oxy before, nor have I gotten high off of trams. It's only ever potentiated codeine for me.

565^PCJ69^opiates^I asked a similar quesrion a few days ago. Most people commented that they both feel pretty much the same. Both codeine and heroin are metabolised into morphine. 

I think that one thing that definitely can't be compared between the two is the rush. Heroin is converted into 6-MAM, giving the user an intense rush that can't be compared to many other opiates. 

Other than that, I think that the feeling, such as the emotional numbing, warmth and the type of euphoria that you get would feel the same at some point during both highs.

565^PCJ69^opium^Oh fuck, you guys need a script for codeine? That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. I wouldn't be surprised if people move to dope to treat chronic pain just because they can't get OTC codeine. 

How about poppies? What if you grow them and extract the opium or make poppy seed tea? I think it's legal to grow a certain amount of opium poppies, but it's illegal to extract the opium. I don't see how you would get caught if you grow it in your own garden, where no one else can see.
It's extremely addictive though.

565^PCJ69^opiates^Idk how the fuck anyone would be able to workout on opiates. When I'm on them I couldn't give a fuck about anything besides laying down and enjoying my high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^My fianc√© doesn‚Äôt believe in medication. She‚Äôs flushed multiple scripts before. 

I actually need the pills (why else would my doctor put me on this dose?) 

I have a past of abusing pills, opiates, benzos, stims, you name it I‚Äôve done it. But that‚Äôs my past. I was able to overcome my addictions, but my doctor saw that I needed these particular meds. But my girl just think I‚Äôm trying to get high. 

I literally suffer mentally without my medication, I don‚Äôt get high I get relief. 

But she doesn‚Äôt see that and dictates how much I should take and when I should take it.

It‚Äôs a fucked up situation.

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^Oh I can fuck on opiates and last it just doesn‚Äôt entice me at all. Like I literally don‚Äôt see any fun in sex I just want to nod LMAO

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiate^My first opiate I ever tried. Found a 120 count bottle of these in my kitchen cabinet back when I lived with my parents. It was my moms script but she barely used them. 

I was opiate naive and didn‚Äôt know what they were. Bottle said ‚Äúhydrocodone‚Äù and I was like I wonder what this is.

Took 4 and was nodding the fuck out.

Started stealing more and more after that. 

I felt so shitty for that. These are so nostalgic tho

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^Been with her for 6 years and have a child in the way with her. Can‚Äôt just yo and leave I gave up heroin and opiates for her. 

These meds I actually need though.

Like I said earlier it‚Äôs a fucked situation

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^That was a while ago. Maybe a year. After I got kicked out (which was the 5th time) I got deeper into opiates until I found out my girl was pregnant. I dropped all drugs except my medication and have rekindled my relationship with my parents. Life is good now.

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiate^Idk I‚Äôve heard gabapentin is a cure for opiate withdrawal as well as many other things. 

I personally get it for my RLS and it can sometimes help for my anxiety but it works for different things

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^Tbh after I started benzos I experienced the same but opiates made me just say fuck sex. I have zero sex drive after opiates. 

Just don‚Äôt take benz before sex lmao. Sex is best without pills tbh

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiate^Damn, I guess to each they own, I‚Äôd take hydro over Xanax any day. I literally declined a Xanax prescription. 

I guess it‚Äôs a good thing you‚Äôre not walking down the opiate road tho

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^Damn. I had no idea there was even a market for klonopin. Doesn‚Äôt seem they‚Äôre very expensive though. I‚Äôd trade my 90 kpins for some opiates any day

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiate^My first opiate I ever tried were the Watson 7.5mg hydrocodones. Had no idea what hey were, found in a drawer in my parents kitchen. Tried 3 and fell in love.

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^opiates^I‚Äôm actually prescribed 3mg a day and usually only take three, but like I said before, I‚Äôve been able to function on 8mg before. I never said I do that all the time keep in mind. 

But yes I do have a massive tolerance which is why sometimes I‚Äôll take more than my prescribed 3mg if I‚Äôm having a really shitty day, hence this post. 

I don‚Äôt act stupid on benzos either like most do. They take away all the stress in my life and relax me, which is what they‚Äôre supposed to do right? Kids these days love to get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and pop bars and do stupid shit so I understand your assumption but believe me, I have a massive drug history(basically tried everything in the book except psychedelics) and definitely know how to handle my drugs without acting a fool.

Again, I don‚Äôt use benzos to get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù either. Back in the day I used to which is why I have such a high tolerance to them, but Opiates are my DOC. 

I use klonopin to function.

568^oxycaughtyouslippinn^black^Where are you getting that I do ‚Äúbig amounts of drugs‚Äù? I have a high tolerance dude. I don‚Äôt black out on half a bar like you probably do. 

I never said it barely affects me either, I said I‚Äôm able to function.

What do you have against me dude?

Trying to build my life back together. If u want unsolicited advice from me it‚Äôs fuck your plug and stop opiates immediately

571^BigSam6699^black^13 Assassins is Fire. I just watched the Black Society Trilogy and it‚Äôs also great.

571^BigSam6699^black^Are a lot of black people who started on lean switching to dope because pharma lean is so expensive/hard to find? I haven‚Äôt observed this , but it would make sense to me

571^BigSam6699^opium^Wow I‚Äôve never heard of Fent in opium, but it‚Äôs hard to find opium in North America and they‚Äôve really only cutting w Fent here so it‚Äôs possible. What I would is smoke w tiny bit first to give u a feel. Then make tea with half a gram, drink a tiny bit like 10% and wait a few hours to see how u feel

571^BigSam6699^china^U tell EM‚Äô Kicker. Nobody is getting SEA China white on the east coast (unless their name is BigSam6699). Agree it sounds like straight Fent, some of the Colombian #4 dope is pretty white too, but that‚Äôs not what this sounds like

571^BigSam6699^opiate^Right same here, I assumed u were opiate naive for some reason. Good thing those pills don‚Äôt have Tylenol. I used to chew them up, but think oral is the way to go

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
572^FuckGrandpaJ0e^black^I have black octane rlcs tactician as well and I‚Äôm really tryna figure out what I can get for this. Do you have any idea?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
573^soldierchrome^black^Haha I think they look great and make the pants stand out. It makes the outfit look more cool whereas black shoes would‚Äôve looked a bit basic, just my $.02 hahah

573^soldierchrome^black^I thought you meant that white is too flashy so I said black coz it‚Äôs a staple.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
574^bad_momo^black^Thanks! I'm really glad I just did it, and you're totally right. I was already doing black and white, idk why I let it scare me so much haha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
575^yoon53^black^i once passed off being black out drunk as "food poisoning"

mum walked in on me passed out and covered in vomit and took me to the shower and helped me shower cause i could barely stand lol, in the morning it became apparent i'd somehow convinced them i had food poisoning from food class at school and i had to pretend i could remember my mum showering me :")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
576^nynex2^opiates^I‚Äôm still lucky my guys are still stocking that real grown from the earth #4 heroin. I know there‚Äôs no fent because I get tested at the clinic for my subs and I never get a hit for any opiates except diamorphine.

So yeah it‚Äôs out there but you‚Äôre more than likely going to stumble on some fent first. But if you‚Äôre living in an area with a small scene then you‚Äôre right there may not be any real dope coming in at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
577^yeenspace^opioid^This is semantics man. Its werid. English is werid. But i agree i don't like it. Im a recovering drug addict. I wont ever say i was MEDICATED its bullshit. An excuse to USE or look better for using specific drugs you are using away from scripts. So many dealers, n stubstance users i know say this shit. I cringe every time. Its just people excusing there issues half the time. Thankfully weed not a BAD thing. But when you get into other much MUCH more illicit drugs you see this used more so ie. Herion, fentanyl, other opioid drugs, methamphetamines, coke n many other lesser or verying drugs. You see like a TON of people saying medicated. Its like mah nah bro your an Addict. Own up to it. N simply dont play it off as something lesser then it is. Ive seen this alot. I truely DISPISE it. I worked in an addictions help center for almost two years i just resigned reccently, as well as MY reccent struggles to addiction resurfacing (due to my job there...joys...ugh) but i saw this alot. I truely hate it. But its english. N people use it fuildly. Semetics PISS me off when it comes to shit like this. Cuz people just not owning up to there shit. 

All i wish. Is people would just own up to whats going on n not play stuff off as lesser. But psh. When is that Ever Ever gonna happen right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
578^c0mm0nSenseplz^opiates^So glad I don't fuck with opiates anymore, cannot believe I spent so many years in a nod. Be Careful to the people that fuck with that shit and if anybody is struggling here and needs to talk DM me. I help people get off that shit for a living today.

RIP Fredo

578^c0mm0nSenseplz^opiate^Don't start using Dope again, find a different doctor or something. Do the next right thing. Using heroin is probably not it. Going to a doctor or the hospital and explaining the situation you are in is a better idea. Life happens, we gotta accept the consequences. You are not the only one with an opiate problem. 

Suboxone withdrawal lasts a long time, if you cover it with dope you are going to be left with a dope habit. How many times have you tapered of Herion?

Just trying to be real

579^xanaxboi_420^opiates^Yea basically 100 x 40mg Oxycodone. But I also got a script of 50 x 80mg Oxy. 
Your government is just insane, compared at how it all started a few years back man. And now you get treated like a fucking piece of shit. 
People literally dying because they even created a much much worse Blackmarket. I can‚Äôt fucking rant enough about that. 
All we wanna do is poppin some Opiates and we (you, because fuckn USA) have to take the risk of going to prison or six feet under.

579^xanaxboi_420^black^Ah makes sense. I‚Äôve got those orange once with the Black OX 40 Written on them. I mean you can still crush them and snort em up ? At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing rn :D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
580^Al_Con_Queso^opiate^Well, since this is an Opiate Recovery page, to me, clean means off any opiates.. partial antagonist or full, doesn‚Äôt matter. After I was a heroin addict I spent YEARS hooked on Subutex, and just because I could function and go to work and didn‚Äôt have to steal to get my fix, doesn‚Äôt mean I wasn‚Äôt addicted to an opiate... It doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt have scraped, scrounged, and done whatever it took if my supply was cut off. 

For me, when I‚Äôm physically addicted to something that‚Äôs going in my body to the point of ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt take this ____ I will go through withdrawals‚Äù sorry but that counts in my book. Otherwise I‚Äôm just fooling myself into thinking I‚Äôve got it ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù - and that‚Äôs just ridiculous. 

I know plenty of people are thriving on replacement opiates like subs or methadone, and if that‚Äôs working for them, awesome! 

But for me, I am allergic to ANY opiate... if I take them I break out in excuses, rationalizations, and drug seeking behavior... sometimes I break out in handcuffs... 

When I get tired of smoking weed, I stop. When I get tired of alcohol, I don‚Äôt drink. I never was able to get addicted to nicotine... it‚Äôs just those fucking opiates that make my life unmanageable. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.

581^EndlesslyDrowsy^opiates^Yeah am 50/50 on going to a psychiatrist if i go i gotta be 100% committed i can't half ass it. I don't want to waste my time or the psychiatrist time so yeah. OTC Lexapro, Seroquel, Tramadol, Pregabalin, Gabapentin, luckily i have a generous pharmacist that helps me acquire benzos & opiates. Soma is OTC but it's mixed with other medicines. The pharmacist gets me 100% Soma 350mg. I also go to a "Doctor" wink wink once a month he prescribes anything i want as long as the medicine only has 30 or less tablets.

581^EndlesslyDrowsy^opiate^Your good man i regularly take 900mgs with a benzo or opiate or muscle relaxer.  It's just my personal experiences with Pregabalin. You won't overdose if that's what your worried about.

581^EndlesslyDrowsy^opiate^ Try pregabalin with a opiate. Or my 2nd go to combo carisoprodol (Soma) with opiate.

581^EndlesslyDrowsy^opiate^Pregabalin is the shit. I fucking love it but yeah tolerance is a bitch. I shift from 900mg to 2000mg plus lol. You ever stack a benzo or opiate on top of it? I still fell the 3 trams i toke 7 hours ago bro. The fucking nods broüò™. My fucking neighbor has decided to cut his fucking while am half asleep. Am typing this shit with one eye open and the other one closed. Am looking like popeye lol sorry ranting hahaha.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opioid^you may have already been activating opioid receptors too much on a daily basis as an alcoholic (the addictive pleasure of alcohol is apparently caused by the indirect downstream mu receptor activation).  anyway, that's the eventual fate of everyone in this game.  i have decided to get out after massive doses of iv fent no longer gets me high, just sleepy and withdrawal relief.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opiate^cough syrup is supremely abusable.  i used to chug that stuff.  an opiate is an opiate is an opiate.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opioid^yet another physician (in pain management at that!) who is ignorant of opioid pharmacology, or perhaps he's aware and just shitting his pants from the DEA breathing down his neck and is okay with throwing patients under the bus to save his own skin.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opioid^sublocade -- pro: maintenance on an opioid helps mood if you're depressed or anxious
con: still dependent on opioids, possible feeling of highness/withdrawal at beginning and end of dose, respectively
vivitrol -- pro: no longer dependent on opioids
con: possible blockade of endogenous opioids, overdose risk after missing a dose

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opiates^Oh boy.  You sound just like me.  I was so miserable and opiates fixed things.  It became an all-consuming passion -- keeping my supply steady, and finding new sources.  It's like falling in love, you only think about this one thing.

You can do it, and honestly, you may get a good couple of years, but ultimately, you'll be no better off in terms of mental health, and almost certainly other aspects of your life will suffer.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opioid^unfortunately, meth (and other stimulant) addiction is harder to treat than opioid addiction, cause there's no obvious way to satisfy the craving without triggering a high.  i think things extended release ritalin have been tried with some success, but nowhere close to as successful as methadone or bupe for opioid addiction.

there's a special place in hell for people who profit off of the suffering of others with bogus treatments.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opioid^years of opioid addiction has given me a notably flabbier and rounder physique than that guy, and i doubt i need to worry about having a girlfriend, let alone a nosy, blonde girlfriend anytime soon

any junkies here actually stay in shape?  hell, if i'm already destroying my body with junk, staying in shape is just not a priority.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opioid^just to be clear, if you don't have some tolerance, you have no business messing with fent.  even with substantial tolerance to other opioids, 150 ug of iv fent felt very strong at first.  for comparison, a dose that an opioid naive person would receive at, say, a colonoscopy, would be like 25 ug.

583^CrystalFieldTheorist^opiates^happy birthday!  anyway, after nearly a lifetime of being taught to delay gratification, opiates allowed me to do the exact opposite -- instant gratification in a needle.  unfortunately, i feel like it's over -- i go through a week or more of brutal withdrawals for a day or two of pleasure.  it's just not worth it.

i have tried pyschodelics -- as a phd student i was with an organic friend from the lab next door, and he had taken full advantage of his lab's supplies so to speak to make a gram of psilocybin.  i must have done way too much 'cause it was terrifying (though very illuminating and revealing of my long term fears).  i've tried one of every major class of drugs, and they were all worthwhile experiences, but only opioids made me feel like this is how i always wanted to feel.  alas, it does not last!

586^kilgoresparrot^black^You should! I'm still not quite as invested as I was with The Magicians, but I had read the first book already and then had 3 seasons to start off with. I think The Order has a lot of potential, and I hope they see it through.  
I have been waiting to watch the next seasons of both Black Spot and Dark for soooo long now. But I can't watch them without my partner, and for whatever reason whenever it comes up, one of us isn't feeling it. But we straight up had pages of diagrams and theories for Dark when we left off. Really looking forward to it.

589^kolbaserchki^black^Acid completely fucks my body. All kinds of pain. One of my few bad trips I felt literally like a cockroach being sprayed with raid and my whole body was super painful and tense and just felt horrible. 

Shrooms make me feel drunk and give an amazing body high better than alcohol. If anything they relieve my back pain. Shrooms to me feel like drunken tripping almost. Last time I was stumbling around with noodle legs and it felt like gravity turned sideways and I was literally hanging on to doorways for support tryna walk around my house as if a black hole was trying to suck me into the sky. And it was so fun and felt amazing. 7g but I think they were weaker than some I've had.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Opium dens seem so cozy lol I agree. I'd love to visit the middle east and India for several reasons but finding a traditional opium den is one of them. Just be warned that right now due to Apollon's exit scam everything is being fucking DDOSed rn and its super hard to load most markets and forums. Yesterday was fine, today I barely managed to send the vendor a message.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Perfect thanks, and I'm in Colorado so I'm very familiar with concentrates so that gives me a good idea. I might buy a gram of regular and a gram of the shireh. 

I wish it was more popular too. I'll never do heroin or fent. I once broke my leg and had two big ass bottles of hydrocodone and oxycodone. Never once did I take more than the prescribed dose, in fact I halved it due to side effects like cold chills. 

Opium contains morphine yes, and codeine, and thebaine which has miniscule effect. But it is much safer than taking pure morphine and way more safe than heroin I'd think. I mean it stands to reason that as something is made more potent it may also be more dangerous. More side effects, stronger high, stronger withdrawals, and therefore easier addiction and overdose. It's ALMOST like weed vs all the synthetic cannabinoids(I am aware that noids are full agonists and thc is only partial whereas morphine is the same both in opium and isolated)

I don't see why modern medicine didn't just stick with opium and morphine instead of developing stronger and more addictive drugs that are worse than opium. I mean opium addicts are typically very functional compared to addicts of its derivatives, even those who smoke 12 grams a day according to this     

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002204267900900209?journalCode=joda

589^kolbaserchki^incense^Yes I heard of red rock incense. This is a reputable seller who advertises to Europe but I asked and they are willing to ship to US. They have Shireh and regular.

589^kolbaserchki^opiates^Yeah I didn't think fent at all but besides itchiness drowsiness and euphoria idk the effects of opiates. He was possibly nodding off but he is very drug naive and he didn't really get when I tried to ask him if he had been. He definitely zoned out and left reality for long periods possibly nodding off and said at times he felt like he was losing himself 

I live in Colorado and smoke legal weed every day. Unfortunately I wasn't with him and he is in an illegal state.

589^kolbaserchki^black^If the black is just substrate, and not something growing, then I, as a noob currently still waiting for my first jars to finish colonizing, think it looks fine.

589^kolbaserchki^opiates^Obviously "Just say no!" Doesn't work, but discouraging someone from future exploration in opiates who has just read about the people here suffering addiction, might actually influence them as does the opposite.

589^kolbaserchki^opiates^If ya wanna get high smoke some weed. Don't move on to harder shit and weed will suit you just fine. If you go and get yourself an addiction to opiates, then yeah, weed may feel like a shitty high. That would be my advice. Opiates and benzos are better off used medicinally and never recreationally.

589^kolbaserchki^opiates^And I was saying how about stay away from opiates in the first place and never have to resort to immodium because it IS worse for you physically than percs, yet its not what will hook you. I have immediate family who moved on to heroin after stealing some of my percs when I broke my leg in high school. God Bless Baltimore.

589^kolbaserchki^opiates^What the fuck goes through people's heads who say shit like this? Like yeah anyone who does this recreationally is a dumbass, but how the fuck are you gonna follow that up with "take a few percs."  When taking a few percs is what eventually leads people to using a shitty horrible substance like loperamide for withdrawal? Moreover he admitted to being a dumbass. Probably a fucking teenager who just wanted to try some lean. 

"What the fuck? You tried an OTC drug to get high because you don't have any connects? We use that for withdrawal here. Go get addicted to REAL opiates and then you can come here and post about using loperamide dangerously and stupidly the RIGHT way!" 

I hope you were kidding when you said take a few percs. If so, downvote and ignore me.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Yeah that sounds like laudanum which is a really old medicine made of opium dissolved in alcohol. Or it could be paregoric, which is camphorated rather than alcohol.  Where tf and when did you find laudanum?  Especially in an original bottle like that? You must be older than me.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Like an opium vape cart? I see those. Or like laudanum? Easy to make. Or do you mean a smokeable form of opium that is thick and syripy but a liquid?

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Thanks! I'm definitely thinking I'll end up using a dab rig for it. Might try hot kniving once just to feel old school. I'm actually reading that codeine can't be smoked and opium has codeine so taking a slightly bigger dose orally works better and much longer than smoking. I'll test both. I'll have it probably late February or early march hopefully. I plan to make a post about it.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Very nice to know! I think you can still buy pods online but they are hard to find. And I've also heard of poppy seed tea but many places are now selling only washed seeds. 

I see you are correct about the different cultivars of poppies actually being all papaver somniferum. None of the other species of poppy except possibly papaver orientale could have been what they were after looking it up. I do know that many opium dealers over centuries have bred poppies that produce higher amounts of active alkaloids in the opium but all papaver somniferum have a good enough amount.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^This is definitely a plan for the future however my space is way too limited currently. I got the idea after doing some lawn work for a woman with poppies. I think they were bread seed poppies not papaver somniferum, yet they still bled latex that tasted like opium is described when smokex and may have had a very very slight effect. She wanted me to cut them down but it was like the last thing she wanted me to finish,  so I scraped them, then the next day collected the latex and took the heads home after cutting them down when I finished. 

This experience made me really wanna try real opium largely for the taste alone. It was delicious in a floral choclatey incensey kinda way.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Yeah see this is what I expected and thank you for confirming it. This falls in line with experience reports on erowid, except for ones that just say a "bowl" is the amount smoked and don't even mention how many bowls they get out of a gram. 


It seems entirely unreasonable that I'd need 2 grams for smoking. I've heard of hotkniving, and I could also try a dab rig I guess. I will probably try both smoking and eating small amounts. They also have a stronger form called shireh which I understand to be filtered opium pipe resin. The vendor has been pretty fast to answer my questions but there may be a slight language barrier it seems.

589^kolbaserchki^opium^Yeah lol, thanks so much! I'll watch that now. I didn't think of trying to find videos or documentaries since I'm very text based but that is probably my best bet. 

I live in Colorado so I already have a dab rig, might try that. I've heard of them for heroin but wasm't sure if opium would leave behind more residue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
590^dirtydruggiealt^black^Somebody is selling eightballs or quarters or ounces to these guys with the 10 sacks. Meet that guy.

Craigslist is also a good bet. Black roofing tar and clear sealant are hot items.

I've dealt with this too when I was copping on the street. Someone is out there, you just have to look real hard.

590^dirtydruggiealt^opiates^The first time I smoked meth was the best experience I've had with drugs. Maybe the best experience I've had ever. It felt like my life was exactly what it should be even though I was homeless. Even having a history with opiates I had never felt my inner state go from fucked up and sad to absolutely ideal like it did after my second or third hit.

It's never been quite the same.

590^dirtydruggiealt^opiate^Doesn't feel as warm and safe as a strong opiate though. I've never gotten a sense of complete relief from all my problems from weed. If that's not what you're looking for in a drug, or if weed really does it for you in that way, lucky you.

590^dirtydruggiealt^black^Didn't have a scale. One time I bought a piece of black for $40 that was bigger than I would expect, at least half a gram but cut to complete trash. I was shooting like. 06 at the time to get high. Got as much as I could in the rig, did the shot and woke up a couple hours later. The other time I eyeballed it out of my homies 8ball but wanted to leave enough for him and got the same effect.

Even if I did weigh it out the lethal dose you'll read about is the LD50 which means the dose that will kill over 50% of people. There's still a good chance you'll live if you go over. It's not an exact science.

590^dirtydruggiealt^opiates^There is not a drug strong enough that we should withhold harm reduction in the name of not condoning it. I don't need people on the internet to validate my drug use and tell me it's okay to keep using. None of these kids who are about to start using meth or heroin are going to have second thoughts and stop because you berate and dismiss them.

It's not like we don't know that they destroy people's lives, and the kids who come in here convinced that they aren't going to get addicted to a super addictive drug because of how well they handle weed and alcohol and molly and coke or whatever get to have that belief because they think they're invincible despite all the warnings and how badly it goes for a lot of people. There's nothing you can do to change their mind. That's not what they're here for.

Granted it's sometimes hard to advise people on how to do things safely. If someone wants to know how to inject heroin without suffering health consequences we can tell them how to sanitize and hit a vein so they won't get an infection but we can't tell them how not to get into the depraved, unhealthy lifestyles that a lot of people engage in after that. It's worth noting that for a lot of people basic self-care falls out the window pretty quickly after certain lines are crossed. 

But that's not a reason to scold instead of giving support. Some people think it's not worth teaching any harm reduction because "drugs" are categorically too dangerous to see any shades of gray. One day it's marijuana, the next day you're boofing an entire bottle of codeine syrup and the next day you've got a permanent IV bag that you just drop heroin into all day. Best to avoid it altogether, so we're going to lie about marijuana being super dangerous. 

Again, if people heeded every warning they got it would save lots of lives, but the warning sounds like bullshit so we use drugs anyway we just don't get any actual education on how to do things safely and reduce harm. If someone has a friend who uses meth or opiates or whatever who's life isn't in the shitter you lose your credibility when you say those drugs are too risky and must be avoided at all cost. There are also those who are depressed enough that they don't care, and the ranting is lost on them too.

If all you have to say about someone trying a drug is that they shouldn't do it and they're an idiot for even asking, you're not helping.

590^dirtydruggiealt^opiate^If I used those I'd have to turn down most of the heroin I can get access to. Good idea for Xanax users or anyone else who doesn't want a surprise opiate in their drugs though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
591^CSkarp^opiate^Do you have a history of adhd, Tourette's, physical anxiety, heart issues of any kind? For me it was hard getting it prescribed but originally I found it during opiate withdrawal in detox many years ago. This stuff has so many uses you just have to have a reason (other than to help your drug use lol) to push for a prescription.

591^CSkarp^opiates^I'm actually planning to next month. Trust me, I've tried. It's not something I brag about but it's also good to make some light of the dark side that addiction really is. If we can't do that, we won't make it. I'm an addict for life, I've accepted that. Before stims it was opiates but I've been clean off them for 4 years. See the time frame. One to another.

And that being said, I sleep pretty much every day, I eat, I try and hydrate, vitamins all that I can really to reduce the harm.

591^CSkarp^black^Yeah been doing it for 4 years. Tried all kinds of pipes, sizes, lighters, methods. I still don't get how people can hold lighters to the pipe like smoking a brown or black puddle ain't meth. I think at a guess that bowl was under a point.

594^Phy_Scootman^opioid^How much have you actually looked around? I'd never endorse opioid abuse, but if you're determined, at least get off the Trams

594^Phy_Scootman^opioid^I've been a bit of a forum/message board guy for a long time, the idea of an interactive community where we are all working with a blank slate (any overarching topic aside) interests me, but not so much when enveloped with tons of crap with plenty of stickers, etc. to click that easily replace typing actual words, ala Facebook.

Take that and add the fact that I'm a long time, on and off opioid addict and BAM!

594^Phy_Scootman^opiate^I've never given much thought to posting them anywhere, really, but would be open to it if I knew of a place I thought would be receptive and accessible to whomever might wanna look. Dunno how many folks would be interested, honestly. 

Did show a little bit of one in the background on Opiate Church, recently.  Sort of a spur of the moment thing.

596^fuxwidyahard^opiate^I‚Äôve never understood how lean got so much hype around it. Codeine, literally the shittiest opiate to ever be put on the market, and promethazine, anti-histamine they give you for a tummy ache.

596^fuxwidyahard^opioid^Yes kratom is great, depending on quality, most of the time smoke shops carry some pretty bunk shit but I just recently picked up some very good quality red Borneo from a local smoke shop and it‚Äôs a god send for these wd‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been taking kratom daily for probably 2 years now, I used it to quit my opioid habit I had and just never stopped, but I did switch to some really low quality shit about a year ago just because it was what was available in my immediate area. But now that I‚Äôm going through the benzo withdrawals idk if I could do it without having found this quality kratom. And once you get totally over the benzo wd‚Äôs just cold turkey the kratom, you‚Äôll see people say it‚Äôs hard to stop but it‚Äôs really not man, if you can get off of benzos then putting kratom down cold turkey is a walk in the park, a little runny nose and RLS for like 3 days and then you‚Äôre as good as new. I‚Äôve cold turkey‚Äôd off of 25g a day for months straight of quality kratom and it wasn‚Äôt even close to as bad as the withdrawal you get from a quick benzo taper

596^fuxwidyahard^opiates^Bro you ever tried a benzo? Or hell even a muscle relaxer? Not that I recommend benzos, they‚Äôre the only thing more evil than opiates. But antihistamines are OTC for a reason. They don‚Äôt fuck you up. Promethazine is RX only, but I‚Äôm not really sure why, it‚Äôs no more sedating than doxylamine which is an OTC antihistamine

596^fuxwidyahard^opiate^Well tramadol is an opioid not an opiate. I‚Äôm unfortunately one of those people whose bodies metabolizes opioids very poorly, so I‚Äôve never felt any effects from tramadol even at crazy doses, and the only effects I‚Äôve ever gotten from codeine were hives and extreme itching. I rate both drugs 0/10 well codeine -2/10 cause it literally just gives me an allergic reaction. But still the point remains, lean is dumb. Pop some Percocet with some hydroxyzine and then you‚Äôre on mega lean lol it‚Äôs just a garbage drug that got hyped up through rap. But seriously it seems like atleast one rapper who has tried lean and literally any other opioid would come out and be like ‚Äúyo, lean aint shit, try poppin like 2 percs and see for yourself‚Äù

596^fuxwidyahard^opioid^Do a cold water extraction on your Percocet/hydrocodone if you plan on taking more than 4. The acetaminophen in these pills are actually more toxic than the opioids and if you‚Äôre using Percocet/hydrocodone to get high you‚Äôre much more likely to OD on the acetaminophen than the opioid. I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôve never done this because I‚Äôm reckless and don‚Äôt want to waste any of my drugs since I have a super high tolerance, so I can‚Äôt remember the exact method, but it‚Äôs very simple and you can just google CWE and find your step by step instructions.

Also I don‚Äôt IV but for all those people out there that do. Use a micron filter every time!

596^fuxwidyahard^opioid^Yeah man and I see people recommending people benzos for opioid withdrawal all the time and it‚Äôs just the absolute worst advice. If you got addicted to opioids chances are you‚Äôll get addicted to the benzos you‚Äôre using to kick the dope. You can quit dope through sheer will power, a lot of will power, and it‚Äôs definitely tough, but it‚Äôs nothing like benzo withdrawal, it takes a lot more than will power to kick benzos. Glad you got off the oxy tho man, and I wish you luck in kicking the benzo habit. I‚Äôm currently on a taper using diclazepam because I‚Äôm one of the idiots who got himself an RC benzo addiction, and it‚Äôs fucking tough, I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone but now that you‚Äôre in it just make sure you see your way through to the end man. A life without any substance dependence truly is great, I had it for about a year and it was awesome, then relapsed and I‚Äôm back in shitsville

596^fuxwidyahard^opioid^Do it man! Don‚Äôt expect the kratom to completely nullify your opioid withdrawal because it‚Äôs not going to do that, but it will help a ton, and with the right mindset it will make getting off the opioids 100x easier. I used it for the very same reason, it‚Äôs still going to be hard man, so the most important thing is your mindset and your will to get clean, don‚Äôt expect it to be easy and then say fuck it and get back on the hard stuff. You‚Äôre life is going to be so much better if you get through this man, I hope you‚Äôre able to do it!

596^fuxwidyahard^opiate^I have an insanely high opiate natural tolerance, I could take 200mg of oxy in one go and go to work, or eat dinner with my family and no one could even notice. Turns out there‚Äôs some rare gene in some people with red hair/red facial hair that causes this, however opioids do still ‚Äúwork‚Äù on me, I just need 10x what the average person needs. Maybe there is a similar gene that affects acts the same way but with benzos rather than opioids, and maybe you have it.

596^fuxwidyahard^opiates^Again not recommending it, but if you like promethazine with opiates, literally any benzo with opiates will blow your mind

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
597^BagelKat24^opiate^Junky Jesus did help me get it all haha I love having a good selection, so what we got here


Around the outside

A bunch of 12mcg/h and 25mcg/h fent patches on the left 

One of each 5mcg/h and 10mcg/h Buprenorphine  patch, 

Four 8mg Suboxone (buprenorphine)

A bag of 100mg and 300mg gabapentin not an opi, they are for potentiating my doses


In the top part

3 15mg/mL liquid IV/IM/SC Morphine solution 

100+  1mg Dilaudids 

3 2mg dilly (orange pills)

In the little container with the green lid 5 more 2mg dilly and a 2mg clonazepam emergency container lol

The 2 white pills are 8mg Dillys üíñ


In the container not all are counted, from top to bottom and left to right

37.5mg/325mg tramadol/APAP Ultracet

10x 100mg Tramadol ER

Next 2 slots are Baclofen a Muscle relaxer that has good synergy at low doses and I find it helps me sleep 

Next row 

2mg Loperamide (imodium) I believe it potentates opiates, but I know it synergizes with alot and when taken in a higher dose with codeine can get you pretty high

In the same compartment, 3x .25mg Xanax  and 3x 15mg tampazepam, I will assume you know how benzos work with opiates 

10x 5mg Percs 

The pink ones are all the same 25mg Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, potentiates opiates, good for getting rid of the itches, when taken an hour or more before your dose ot can help get you alot high imo and depending on the opiate.

Orange pills in the bottom are .5mg clonazepam another benzo

And a point of coke in the green baggie for a rainy day lol

‚úå‚úå

597^BagelKat24^opiates^I have heard of people baking oxys in the oven at low temps until its like a light sandy brown color and that is one method to making extended release into instant release.

Also I have heard of people putting crushed up oxys in coke/pepsi over night and it makes it instant release and they just drink it and get a good buzz.

I also feel like if you working try and make it a Freebase kind of like what they do with crack that might work too, but instead of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) i believe you are supposed to use just sodium carbonate with opiates, I assume doing something like that would get rid of the extended release.

597^BagelKat24^opiates^I'm sorry if I didn't get a chance to reply to you on my other post yet but all of that support was so amazing and I was really fucked up last night been sleeping most of today but I had to say thank you this is a wonderful community we need a world of wonderful people like this.

If you want to know what anything is just ask away :) I know I got a couple non opiates.
Tonight I got another free point of Coke and traded buddy in need a 25mcg patch and threw is some clonazepam for 2 more 8mg dillys they were soooo damn good never had em before and damn I was wrecked last nightü§§

597^BagelKat24^opiates^With no tolerance to opiates at do not sniff more than a bump the size of a match head if ot could be fent then you could still OD.

So real oxycodone works really good if you eat it 90% bioavailability meaning if you take half a 30 your body would absorb most of the 15mg which if it is oxycodone will get you high (or should) if you sniff it the Bioavailability is like 60% so you should get higher eating real oxycodone. 

Fentanyl when eaten is 10% Bioavailability but Fentanyl when sniffed is 85+% Bioavailability. So from what I've heard buddy was buying presses with 1.2mg of fent, 10% of .6 is .06mg which can get you sort of high I assume because you have no tolerance but sniffed at 85% of .6mg is like .5mg absorbed and you will OD and probably die especially without alot of immediate narcans.

597^BagelKat24^opiates^Damn eh yea it takes alot of research sometimes  but that voltaren stuff should be good for aches while you're feeling sick.

Its real name is loperamide, Immodium is the brand name and is actually sold as diarrhea medication, it is a derivative of demerol I believe. It does bind to your brains opiates receptors but so slightly that you can't get high off it, it will make you sleepy and it definitely help if you are experiencing withdrawals but it can also help if you are legitimately sick too lol

597^BagelKat24^opioid^You sound like you're sick but it could be a little WDs too, they will make eachother worse. My advice is to get loperamide (imodium) because it is a opioid derivative take like 4mg+ to start, and benadryl (DPH) and lots of apple juice and water because they will make you constipated. Get yourself a night time sleepy tea or a tea that has passion flower in it (passionflower being a natural sedative) 

Hope you feel better‚úå

597^BagelKat24^opium^Papaver somniferum is the only type that produces opium you can only tell by the latin names. Check out r/druggardening

597^BagelKat24^opium^Yes absolutely! They are very different actually, I can't explain it like a professional but I can explain it to the best of my ability (which is pretty good imo) 

Oxycodone is primarily synthesized from Thebaine which is a dissociative type opiate naturally found in opium (like codeine and morphine), this actually gives oxy a more stimulating effect than most other opiods.

Hydromorphone is made from morphine in a similar way to heroin from what I understand, however due to its unique nature it is very fast acting and sedating, hydromorph is actually twice as strong as heroin per mg however it is not nearly as euphoric and very short lasting by comparison.


Oxy is very euphoric, and longer lasting while providing excellent pain relief it is more stimulating than sedating. Hydromorph provides a stronger sedated pain relief that can cause euphoria and in my opinion is better for nodding, and hydromorph has a unique intense rush to it because of its ability to pass the blood brain barrier quicker, so when you inject it or boof it (and even sometimes when sniffing for the first time) it provides an amazing intensely euphoric rush that lasts minutes while you come up on the drug untill it reaches proper levels in your system and then you have a short lasting sedating euphoria afterwards.

Also bioavailability affects how you should take these to get the most out of then individually. If you are interested in learning for about drugs and stuff check out The Drug Classroom on youtube he explains how alot of opiates work and their differences in very easy to understand ways, sometimes it gets a little sciencey but it is normally understandable.

Hope this helps a bit‚úå

597^BagelKat24^opiate^I don't suggest moving to stronger opiates however for safety reasons I would recommend codeine or hydrocodone, if a 300-400mg dose of codeine doesn't get you feeling good you probably have a poor opiate metabolism. Also doses like that of codeine could give you stomach cramps and stuff so be prepared and definitely take a non drowsy ginger based gravol

597^BagelKat24^opiates^What I recommend for most people with tramadol is to use potentiators that way you can take less but stillget a great buzz also I believe Tramadol has a ceiling dose meaning after a certain mg your body can't do anything with it, like for example codeines ceiling is like 400mgs. To get a better buzz you could take 25-75 mgs of Diphenhydramine (benadryl) or 250 - 500mL of pure Grapefruit juice an hour before dosing it will help your liver produce more CYP2D6 which helps the body break down opiods, helping the effect last longer and be stronger over all which means you can take less and still achieve the same high. Perscriptions like Pregabalin or Gabapentin can do wonders in helping potentiate because of the pain relief effects and synergy with opiates. Also I have found Passion flower teas or bed time herbal teas found at the pharmacy (most often) do the for me at night to really get sleep, can make the hour before bed a nod fest and a half.


I just like to wish people caution with Tramadol because of the seizure factor even tho it is a very low probability, I warn more because I leanred that Tramadol is very different from normal opiods and can have alot of different affects on the brain. I like to help people learn there are lots of different tips and tricks we can do to safely enjoy our buzz better and make our product last longerüëç I myself love tramadol as well it has a wonderful euphoria and great affects for me, I deff have the Tramadol Gene haha.

Have fun and stay safe sleepy sibling‚úå

597^BagelKat24^opiate^I boof morphine all the time, 20mg first time will overwhelm you and make you sick especially being opiate naive, I think that even just doing 10mg could overwhelm you. You can always take more but never less and boofing is so much stronger than sniffing or eating it. Here is a link to a guide on boofing and a bioavailability chart. Good luck

597^BagelKat24^opiate^Yo man you got this! You can get clean and kick this shit you know you want to and I think you can, good idea trying to find out info before hand, going to new clinics can be very intimidating. I really hope you get the info you're looking for.

But I think your post is going to get band soon for adding a location, no locations is a rule to keep the sub safe but in a situation like this it is kind of needed so that we can help you better maybe you can try the opiate recovery subreddit they might be able to help too.


No one gets clean over night, if you have a slip dont let it pull you right under again. Do not beat yourself up. People slip up. We are only human and we all struggle but no one deserves to struggle alone, I wish I could be there to help you and if you ever need someone to talk or vent to I'm here I'll do whatever I can because as people we gotta stick together. Remember not to be to hard on yourself, addiction can happen to anyone but you are getting help. Which is more than alot of people can say. üëç

597^BagelKat24^opiate^In Canada we get melatonin over the counter and I was told by multiple sources that it it's quite helpful for opiate insomnia, because melatonin is natural in your body anyways I couldn't imagine it hurting but then again I do know that Tramadol affects brain chemistry a little different. 

If you can't get a good answer on here I would suggest downloading a texting/calling app (just so you can feel safe and remain anonymous) call the pharmacy and ask to speak with a pharmacist most will be very willing to help. Good luck‚úå

597^BagelKat24^opiates^I did word my first sentence weirdly because i was high so Im going to edit it because yes that is exactly what I ment it inhibits CYP2D6 which is the one of the main enzymes that breaks down opiates, both grapefruit juice and Benadryl do this üëçthere are actually alot of things that boost opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
598^FernTheGrassBoy^black^Mixed it with 40% alc. Drank too much and threw up 6 different times. Hangover all day. Tried it again being more careful and it potentiated the PhenylEthylAmines half life by a couple hours to be honest. I used it with red wine when it worked very well. When i did not overshoot the alc. Or the phenylethylamine. If i overshoot any one of the two i will feel like a boof and vomit every time i drink water. Otherwise when it worked it felt fucking amazing. I would be SURE to start out almost microdosing. About that really bad hangover..... my friends house had black mold in it so i felt like shit everytime i drank vodka there but it made it worse i think. Im glad you aked because i searched and found nothing and then realized how much of a gineu pig i am. How does one spell new gina?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
599^eddy898989^dreams^they are the worst things ever, it's torture. I would dream I'd go all the way to the cashpoint, wait 2 hours for my dealer then when I get home i'd set up my pipe and as soon i would put it to my mouth and hit it I would wake up, it's devastating. it was SO real. On days i use and finish i have dreams i still have some, I'd wake up all excited thinking I'd saved some but there would be fuck all.

The worst dreams are when you're in withdrawal, you're about to use it and you literally feel better like the withdrawal is gone but suddenly you wake up still sick, your heart just sinks and you could just cry forever. Its mental torture, fucking horrible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
600^whatspoppingang^opioid^Forgot to put this in my drug list, its a weak opioid, didnt do much for me unless I mixed with bud, dont drink on this. i drank an was throwing up a mixture of resin, morgan, and whatever else was in my body

601^bluejeans90210^china^Is anyone not surprised by the hospital conditions?  A friend bought a quarry in China because he wasn't happy with the quality of the materials - they'd hide substandard marble by having the end parts of the shipment fine, but the rest crappy, because nobody would bother to check.  And this is construction that was urgent therefore costly, therefore more profit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
602^YUNG-PHANTOM^opiates^You should be really careful about mixing benzos and opiates, that‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
603^wishesandhopes^black^It is 100% entirely racist to claim that someone selling shitty dope must be black. You're gonna need some mental gymnastics to claim that making literal negative assumptions about specifically black people is not racist. It's the definition of the word.

603^wishesandhopes^opiates^Yeah I've fucked a lot of girls since too since people say to do that. Last one was really hot and someone ive liked for years and she sent me a dream message, just asking to fuck directly. So we did, and I barely felt anything for her in the end. I just want my old girlfriend back. Opiates help but new girls don't. I dont do heroin but got 60 oxy 15s a while back. Finished em tonight.

603^wishesandhopes^black^I have been exploring it, I downloaded most of bladees discography but it's really vast and hard to find my favourite type of sounds he does. 

I'm not entirely new I just wanted to hear peoples favourite songs and check them out if I haven't, it's really not that deep just discussion my dr*iner. 

His stuff with black kray is amazing imo, blue juice is one of my favourite verses of bladee and kray

603^wishesandhopes^black^It jumped to black because they face much more prejudice in the United states than asian people. It's not common for racists to talk about drug ghettos of Asian people, they use black people as an example. So I'm comparing orange to oranges. Where I live the only sizable minority population is black people, as well.

605^Sooooooorganic^opioid^Let me reiterate a bit. So this isn‚Äôt something I believe myself, or rather really never thought about it. I have always not believed a lot of the hype about addiction and always felt one can use and recover fine but just recently I was in the hospital (non opioid related illness) and the doctor started talking to me about suboxone. I told him I would really only be interested in using suboxone to get through withdrawal and then stop taking it to avoid then having to taper off that. He then went on to tell me essentially I have to be on one or the other ( suboxone or dope) otherwise I will not feel pleasure and likely relapse. I just hate the idea of trading one for the other ( quiting dope to go on subs). If I get clean I want to be CLEAN and allow my body to begin getting used to having nothing. So ya I guess the doctor scared me a bit but I wanted to know if there is any truth to that. I mean sometimes when I haven‚Äôt used in like 24 hour, I already start to feel my senses and perception changing in the sense that things feel familiar, like they did before I started using. So if I can feel that way with just 24 hours off drugs I‚Äôd imagine weeks, months, years would do wonders, but from the conversation I had with the doctor he essentially is saying no. The doctor is saying I would need suboxone to essentially assist me back into life. Is this true or can I really just get off and start healing right away?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
606^quackslikeone^opiates^I only just recently realized that my 13 year relationship with opioids was the same as every other "I got hurt and the doctors just kept handing them out" story.

I had only taken opiates once before I was in a car accident in 2004. It was only soft tissue injuries and while it DID hurt, it didn't hurt nearly as much as I kept telling them. But what never hit home was that at some point the doctors have a responsibility to say No. The closest they came was saying, "You know they don't recommend opiates for people that develop a tolerance so quickly." And then they wrote the next script. In less than a year I was prescribed 120mg of Oxycontin with Percocet on top. (I've been told not even most cancer patients take this much.) 

But all I could think of was how I lied to and manipulated the doctors, not seeing that I was just part of the Great New American Tragedy. I wish all doctors would be as conservative with opiates as my recent surgeon. I had a wrist fracture that required a 4 hour surgery to put a plate in. When the surgeon gave me my prescription for 4 days worth of low-dose opiates he said, "Don't even ask for more, I won't do it."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
607^Ganjanthegr33n^black^i drink around 10+ cups of black tea every day. i was comparing the effects one cup had on my system when i didnt have tolerance to what   effect 2 cups have on me nowadays. you wanna tell me where i stated my daily consumption being 2 cups a day?

607^Ganjanthegr33n^china^the new order is already there, its not just america. the right wing populists are on the rise all across the world, china and russia are slowly climbing the ladder and taking on what was once americas role, everyone is isolating themselves thinking "my country first". i highly doubt america will be able to reclaim their throne that easily. the thing is that with this administration, its not just trump but the whole system that has been exposed as the corrupt swamp that it is. Americas image is beyond ruined, not just because of trump. unless there are fundamental changes to the system, i doubt anything will change. if sanders wins, the republicans will just keep on sabotaging everything the democrats plan on doing so they can let them look as bad as possible. a country that runs on such an antiquated 2 party system, a system that does not even decide on its leaders by the total number of votes, is not fit to be at the top of the world order in these modern times.

edit: typos

607^Ganjanthegr33n^opium^>It isnt a drug, its a plant

sure buddy... and opium is just dried flower juice lol.

>Weed is the less harmful drug there is, because its a PLANT.

what the fuck kinda logic is that?  anything thats a plant cant be bad for you? heroin comes from a plant. wtf. weed is one of the most harmless drugs because the cannabinoids that get you high simillar to neurotransmitters your brain already produces on its own so its very easy for your body to get rid of them. THATS why its harmless. not because its a fucking plant. there are enough plants out there that will kill you if you take a bite.

607^Ganjanthegr33n^opiates^i get upset when addicts downplay the addictive potential of a drug to new commers, especially on a sub whose audience consists of like 50% teenagers. this isnt just a circlejerk for stoners. this sub is supposed to educate people and teach harmreduction, and have a platform for people to share their drug storys. you guys dont seem to have a problem harassing anyone who shares their storys with stuff like meth or opiates, but as soon as i tell you weed can have a bad impact on your life like literally any other drug out there, you guys get all upset.  im not telling you weed is the devil. im asking you to stop pretending like its not a drug.

609^sipsip_slow^black^adjustable blade means you can adjust the blade by opening the lever. If you look at the fast feeds, on one side next to the head they have a small black lever. You can adjust the lever just by pulling it back and it pushes the teeth forward, and makes it cut longer/shorter. Pulling/pushing the lever is called opening/closing the lever. When it‚Äôs fully closed it‚Äôs a 0 and when it‚Äôs fully open it‚Äôs 1. You also use guards with it.

If you‚Äôre still confused watch this vid, he‚Äôs using the Oster fast feeds and he demonstrates opening the lever in the first 2 mins. It‚Äôs also a good tutorial, even tho his cuts aren‚Äôt as clean as 360 Jeezy or Chris Bossio (prolly the best barber tutorials on YouTube )

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uYjjDbFgdjs

609^sipsip_slow^black^Me alone? Obv not. But hundreds of thousands of innocent ppl üíÄ it‚Äôs not the same bro üòÇ. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre black, and the govt randomly starts arresting, killing, torturing and raping black families and children, and nobody pays attention or cares enough to even protest the government to push for intervention. No riots or anything. You wouldn‚Äôt see anything wrong with that, just because they‚Äôre not black so it doesn‚Äôt affect their life personally? 

Btw that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening to Muslims in China. I don‚Äôt see any riots in the skreets tho. Here or in China. And btw, if they DID riot in China, the govt would just start killing the protestors, because it knows for a fact that the world will let them get away with it, because we only care when it‚Äôs someone like Kobe who dies... it‚Äôs exactly this kind of dick-riding apathy that you‚Äôre defending üíÄ

Not saying I‚Äôm a hero of the ppl Cos I haven‚Äôt been out rioting or protesting either. But I at least have the basic sense of humility to recognise that if I‚Äôm not going crazy posting about the persecution and killing/rape/torture of millions of other humans that‚Äôs happening right now (the worst since the holocuast/WW2 in China + Syria) then why the fuck would I say its a TRAGEDY that a basketball player died in a helicopter crash? üòÇ

615^britishdude1984^dreams^I have various dreams of being various people in various places (not people or places I know).

615^britishdude1984^black^I think the only people who like Beyonce are either feminists or gay, at least I've never met a straight, male Beyonce fan, so I think amongst people atracted to women, this is a popular opinion. She's just another fake looking celeb like Kim K, curvy too, which as I learnt on here alot, if not most people don't actually find attractive. If she had any pretty features, they got evicted from her body a long time ago. Also, in Hollywood white celebrities go dark and get a fake ass to try to become black and black celebrities get straight blonde hair and a nose job to try to become white, it ruins natural beauty.

615^britishdude1984^black^Same in the UK. I'm a blonde man, never get joked about. The jokes are about women. Still, I don't know why people pick on us, gingers are much more amusing... I suppose it started with Bimbos, who were dumb "blonde" women (They were actually black haired/brunettes who dyed their hair).

615^britishdude1984^opiates^Cocaine releases dopamine and neurepinephrine.
You're getting a dopamine rush (similar to opiates, sex, food) and a neurepinephrine rush, neupinephrine reuptake inhibitors are used to treat anxiety and depression (it's a stimulant, but also stabilised mood)

TLDR: I've never done cocaine but from what I know about pharmacology it should boost mood and energy without causing anxiety (Come down anxiety is a thing though, and can include psychosis, not a good drug to use regularly IMO).

618^SusieSuze^black^I have my methods that make it super easy. The base colour of my hair is predominately white. The darker your hair, the less vibrant the results. Henna does not open your cuticle to lighten your natural base colour. There is no damage. You cannot remove henna once it binds to the keratin in your hair. You cannot bleach it. It must grow out. Never apply chemical treatments such as perms, relaxers, dyes, over henna. Results can be scary, I‚Äôve heard. 

Once you decide you want to keep doing henna for a year or more, you can buy 1 kg bag of body art quality mehandi henna. The Indian grocer has it here in Vancouver. $8 

Put the whole bag in an extra large mixing bowl. Pour in a pot of extra strong black coffee bit by bit. Blend with hand mixer. Keep adding coffee until it becomes like a yogurt (not like thick Greek.. like the other style). Not payable but almost. You may need more coffee so brew up some more and why not have a cup. At this point I add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of Amla oil that I also buy in that grocery store. It smells great and is a nice conditioner. Spoon into 4-6 containers and freeze. Of course, don‚Äôt freeze until you‚Äôve used the first batch on your head, fresh. 

The next time you henna, take a container from the freezer and partially thaw it out in the microwave (5 minutes is probably enough) just thaw enough to have a reasonable amount in the corners around the edges. 
Use what you need and refreeze the rest. One kg lasts a year or more for me. 

When applying the first time, you need complete coverage. Use hair colour method of using a professional brush and 1/4 to 1/2 inch sections. Make sure to use a lot of product. Henna needs to really be thick, especially around the edges of your face. Those darn sideburn hairs are often missed. It took several times to realize I really needed to slather it on for it to cover properly. 

When needing your regrowth done- just do the roots! Overlapping is never an issue. You don‚Äôt need to pull the henna through. You may want to do all over henna once every 3-6  months. Don‚Äôt be afraid of staining clothes, carpets tiles or counters. It all washes out. Henna only bonds with Keratin in your skin nails and hair. So don‚Äôt forget to wear gloves!! 

Wrap head with long pieces of plastic cling wrap until it is sealed in there really well. I go way over the edges, over my ears and almost my eyes. Do not let any hair be exposed as henna needs to be wet to work. 

Leave in for 3 hours and get in the shower with gloves on and rinse rinse rinse until the water is clear, then shampoo. Then condition. Clean your ears really well because it often has crept it‚Äôs way into the crannies. Hopefully you have a shower head with a hose so you can wash the shower enclosure easily. 

Wrap a towel on your pillow until you‚Äôve had a couple of more chances to shampoo or condition your hair. Don‚Äôt wear white TShirts with wet hair for a week or two. What rubs or drips off won‚Äôt stain permanently, so don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs just a bit of a nuisance. 

If you want to cover grey and you like bright copper hair, henna is miracle. I worked for an international hair colour brand and taught hair stylists how to use that colour. I used the best products. I know hair colour and NOTHING BEATS HENNA. Grey coverage- 100% AMAZING. 

NO FADING!! Unless you spend a crazy amount of time in the sun you will not notice any colour difference. After 3 weeks of every day in the sun for hours in Spain it faded a bit but still looked glorious. 

CHEAP!! a year of colouring my own hair would have cost me about $350 and that‚Äôs at wholesale price of professional colour. Henna is $8 Plus coffee. 

Natural, non toxic non polluting. 

Hope this helps someone!!

619^Backwoodaday^opiates^Man the regulations they give these doctors  & pharmacists is ridiculous.  I definitely remember those days lol.. when opiates weren‚Äôt very profound

619^Backwoodaday^opiates^I don‚Äôt drink at all lol not my fort√®... but yeah I‚Äôm not benzo na√Øve, a period of my life contributed to Xanax addiction. It‚Äôs rough man but let me tell you, Xanax withdrawals are Heaven compared to opiates (mainly oxycodone) these are PURE HELL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
620^AgingHippieLiberal^opiates^Dude where in the fuck did this logic come from? Did you know pharmaceutical companies produce IV opiates, are you saying that because they're meant to be injected shooting up some IV Fent won't work?

620^AgingHippieLiberal^opiates^I'm gonna be blunt and honest here.

> I hope that I won't be able to find opiates there. 

You're hoping for the wrong thing, stranger. You need to hope that you can stay strong, or that your life will get back on track, or that you can one day feel normal again. If you're thinking to yourself "I hope I can't find any" and that hope doesn't come true, you're relapsing. If your hope to stay strong doesn't, you can build strength. If your life doesn't begin to get back on track, 1 at least it isn't any worse than last week, and 2 you can start getting it in track. If you never feel "normal" again at least you don't have to use drugs every day to reach a baseline.

622^gremilinswhocares^opiate^The point I think the show was making was that no opiate would work because your horribly radiated body couldn‚Äôt even physically/chemically make use of it, not an issue of strength.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
623^feetman100^opiates^So braces.

I'll recommend substances in a second but they are made from a cold bending metal so if you eat something cold, like ice cream, they should give you a brief moment of bliss. They go back to their original shape if exposed to heat.

So things I will recommend.

Cloves- works very well to numb certain points of the mouth. Just chew on it and keep the saliva in your mouth for as long as possible. 

Oral gel/benzocaine- pretty efficient as a local anesthesia.

Acetaminophen and ibruprofen- can be used in tandem and is MORE effective at treating tooth pain than most opiates.

Alcohol- works good as both a "numbing agent" and a distraction.

Weed- pretty decent pain relief with added distraction but if you focus on pain will literally feel 10x worse than sober.

If you're experiencing migraines from tooth pain- I recommend caffeine from 50-150 mg, don't exceed or it will make it worse.

623^feetman100^opium^I did not say it wasnt addictive, literally all opiates are addictive, I said it wasn't heroin which is much stronger and far more dangerous than opium.

623^feetman100^opiates^Opiates can cause that too, if you're worried go to a hospital, means you definitely overdid it.

623^feetman100^opiates^You just took too a high a dose for a beginner, you'll be ok but if you feel that if you need help don't hesitate to go to the hospital. 

Opiates will slow down your heart and breathing rate, very normal, just make sure you stay awake and are sitting up and it'll pass. 

Opiates also release histamine (the stuff responsible for allergies) so that's why you're itchy.

623^feetman100^opiate^So first of all using drugs to cope with any sort of mental health disorders can lead to psychological addiction, or further potentiate the underlying issues. I recommend some therapy (doesn't work for everyone, I know), and I really recommend getting into exercise and health.

That being said in the short term they can help, and coupled with actively trying to improve your mental health can decrease anxiety and depression to a manageable degree. 

1. GABA substances. These are things like alcohol, benzodiazepines (valium, xanax, etc), phenibut, gabapentin, or pregabalin. These should NEVER be used for managing general anxiety of day to day, or chronic anxiety and should really only be used for panic or anxiety attacks. Using for coping with day to day anxiety (no matter how bad) WILL lead to psychological addiction, and if chained together for multiple days will lead to physical addiction with horrendous withdrawal symptoms that can lead to death in severe cases.

2. THC and CBD, aka weed (sort of). For general anxiety CBD is the one for you, lasts about 5 hrs and while not an incredible decrease in anxiety, should bring it down to manageable levels. THC, the main psychoactive compound can also have anxiety reducing effects, but is also noticeably psychoactive and can also lead to anxiety. Make sure you know what you're smoking and lean towards heavier CBD than THC. (Hard drug)

3. Psychedelics. This includes things like psilocybin mushrooms and LSD, and basically for SOME people can be like a 6-12 hr therapy session with permanent decreases in anxiety and depression. That being said they can also exacerbate residual issues, or trigger other anxiety disorders. If you have no experience with psychoactive substances, do not start with psychedelics. Also they are not physically or psychologically addictive, but can wreck havoc on your mental state if unprepared.

4. Other hallucinogenic substances. Things like MDMA or ketamine have been shown in medical studies to have extremely beneficial therapeutic effects, like decreased depressive symptoms or the ability to cope with PTSD. That being said, MDMA can be a very dangerous substance and ample care and research should be taken when taking this substance.

5. Other shit. Kratom is an opiate that is currently rising in popularity and notoriety. It seems to be pretty expensive per dosage but is legal, but because it is an opiate should be taken with care and not repeatedly over multiple days. Kratom is less addictive psychologically than other opiates, like heroin, but withdrawing physically can have very similar effects. As for danger, chronic use has pointed towards some kidney or liver damage, but theres not a whole lot of research to that degree. 

I AM NOT A DOCTOR. ALL SUBSTANCES LISTED SHOULD BE RESEARCHED BY YOU.

But jumping straight to drugs has never worked for anyone and should be treated with extreme care as to not become addicted or psychologically dependent on a substance. Get into exercise, meditation, therapy, and a schedule before ever going to substances. 

Clarification: when I say general anxiety I mean the constant level of anxiety you suffer from from a day to day basis, not random spikes triggered at random or by something.

If you want the "softest" (least likely to lead to psychological or physical addiction with little to no physical damage after extensive use) I recommend CBD or low dose THC edibles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
624^thelemonx^opioid^Well, I have a rather unusual opioid story.

I have been prescribed narcotics for the entirety of my adult life.  Initially, they were for chronic orthopedic pain.  That issue was resolved surgically after 15 years.  I thought I was done with pain and pain pills.

Not long after I started to get used to a life without pain, I severely burned.  I still had a significant tolerance.  In the burn unit, I told them I was opioid tolerant, and the medication wasn't working very well.  They increased my dose and dosing frequency until it achieved satisfactory pain relief.

I didn't even get a chance to fully heal from the fire when I got diagnosed with brain cancer.  The location of my tumor causes Central Pain Syndrome, which for me manifests as constant pain throughout my lower body.  They thought I would only live a short while, but I'm still here, and unfortunately I still hurt.  Again, typical starting doses didn't cut it.  I told my doctors.  They increased the dose.  Most of the time I can actually forget that I even have cancer, all of my symptoms are adequately treated.

624^thelemonx^dreams^I have 9 year old twin sons who are much kinder and more understanding than I was at that age.

2 years ago I had surgery to remove part of a brain tumor.  Not long after I got home, one of my boys said to me, "Dad, want to know what my favorite thing in the world is?  When we're going for a walk, cooking supper, folding clothes, and we just talk to each other."  I replied, "Your favorite thing in the world is talking to your dad?"  My heart melted.  He is a very kind boy.  Earlier this winter he came home from school, and he said, "Can we get a new pair of mittens next time we go to town?  My friend doesn't have any."

Last summer the other boy shocked me.  Out of the blue he said, "Dad, want to know my favorite thing about people is?  Every person has their own story, where they came from, where they're going, and their own hopes and dreams"  

They have a level of kindness and empathy I wouldn't expect from most adults, let alone children.

624^thelemonx^black^I have nearly died 5 times now.

*1, I was camping with some friends back in high school.  I decided to sneak up on them by crawling under a truck.  I was under the front driver's tire when the truck started backing up on me.  Thankfully she immediately hit the brakes, shifted into Drive instead of running me over the rest of the way.  I had a tire mark on my back for months after, but I'm still alive.  
This one felt different than the others.  The other 3 times I was slowly dying, this one would have been very abrupt, but it didn't happen, so I never had the 'light at the end of the tunnel' or anything like that.  One second I was being run over, then I wasn't.

*2, My wife ended a relationship to be with me.  This guy wasn't too happy about this.  She and I got married 2 years later.  Shortly after our wedding we saw her ex at a bar.  He asks me to come outside ALONE to 'apologize' for 2 years of harassing us and threatening me.  I should have known better.  Next thing I know I get hit on the back of my head, and someone is holding me down choking me.  My vision was fading to black, light at the end of the tunnel and all that.  For a moment I conceded that I was simply going to die.  As the last bit of light fades out, I somehow managed to find the strength to get them off of me.  My wife had heard the fight and she came out to help, someone else grabbed her to keep her from helping me.  Once I got up I was able to help her.  We ran to our car and sped away.  Later we found out that her ex had paid 2 people to kill me.  And to make it even worse, the price to end my life is only $50 worth of meth.
This one scared the shit out of me, but in the moment I was fading into the black, I felt a calm peace, then found strength that I didn't know I was capable of, and that strength is what allowed me to survive.

*3, I had burned my foot and leg in a brush fire, and needed skin graft surgery.  The day after my surgery, I had a fever, obviously from an infection.  My nurse kept coming in and checking my temperature, and it kept going up.  They changed my bandages and put on more antibiotic cream.  Temp went up higher.  They changed bandages again and tried a different antibiotic cream.  Temp went higher.  They changed bandages again, and gave me oral antibiotics.  Temp went higher.  They changed it all again and gave me IV antibiotics.  Again my temp went up.  Once more they changed everything, and increased the IV.  I heard someone say "He's at 41.6" (107F for those who prefer Fahrenheit) as I started to fade out.  I was convinced that this was going to be the end of me.  I closed my eyes to picture my wife and kids and to pray for them to carry on without me.  I open my eyes, and my room filled with glowing light.  A "nurse" came in, whispered, "You're going to be alright" in my ear, and left.  I felt an all encompassing comfort, and knew I was OK.  My "real" nurse came in to take my temp and it was back to normal.  A few I put nurse in quotes because the woman I described to my previous nurse does not exist.    
The actual moment close to death was the same as before.  Just a calm peace.  Like I knew it wasn't my time, but when that time did come it would be OK.

*4, A year and a week after the fire I had my 4th surgery on the burn.  The next day I had a terrible headache, and I was unable to keep any food or liquid down.  Each day the headache gets worse.  It eventually gets to be unbearable.  The ONE time I look up my symptoms on WebMD, it tells me I have Brain Cancer, I shrug it off thinking there's no way.  I told my wife, "This headache hurts more than being on fire did."  She convinces me to go to the doctor.  I thought it was just leftover effects from anesthesia, and I planned to just power through.  I go to the doctor, and he thinks the same thing, gives me IV fluids and a steroid shot and sends me on my way.  The next day I go back.  When I told him that the headache was waking me up in the night, he ordered a CT scan.  A headache should NEVER wake you up.  CT shows a 'mass' in my brain.  He makes an appointment at a larger hospital for the next day, and I have surgery to remove part of the tumor the following day.  Something 'bad' happened during the surgery, so I woke up in the ICU instead of the room I started in.  I don't remember what it was that happened, but they were unable to give me any pain medication after surgery because it could have masked the brain damage they were afraid might have happened.  I was at the lowest point of my life, I had never felt pain anywhere close to this, it was so painful that I actually believed I was dying.  Just like in the burn unit a year prior, I closed my eyes and imagined my wife and kids, and I prayed that they would be OK without me.  I open my eyes, and my room is glowing bright again.  The same 'nurse' from the burn unit came into my room, and told me I was going to be alright.  As she left I felt that same comfort throughout my entire being, and I knew I was going to be OK.  
Again, just that same calm peace.

*5, This spring I was in Northern Minnesota.  I go up there with my wife's uncles for our annual guys fishing trip.  I am a photographer, so I spend part of the trip by myself in a canoe looking for spots to take pictures.  I do the same thing every year, but this year I put on a lifejacket before heading out.  After a while I decide to head in for lunch.  The wind made it very difficult to get to where I wanted to go.  Long story short, I end up tipping the canoe.  
For a short while I was able to hold my upper body out of the water, but the wind picked up again and I lost hold of the canoe.  I don't know the exact water temperature, but there was still ice on the lake 6 days earlier, so it was in the upper 30s to lower 40sF.  The shore seemed impossibly far away, and my strength was fading fast.  For a moment I considered unbuckling my life jacket to let myself sink to the bottom.  I figured quickly drowning would be better than slowly freezing to death.  I close my eyes, and in my mind I saw a recent picture I had taken of my wife and kids.  I decided I wasn't going to freeze or drown, I was going to get out.
About 50 yards from shore I stopped shivering, and felt nice and warm.  For a moment I thought I was just in shallow water and it actually was warm, then I remembered that this was the end stages of hypothermia.  I give my last strength to get to shore.  I get to shore in neck-deep water.  I grabbed hold of some reeds to try and pull myself out.  I pulled on them 3 times.  I was too weak to get out.  This time I was convinced I was going to die right then and there.  Everything was fading to black, again I saw the light at the end of the tunnel, but this time, unlike the others, the tunnel closed.  A moment later the blackness turned to white, and I was sitting on shore.  I will never be convinced that this wasn't divine.  
After a while I think to take off my clothes, to get that cold water off of my skin.  It took every ounce of my strength to get undressed.  I realized that I was barely breathing, tried to check my pulse, but it was too weak to count.  It was sunny and 82F, but I was laying there dying.  I finally think that I should be yelling for help.  Everyone else was in the cabin having lunch.  Everyone except for my wife's cousin, he was fishing off of the dock.  He went inside and said, "I *THINK* I hear someone yelling for help".  Somehow he heard me from over half a mile away.  Nobody questioned him, they all got on the boat to look around.  Hearing the sound of that motor filled me with joy unlike anything I'd ever felt.  I was lying in the reeds, and with my clothes off I blended right in.  I tried to sit up to make sure they saw me, but I couldn't move, hypothermia was closing it's icy grip.  
They found me when they saw the canoe floating nearby.  Again, I tried to get up, but I couldn't.  They had to pick me up and put me in the boat.  We got back to the cabin, and they carried me off the boat.  I had them put me in a chair in the sunshine, they found my warmest clothes, and put them on me.  I had one of the guys make me a pot of tea, nothing on this earth will ever taste as good as that first sip of warm tea.  
That cold water was by far the most terrifying experience of my life.  None of the others come anywhere close in comparison.  But that moment when I was right up to the line of dying, I was filled with that same peace and comfort as before.

TL:DR
I have come close to death 5 times in my life.  3 of them were within the last 3 years. 

For 4 of them, the near-death part was very similar.  I was slowly progressing toward death, my vision was fading to black, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
The moment I start coming back to my senses I was filled comfort and peace far beyond anything else.  Each time I somehow knew that it wasn't my time, but when my time comes it will be OK.
The other event was different.  While the other 4 were like a dimmer switch with me fading into the dark, this was just on/off.  I didn't experience anything unusual this time.

624^thelemonx^opioid^Hydroxyzine does potentiate opioids.  Just a note, potentiation is different than synergy.  For example, Benadryl synergies with opioids by increasing sedation.  Potentiation can take place at any part of the liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of the drug and actually increases the effect of the opioid instead of just making you more tired.

>For example, hydroxyzine or dextromethorphan is used to get more pain relief and anxiolysis out of an equal dose of an opioid medication.

Potentiation in regards to opioids is called 'opioid-sparing'.  You actually need less of the opioid to achieve the same effects, or an equal dose giving more effects.

624^thelemonx^black^I have an interesting story about hojicha - 

Last spring, I was up in Northern Minnesota for our annual Guys Fishing Trip. Friday morning I head out on the canoe. Not long after, I freak gust of wind tips me into the cold, black water.  I end up swimming half a mile in a 40¬∞f lake, it still had ice cover 6 days prior.    
I finally get to shore, and somehow manage to get out of the water.  The sun was shining and it was 82¬∞f, but I was lying there dying.  Hypothermia had gotten too far for my body to reheat. Luckily, I was rescued before succumbing to the cold. 

The guys got me back to the cabin and put warm clothes on me, I asked one of them to put some water on so I could have a cup of tea.

That first sip of Hojichi was indescribably magical. Nothing on this earth will ever taste as good as that warm tea did.

624^thelemonx^black^Like others stated, teabags are only good for a single infusion.  The particles of tea leaf are so small that all the flavor is going to be extracted very quickly.

Here are my favorite teas and how many times I usually brew them    
Longjing (Green) - 3   
Silver Needle (White) - usually 6      
Lapsang Sochung (smoke cured black) - 3 or 4      
Golden Snail (Black) - 5 or 6      
Pu'erh (Fermented Black) - 6+ sometimes even more than 10  
Ting Tung (Oolong) - 5 or 6    
Milk Oolong (Oolong) - 4    
Darjeeling - (Black) - 2 or 3  

Just some guidelines to get you started.  It really depends on a lot of variables.    
Tea:  type, leave size, quality  
Leaf to Water ratio  
Brew time  
Personal preference, you might like your tea a little stronger or weaker than others do

625^UnknownEntity1234^opiates^This. Exactly what I was going to say. Look for people getting their sheets signed. Don‚Äôt ask people that ‚Äúshared‚Äù in the meeting, look for people that seem to be high. Hell I swear I can hear it in people‚Äôs voices when they use dope/opiates. Anybody else experience this phenomenon? Hear a difference in people‚Äôs voice on opiates?

625^UnknownEntity1234^opiate^GP can write methadone only for pain management not for OUD- opiate use disorder. So in theory a doc could write you methadone as long as he says it‚Äôs for pain management. Really hard to find a doc to do this unless you are a legit pain management patient. I have known exactly one person that left the clinic because his doc at the VA was going to write his methadone for him. Also typically doses for pain management are lower than what is used for OUD.

625^UnknownEntity1234^opiate^I understand the anxiety that comes with opiate withdrawal. I really do. That being said, This advice should be taken with a grain of salt, because it may not be conducive to ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù.  I would just make sure the rehab prescribed medication. In general benzos are given for benzo dependence and alcohol dependency. I was never physically dependent on either of those but whenever I went to rehab I made sure I had both in my system and self reported abuse and dependency of benzos and alcohol so I would get better meds. Did it work? Yes for me. I got Valium and phenobarbital (my personal favorite!). It also led to increased restrictions at first at one rehab- I couldnt go off site the first week. I didn‚Äôt mind though. Hope the advice helps!

625^UnknownEntity1234^opiate^I recommend miralax. It‚Äôs not a stimulant laxatives so you don‚Äôt become dependent on it. It works by drawing more water into the dry compacted little goat turds that come with opiate use. Drink lots of water too. It can take 24 hrs plus to work, but it doesn‚Äôt cause cramping. I take prescription linzess everyday and still have to supplement with 3 doses of miralax to get good movement. I also have IBS so my stomach is always doing stupid stuff and hurting like a motherfucker. Good luck shitting!

626^london1640^black^I believe that terms like ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòbad‚Äô start to lose their meaning when you are acting under some kind of compulsion.

You did a good thing today, unprompted.  You are a good person today.  Yesterday you were driven to steal in desperation.  Yesterday you were neither good nor bad, you just did what you did.

Obviously it is not black and white, but I don‚Äôt feel you are 100% morally responsible under these circumstances.  Is it wrong for a starving person to steal food?  

That is not to say in any way that you should not own every one of your past actions, merely that you should be realistic about the degree of choice that you genuinely exercised.

626^london1640^opiate^I respectfully disagree with the other two responses to this comment.  A buprenorphine taper is standard practice in lots of places. Everyone is making it sound like some sort of life sentence! A close friend of mine just came off a taper of a few weeks, following an opiate binge which wasn‚Äôt nearly as serious as yours.

Honestly, have faith in your doctor.

626^london1640^dreams^Actually I always wanted to be a bin man.  They showed us a video at school about how important the work is.  My parents didn‚Äôt think much of the idea.  I should have followed my dreams, I probably would have been happier.

626^london1640^opioid^I‚Äôve had a quick glance at your post history and I see that you are not opioid naive.  I also see that you have access to benzos.

Smoking is the best way to do #3.  It gives a rush which snorting doesn‚Äôt, and you can smoke until you get where you want to be, whereas with snorting it‚Äôs more of a guessing game.  It‚Äôs easy to snort more and more looking for a certain high and end up puking your guts out. You might burn a bit of dope learning to smoke, but it‚Äôs less than what you‚Äôd waste snorting it.

It really matters to me that you are safe.  I‚Äôm not encouraging you to do h, but if you are going to then you should know where the risks lie so that you can avoid them.

Test for fent.  It‚Äôs uncommon in UK #3 but it‚Äôs not unheard of and testing is not a hard thing to do, so don‚Äôt take any shortcuts.

Secondly, DO NOT MIX.  I see you‚Äôve got bars and Valium there, perhaps you like a drink too (don‚Äôt we all).  Plenty of people on this sub mix it all up, but don‚Äôt follow their example.  If you smoke clean #3 on its own, then your risks of OD are really very small.  Add anything else in, and all bets are off.  There‚Äôs just no point in multiplying your risk by x10,000.  Also, benzos, booze etc affect your judgement, and you need your wits about you when messing with this stuff.

Finally, be extra extra careful if using on your own.  All these stories ‚Äúyo I did this and that and had to be narcanned‚Äù, well, they‚Äôre only here to tell that story because someone was on hand to call for an ambulance.

Sorry for the lecture, but you owe it to yourself to be safe.

626^london1640^dreams^I have super vivid dreams when sober following a binge.  Like just now I woke up from a dream in which I thought I watched an arty film about a girl with psychosis.  It was incredibly long and detailed and I can still remember lots of it.  If the film existed I would recommend it to everyone!

Yesterday was second day sober after a two-day binge, but I am still not back to normal.

627^HtownChiller420^china^What are you fucking babbling about?? Our concentration camps? You fucking kidding me hahaha. Eat shit bub now days are fucking nothin close to how bad it was back then. And like OP said you really expect the US to just invade China and start ww3?? I‚Äôm living my life alright I don‚Äôt owe the rest of the world shit. Until they come attack us I‚Äôm not getting involved in jack shit. Gitmo is a god damn day care comped to unit 701 ya fuckin puss

627^HtownChiller420^chocolate^Damn I‚Äôve been wondering this for years. Who the fuck buys this shit other then rich people having a big fancy party. I just feel like the people making this shit are just wasting time... I don‚Äôt even wanna call it chocolate if it tastes like shit and no one eats it. It‚Äôs just chocolate based modeling clay at that point. What a waste

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
628^staggerlee4242^opiate^Also it looks like part of your original question hasn't been addressed. Everyone is so different it's really hard to say where that tipping point of physical addiction is and once you really cross it it's just so hard to go back. I was about 14 or 15 when I started, so physically I was obviously still growing/developing which I'm sure affected the amount of time I was able to use without withdrawals, but I seem to remember it being several months before I was ever really truly dopesick. Dunno if that helps or not
 
Edit:

I also just noticed you said you've been messing with opis for about 10 years and have managed to avoid wd's. Now that is impressive. I really wouldn't push it any further if I were you (well clearly I would seeing my history...). Would be a damn shame to head down that road after so many years of successfully living every opiate addict's dream

628^staggerlee4242^opiate^I was much younger and more naive, up until that point had convinced myself that it wasn't that big of a deal! LOL! Guarantee those dudes I was involved with are still in prison! I've managed to be an opiate user/junkie for 25 or so years and have not been to prison! Jail, sure a hundred times. That was the wake up that I wouldn't always be lucky unless I found legit income.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
629^Thatni99a7^opiates^I read the post and comments and now I‚Äôm confused because when I take opiates I get a buzzed feeling, a heat flash and pass out for about 2 hours lmao

629^Thatni99a7^opiate^Man lmao and I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt get anymore after this unless it‚Äôs an actual emergency because my doctors are aware of my ‚Äúopiate addiction‚Äù according to them which sucks ass but hey thank you for the CWE help!

What have been your experiences with the hydros? Any close calls with certain doses or anything?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
630^MongoIsDead^black^Usually when I am actually aiming to hole I will be laying in bed in the pitch black. Next time though I‚Äôll see what it‚Äôs saying with just the lava lamp on

630^MongoIsDead^black^It‚Äôs nice. I like to be in the pitch black though when I k hole. Way better imo

630^MongoIsDead^opioid^Ah, thank you very much for the clear up lol! Good to know haha. One of my boys told me it‚Äôs an opioid, I guess not;( lol

630^MongoIsDead^opiate^Haha nah it‚Äôs all good man, I‚Äôd rather be told. Already gone through 9 lol... Rather underwhelmed unfortunately. I‚Äôve never really been a proper opiate user myself although they are fucking nice, nicest ones I‚Äôve tried were 40mg oxys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
631^sevennaps^opiates^Wow. A year! Now that's impressive. I'm a woman üòè but thanks, yeah it hasn't been easy. Months away!?!? OMG. I can't feel like this for months. You are right. Just recently I have been able to be a bit more comfortable, but RLS kicked in again last night. Do you think it's just the opiates or the combo?

631^sevennaps^opiates^This is true. I am in absolute hell. But I'm not going back now. I'm too far. The last 15 days have been utter and complete agony. In the beginning, only WD I could feel was opiates. Hell. Hell on Earth. I don't even understand how people can post in the first week. My first post was after 2 weeks clean because I physically could not move. I think what I'm feeling now is alcohol WD and nicotine. I can't tell. All I know is fuck that shit and the fuckers who make it.

631^sevennaps^opiates^Good for you. The cigs are tough to quit. Really tough. I really don't recommend quitting everything. It seemed like the right thing for me because my habits were hand in hand. Pop a pill, drink, smoke. If I'm not drinking I don't smoke. If I'm not taking opiates I don't drink. Very strange how our brain forms habits. Weed, caffeine, a bit of kratom. I'm keeping those 3, for nowüòè. Have a wonderful day, I'll check in with you later!

631^sevennaps^opiates^So I've been using kratom only if I need it. I took 8 mil yesterday to get me through the day. Most I've ever taken. What's your experience with it? I really want to rid of all substances, except weed occasionally, but after 8 yrs of daily opiates abuse plus alcohol abuse plus smoking I feel that kratom is ok for now? Or am I just getting myself into trouble?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
632^IShouldFindBlair^opiate^I mean, everyone‚Äôs chemical reception to opiates is different. But I will let you know that damn near every single opiate addict started out with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take them once every few months on occasion‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take them when I have easy access to them‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only take them on the weekends‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only take them at nighttime‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only dose twice a day‚Äù and then so on. So if I were you I‚Äôd turn back now and never look back, especially considering you‚Äôve had addiction issues in the past with other substances.

632^IShouldFindBlair^opiate^I mean, I truly think it‚Äôs different for everyone‚Äôs body. I‚Äôve been on Oxycodone for 20 years and yes, they work just as well for me as they always have. I‚Äôve never had to take more than 40mg a day, unless for surgery or something of that nature. I get excellent pain relief from my medication, and it‚Äôs worked better than even other opiates for me. Even stronger ones didn‚Äôt work as well (Dilaudid/Morphine). So I disagree, I think it absolutely is debatable. Everyone‚Äôs body composition is different. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the majority, but I know others with endometriosis who have been on an opiate for 30+ years, I also know someone who has been taking the same Oxycodone dosage for 26 years, she‚Äôs never abused her medication or had to raise her dose for adequate pain management. Idk man, I hear what you‚Äôre saying, and I agree, but the absolution and assertion you speak with as if it‚Äôs impossible, I disagree with.

632^IShouldFindBlair^opiate^I guess that‚Äôs very possible. However, I‚Äôve been on them 20 years now and have yet to have to move into insane dosages to still get pain relief. My comment about heroin or crack was that many think opiate use will always progress into harder/worse drugs.

632^IShouldFindBlair^opiates^It can absolutely be normal to get a little rebound anxiety from opiates. It could also be a sign you took a little too much, but not ‚Äútoo much‚Äù enough to cause overdose symptoms.

632^IShouldFindBlair^opiates^Absolutely. Just take it slow. You can always take more, you can‚Äôt take less after you‚Äôve taken it. Just remember that. My advice would be to not get into opiates at all but. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

632^IShouldFindBlair^opioid^Judging by your post history, it seems you‚Äôre developing a problem with your prescription. I can see why you‚Äôd be lashing out at others who benefit from opioid therapy long term, because it seems you aren‚Äôt in that class. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with telling your doctor you‚Äôd like to try other alternatives. Good luck.

632^IShouldFindBlair^opiates^If you really expected opiates for the FLU, you‚Äôre a moron. Jfc of course the flu sucks... it sucks for everyone. Wtf would you need opiates for the flu for?

632^IShouldFindBlair^opiate^Well, when it comes to opiates, many doctors err on the side of caution, especially considering opiates are meant for short-term use. And I have multiple chronic diseases and am on opiates myself, so I understand your frustration. Err‚Äôing on the side of caution may constitute seeing you more often to monitor your pain and opiate necessities. I‚Äôve met PM doctors who do much shadier things than simply wanting to see you every three weeks to maintain your pain medication prescription.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
633^The_Shepherds_2019^opiate^Judging by your grammar and spelling, you're either very young or very lacking in life experience. It's clear you have never been on MAT, because you would know it doesn't change your state of mind.

Yes, it alters your brain chemistry. As I stated, I know it is a partial agonist. It has a huge binding affinity for your opiate receptors. That's how it works. 

After abusing full agonists for a decade, a partial agonist is not changing my state of mind. I can say that with 100 percent honesty. I'm also, likely to a far larger extent than you, aware of the definition of high. 

I asked you to expound on your opinion. To which, you responded by attacking my knowledge. That's not what I want. Don't just say "lol no ur high". I really want to understand why you think the way you do. I, and anyone else on bupe, will tell you. We aren't getting high. We aren't nodding. So why, in your mind, does this not count as clean time?


Edit: Just wanted to add. Why do I take it, if it doesn't get me high? That's two-fold. First and foremost, it removed the cravings for heroin. Second, it staves off withdrawals. Both acute, and post acute. If you have ever gotten clean without MAT, you know the hell of PAWS. I can't do that on my own, yet. Hence the Suboxone.

633^The_Shepherds_2019^opiate^Thank you for an actual well thought out and valid counterargument. Yes, I've kicked bupe one time. It was similar to a mild heroin detox, only it lasted for over 3 weeks. Difficult, absolutely. Not unbearably so, though. I'm not looking forward to it, but I know I can do it. It's the PAWS that scares me.

As far as methadone and the Rx heroin they do in Europe....well that's a good question. I've never done methadone, but I've heard it gets you high. If that's the case, then no, I don't think I would consider that as clean. If you keep the dose low enough to where you don't get euphoria, then I suppose I would count it as being clean. The prescription heroin, depends on the dosage. We addicts have all been to the point where you are just using to get well. If the dosage is low enough that the patient is not getting any euphoria from it, then yeah, I personally would consider it clean.

I've taken subs in jail with no tolerance and gotten blasted. I've taken subs during addiction too early and gotten PWDs. Ive been taking subs now as maintenance, and have not gotten high. That's why I personally see it as being clean.

I guess the way to look at it is as a stepping stone. Using bupe to fix the issues in my life, while taking therapy to learn more about why I used in the first place. Attending outpatient to learn how to live sober. All while maintaining on Suboxone to stave off the apathy-inducing post acute withdrawal. Once I feel like my life is at a stable enough place, which should be soon, I'm going to start tapering off. Slowly. To allow my brain chemistry to begin adjusting to normal life, without the bupe saturating my opiate receptors. I know I'll still experience PAWS, but I'll be far more prepared for it than if I had just been banging dope a couple days ago.

633^The_Shepherds_2019^opiates^Honestly, if you are this scared, why are you even using opiates? Brain damage is caused by a total lack of oxygen to the brain for a period of time. If you were sedated enough to achieve this, you wouldn't have even been aware of falling asleep. You wouldn't have even fallen asleep. Your ass would've fallen out.

People legit OD every day and don't experience brain damage. üòê You were asleep on oxys, dude. Relax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
634^Fubar904^opioid^That‚Äôs just not true. Go to pain management if you legitimately need them. That‚Äôs the most likely place to get an actual opioid prescription. I‚Äôve never had a problem with my pain doctor prescribing them. 

Stop calling them ‚ÄúPerc 30s‚Äù. Those don‚Äôt exist.

634^Fubar904^opioid^And what are your doctors doing for your pain? UC and Chrons aren‚Äôt really the problems that opioids are designed to help. The constipation would undoubtedly make them worse. 

It also sounds like you were not at all using Gabapentin correctly. You don‚Äôt increase dosages like that. It takes weeks for Gabapentin to really begin working as it is supposed to. But yes, Gabapentin withdrawal was immensely worse than any opioid withdrawals I‚Äôve been through. 

Opioids, when used as designed and directed, DO work for most people. If someone misuses their drugs, that is on the individual. Like I said, Oxycodone has been absolutely amazing for me. I can see how people can become addicted and, for transparency, after all my time in Pain Management, I am addicted. My body is physically addicted to my medications. That‚Äôs not an unexpected consequence of using them. They do work. They do improve my life dramatically and they do for millions of people around the world. 

The epidemic is NOT from Prescription Pills. People are dying for pressed pills and laced heroin. Whether their addiction started from a prescribed pill, who knows. I can absolutely agree that they used to dispense pills way to easily a decade or so ago. But they are not prescribing like that anymore. People are not dying from prescribed medications. They are dying for their addiction and fake pills. There are ways that addicts can overcome the addiction but many don‚Äôt want to. That‚Äôs not a doctors fault.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
635^JerseyOwens^opiates^I'm not familiar w kratom but I've heard it becomes hard to get off just like any opiates if taken too long. The subs are just to get thru the worst of the withdrawls

635^JerseyOwens^black^I got two white ones so it's alittle easier than say a black or brown kat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
636^rlynotaname^opiates^English is not my first language so its often hard for me to get my point across ;)
What I meant to say:

I¬¥ve read a paper that concluded that some peoples bodys cant handle opiates as good as others. They may experience more or more intense side effects and are more prone to complications.

636^rlynotaname^opiates^I¬¥ve been having this ever since I started doing opiates
In the beginning it was just waaaay more stamina in bed but as time progressed it was more and more challenging to finish at all. 

When I am not that horny but do it for my wife sometimes I just cant finish. I could do her as long as my muscles and cirulatory system allow but no way to cum -.-

636^rlynotaname^opiates^Some people dont metabolize opiates that good. Be glad this stupid stuff wont get you hooked. So just better let it be

636^rlynotaname^opiates^I was speaking of doing both at the same time but keep in mind:


Every drug is gonna damage your health, some more (amphetamin) some less (opiates)

Combining drugs is even more detrimental

Seizures can even lead to death (i call that permanent health damage) so it would be very stupid to use a drug combination that heavily increases the chance of seizures when you already know that you are prone to seizures without said combination



At least dont be alone, DONT DRIVE, dont operate heavy machinery

636^rlynotaname^opioid^Maybe i was just lucky with the quality but without opioid tolerance 10-15g mixed with grapefruit juice gave me a real buzz. Only thing that stopped me from taking it was that I found it almost impossible to swallow that disguisting sandy stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
637^TATP1982^opiates^For someone with no dependency, who has never had one on opiates,  there will not be any withdrawals.  For someone who USED to be dependent, there could be mild withdrawal symptoms,  even after two years of clean time.  Once that pathway is created the brain is able to find it again pretty much right away.

637^TATP1982^opioid^No. Taking your normal dose won't really help. So, the best course of action is to avoid getting pwd in the first place.  Always take SMALL doses of buprenorphine, 1 to 2 mg increments every two hours. That way, if you do start to feel worse, it won't be nearly as severe and it will go away relatively quickly.  In order to reverse PWD, you would have to take a monsterous amount of what ever your DOC is and that may not even work.. plus, its very dangerous to do so. 

Buperenorphine has a higher binding affinity than almost everything except fentanyl and hydromorphone. Buprenorphine also has a much lower intrinsic activity.  Its this change in activity that causes PWD.. so, when the bupe rips the full agonist off the receptor and replaces it, there is a very rapid down regulation of opioid activity.  That is felt as severe withdrawal.

637^TATP1982^opiates^Maybe mild ? But it might not be. Since you have a previous dependance on opiates, that pathway gets reactivated fairly quickly. It will probably not be anywhere near as bad as it was the first time you detoxed.. but expect a few days of feeling like shite

637^TATP1982^opiates^Its the other way around.  Opiates after sub, receptors are blocked and nothing happens. Sub after opiates within the last 24 hours, PWD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
638^DrugFanatix^opiates^I know this is probably gonna get downvoted. I know this sub is mostly addicts. I've followed it for a while on this account. Just wanted to share my experience with opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
639^PoolOfTicks^opiates^Not the OPcommenter, but was in the same position. Needing to quit (and trying) for like 2 years (of my 5 year active) and finally only getting it to stick when I wanted it. I didnt know the difference between want and need at the time though. What changed for me wasn't anything actionable or even motivational, though.. everything around me was shit. I was sick and couldn't even get well because all the dope available was garbage. My money was gone, I was sick as hell, on the verge of losing my entire life and decided 'enough was enough'. 

Every person has their own reasons, it's different for every recovered addict out there. A lot of people will say they have to reach their 'bottom' first. But that looks different for everyone. The only constant seems to be that cliche of 'you only change when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change'. Whatever that means for a person.

I survived a trauma myself and used opiates to cope after benzos, alcohol, anonymous sex, and an awful bout of anorexia stopped 'helping'. I understand what he's facing and what relief heroin can give, he'll never feel that again and accepting that fact is the hardest bit of all. But. It's not healing whatever happened, it's hurting, deepening the wound and not even letting him scar. I'm sure he knows this but can't honestly feel this truth. Because it sure feels like it's helping... but that pain and that fear is biding its time right underneath, growing with every act of avoidance he engages in. It seems impossible to face and battle, so he uses, which makes it stronger and him weaker. There will be no healing and no moving on until he can stop using and confront the pain. 


I wish I had advice to give you to help him. But the only advice I have is to help you.. and that's to draw a bottom line and leave if he can't comply. And that could be 'for now' or 'until' he's proven his desire to be and stay clean if you really need that. Addiction will destroy everything you love in him as well as your good intentions. Whatever you do to try and help him will be twisted into the ugliest bullshit that only furthers his addiction and deepens both of your pain. It's gut wrenching to realize, but there's nothing you can do if he's justifying and bargaining because he's only proving to you that he doesn't want to change.

639^PoolOfTicks^opiate^Subs get you high at first. It's like a normal opiate high, but eventually they build up in your system and only make you 'well'/normal. 

Doctors prescribe methadone to addicts and methadone definitely gets you high when taking enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
640^drugsaremysidebitch^opiates^Yeah my trajectory is definitely upwards over the past couple years so that‚Äôs good I guess. 

I think the valium/booze hangover probably added to the negativity, but in the past few months I‚Äôve just had too many incidents of getting too drunk (with no benzos involved) and embarrassing myself. And I know it‚Äôs because I miss opiates and I‚Äôm just trying to compensate with something else. Haven‚Äôt felt that low in a while.

I gotta figure something out, that shit can‚Äôt keep happening.

640^drugsaremysidebitch^opiates^Yeah I totally know what you mean, I‚Äôm proud of myself when I don‚Äôt do something foolish now. Its so easy for some people, but for me I have to put in a serious concerted effort because my default is to just keep going until I‚Äôm fucking gone. 

It sucks because I‚Äôm doing so much better than I used to but I still suck. Like no heroin anymore. Almost never use benzos. Just a few oxys at the end of each month. So now I‚Äôm just drinking like an asshole. I know I‚Äôm overdoing it bc I just miss opiates so I‚Äôm numbing myself with whatever I can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
641^SovietDoc^opiate^Would kratom help only with stuff like psychological cravings or would it help with the physical withdrawals part too? I've heard people say that it's an opiate and others say it's coffee.

641^SovietDoc^opiate^I've tried a few times. I'm just looking for an opiate to ease the comedown from the stims I use on the weekend. H seems like the most cost effective.

641^SovietDoc^opiate^States domestic. Vendor has solid reviews. Personally sampled good shit from him although it wasn't an opiate. Also has oxy presses but honestly states they're made with fent. He says no fent on the china white though.

641^SovietDoc^opiate^I feel you bro. Been down this road with benzos. Started with etiz and clonazepam, ended up with clonazolam. Still trying to taper from abuse of that shit with diclaz.

I've tried H before. A point. I'd do tiny bumps  being opiate naive. It lasted me a couple months. One night I dicided to just go for a bigger bump like 3 times my usual baby bumps just to finish it, shit fucked me up. Ears clogging up, nausea, fighting to stay awake. Didn't really touch opiates apart from kratom. Recently found odsmt and been doing it daily for 2 weeks and also moved to boofing it.

20 mgs of norcos hitting already. Disappointing for 8 a pop gotta say, or maybe my tolerance is fucked from the other opis I've been taking, however this sort of warm feeling is making me crave a bit of that feeling I'd get from those times I'd tried H. Odsmt and kratom are more of a stimulating high. Appreciate you sharing your experience broski.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
642^666Groovy^black^My parents picked me up from drivers ed. I had just popped my first adderal 30 mg. Third time I had ever been high in my life. As my dad drives me home, I try to convince him that adderal will be the only thing that will make me as successful as he would ever want me too. I go home and do all the homework for that day and the days prior. I fell asleep and woke up to my mom getting me up for school. Still feeling the effects of the adderal, I run downstairs at record time and take a shower and get ready for school in a matter of ten to fifteen minutes. My mom calls me and stares my eyes down to see if they were dilated. At that point they weren‚Äôt. My dad sits me down and tells me he know I‚Äôm on adderal because he used to take black beauties in the day. He tells me I‚Äôm going down the wrong path as I deny everything. Ended up getting searched at school that day because I wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about adderal. Lol.

642^666Groovy^opiates^Kratom. Honestly a drug that has changed my life. It got me off of Xanax and adderal while also habitually taking opiates when I could find them. I take kratom now for pain, motivation, focusing tasks. Work, anxiety and being a better father. This is not the substance for everyone. But it could be your best friend if used with the right education.

642^666Groovy^opiates^I get this same effect from kratom which is very similar to the complex varieties of opiates. Doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of strain of kratom. I can always find a booth of endurance with lower doses. That added stamina and confidence makes you able to do things you never though. These means working your muscles so hard that the never thought was possible. Your body is overworked by that extra oomf the day before.

642^666Groovy^dreams^I do too buddy everyday. Adderal as well. That‚Äôs all my dreams consist of. Isn‚Äôt that just torture?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
643^Tacotaxitactical^black^And this was all in one year. Oh and my apartment had black mold the landlord didn't take care of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
644^pregnantgrandad^opiate^All you guys are making me very excited, found a plug in the uk that has almost every benzo and pharmama opiates about but I couldnt get any till  friday. 

Just chewed and swallowed 50mg of slow realease morphine and 2 xanax bars. Should I expected muich of a buzz from this? have close to no opiate tolerance so hopping for a good night tonight too but I know morphine oral BA is shit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
645^ctmorgs^opiates^Bro I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre projecting or what but I have myself under control lol. I‚Äôve had access to opiates for years and take them seldom. Benzos I do somewhat depend on for certain social situations but I‚Äôm not physically addicted to anything. I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm not on heroin?

645^ctmorgs^opiates^Appreciate the info but that‚Äôs just too thin a line for me to walk especially when I‚Äôm not nearly as close to addicted to opiates than I am close to addicted to benzos

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
646^lifeOnlifesTerms^opiate^Pain you have to almost  love it. 
Man up I've been told.
Mind over matter thinking will help.it gets me though alot.
I have both shoulders fix.i had my right foot crush by a fork truck 1.5 years ago it will never be the same.i also got two disc in my neck messing with me.
Being opiate free in all ways we must learn to live with pain and sorrow,a sober day is a victory.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^opiates^Tapering might help.it never helped me.only thing that got me clean was cold turkey.tapering just prolonged withdrawal,sorry
There's no way to avoid withdrawal symptoms even with a taper.its the price we pay to be free from opiates or anything else.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^chocolate^4 o 5 days is a dam good start.youd be past the worst.
But anyways detox is a bitch.been there..i think of how bad detox was.that keeps me clean.
I recommend trying to find a sub doctor
Not for subs but for.
Colidine,seroqeul,propranolol,maybe some gabs or a few benzodiazepines if your lucky.
The first 3 are ez to get from most docs that help people like us.tell them your struggles
If you can't get that.
I'd eat tons of chocolate and cheese.
Na meetings can really help.find one and find somethere.they will help alot.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^chocolate^A sober day is a victory.
Remember the withdrawal symptoms.
That keeps me clean from hard drugs.
Chocolate helps a lot when cravings come.im 6.5 months clean.be stronger than the craving it will pass

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^chocolate^Cravings are a bitch.
Try to find a na meeting.the people there are just like you.you don't got to do it alone.try eating chocolate for cravings. Cheeses can help too.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^opiates^Alcohol is a cns depressant.
I've drink few times myself.
It's safer than  opiates.
I myself smoke pot.its the less of the evils and my doc could care less about it.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^opiate^If i where to be blind fold me I wouldn't b able to tell the difference between kratom,subs,methadone from any real opiate.
Withdrawal symptoms are basically the same.your brain remembers.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^chocolate^Colidine and chocolate is all I had when I could turkey detoxed from iv fent.im not in withdrawal anymore.im on 6 months clean.after you detox it gets better.your not going to be perfectly fine.your mind is going to mess with you in many  ways.im still trying to figure stuff out.

Find your self a na meeting. People there know our struggles.

646^lifeOnlifesTerms^opiate^I took kratom for 2 years..after being on subs and methadone for years.i really can't tell the difference between kratom withdrawal and any opiate withdrawal.with that said kratom is a better option.just keep your dose of kratom to the lowest dose your body will let you.kratom can cause seizure at high doses.dont be like I was and take 45g a day.your asking for issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
647^Smallpandapop^opium^Hahaha the first time I nodded was playing rdr2. Oral opium from the webs. Fond memories, that's my dragon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
648^nigasploh^opioid^Damn you are arrogant. Again all you explained with your post is why withdrawals happen and you did not answer his question. You told him that he wont gett withdrawals if he got clean and used for a few days, but you DID NOT offer any scientific data for that.  Go ask any longterm opioid addict and they will tell you the same as I did. Your degree wont help you here but personal experience will.

648^nigasploh^opioid^When I was in rehab the top doctor for opioid dependency in europe told us that this is true. I guess you are smarter then him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
649^swar5484^opiate^I‚Äôve kicked Methadone and Heroin in jail.  I have a lot of respect for people who have went through detox from any opiate in jail.  It doesn‚Äôt get much worse than that.

649^swar5484^opiates^I‚Äôve heard Red Bali works best for coming off opiates.  I personally like White Maeng Da and Green Malay.  Buy-Kratom.US is cheap and top shelf.

649^swar5484^opiates^I‚Äôve read a lot of good stuff on here, but this is one of the better posts I‚Äôve seen on here.  Congratulations.  I‚Äôm a week behind you and just got done walking 6 miles.  I had like a Spiritual Awakening doing it cause I almost forgot I felt shitty.  

You also got to be careful what you read on here too, I tapered down off Suboxone after a long battle with all opiates.  I have to say this hasn‚Äôt been too bad so far, I‚Äôm on day 6 and it‚Äôs noticeable.  Watery eyes, waking at 2-3 AM, no appetite.  Nothing compared to kicking CT.  I‚Äôve gotten spooked a lot by the horror stories I‚Äôve read on here. 

Keep up the good work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
650^EarlyFlan^opiate^I think when I removed the need to use caffeine to survive work. I.e. quit my job and just relaxed and leisurely studied and practiced skills and made business ideas, I can joyfully drink a couple strong coffees a day. Also, I‚Äôm much healthier now. I eat a ton of food and really nutrient dense too. I‚Äôm a little chubbier but happier.
When I was working in high stress environment and chugging black coffee for energy, I crashed. I was also lean and barely ate enough and slightly hypothyroid.

I appreciate and respect your experience because it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm not saying you didn‚Äôt experience what you did. What I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôve been there. When I first started coffee it was like that, euphoric and great and then eventually run down and beat to crap. Quitting, starting, quitting starting. Now I drink coffee because it is really a joy and i don‚Äôt feel any of the negatives unless I purposefully overdose as a health experiment. Coffee really helps metabolism and liver in my experience. The reason I am making a case for it is I know if someone has a problem and wants to quit, they might be coming from where I was at, where coffee felt so good it became a drug of abuse. 

Anyways. If you do ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù take my advice. Eat some liver or oysters, any super nutrient dense food, but those are tops, and after that drink a strong coffee with a ton of milk and sugar, and some salt and gelatin or collagen powder. Just try it once, if you‚Äôre gonna drink it anyways. Maybe take some aspirin with it. And eat enough food. You might be amazed at how it can make you feel with so little downside and being so sustainable.

I really empathize with what you are saying because I‚Äôve been there. It fucked my mental state up too. But now it‚Äôs a boon. If you felt the way I felt off some of the ideas presented by ray peat you would be as enthusiastic in sure. I respect everyone‚Äôs experience but if you try what I‚Äôm saying and your nutrition is in line to support the increase in metabolism you‚Äôll quickly understand my POV. But also in the same way I reached this point due to some determination based on the way others described it. I had to experiment a bit and get diet in order before the positives greatly outweighed negatives.

As far as neurotransmitters go‚Äî- I have been a recovering opiate addict. I was really worried about anything that‚Äôd mess my chemistry up. I don‚Äôt want to feel bad. I always thought my chemistry was more sensitive and prone to anxiety and depression. So if I say coffees not an issue anymore in this way I hope it makes an impression.

I‚Äôm glad u read that link, ray peat has some really interesting and for me, helpful ideas. His info changed the way I view diet and health, I basically abolished my orthorexia via his writings and related info. If you stay true to staying off caffeine then my hats off to you sincerely. I respect anyone‚Äôs decision to make a sacrifice to better their health and life.

650^EarlyFlan^dreams^Will do. I often ask Jesus to help me when I fall prey to sexual thoughts and it works.

The most unsettling thing is my wet dreams are often focussed on just body parts. Last time it was just a woman‚Äôs torso from behind and below the waist. These aren‚Äôt humans but objects. I feel like it‚Äôs an expression of a disjointed fixation on sexual body parts. I want to view women as whole beings and not just sums of their T and A and other sexual parts. 

I will pray for help against these spiritual assaults.

650^EarlyFlan^black^It‚Äôs a little ironic because ‚Äúnazi‚Äù was a term created to disparage national socialists. That lady is probably not a national socialist. The national socialists had no real qualm with the black man to my knowledge and actually treated visiting black American athletes like minor celebrities afaik. It‚Äôs hard to tell what is true and not because the history is put through the wash to serve curent ruling interests. I can be almost certain 6 million Jews did not perish in gas chambers or masturbation death machines, though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
651^isnortshrooms^opiates^No that's not how it works at all. That's a massive myth. Benzos and uppers are perfectly fine to mix, and so are opiates to an extent. It's because people who shoot heroin and coke together (a speedball) would drop dead often cause the coke would wear off and they OD on heroin.

651^isnortshrooms^opiates^because anti histamines are addictive on their own and are heavenly when combined with opiates

651^isnortshrooms^black^Probably an hour or 2 ish. Its not nearly as major as lsd tolerance tho. You can also take a tablespoon of tumeric with a teaspoon of black pepper as it provides mild maoi effects and that can push you to where you want to be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
652^missaudrey324^opiate^I‚Äôm so proud of you! I began on my road to opiate addiction about a year ago.. I now am 32 days sober for the first time since my addiction started and attend NA meetings 3x a week without fail. I‚Äôve met so many supportive and amazing people who‚Äôve helped me in my journey to recovery! Don‚Äôt give up you‚Äôre doing amazing! I promise you it‚Äôll all be worth it! Addiction is something we have to learn to cope and live with the rest of our lives but we can always make the best of it and take things one day at a time <3

652^missaudrey324^opioid^Hey hun I‚Äôve actually switched onto methadone and since I‚Äôve been on a 67mg dose I‚Äôve been having significant side effects that include insomnia, fatigue, exhaustion, anxiety, restlessness, constipation, occasional numbness and tingling to lower extremeties üò™üôà the doctor ordered some bloodwork to check my iron and thyroid levels and CBC and is switching me to metadol-D which is a diff formulation of methadose that I‚Äôve been on! There‚Äôs also been research studies that show 30% of people on opioid maintenance therapy can develop sleep apnea! So I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. But over 6 years sober and still have side effects? It may be something your body has developed overtime itself! Yes, you‚Äôre right PAWS does only last up to 2-3 months!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
653^CBANDS_313^opiates^I‚Äôm gonna be honest, Fentanyl. That shit doesn‚Äôt pop for opiates in my very recent experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
654^christrage^toys^Ok but I havnt seen any heaven yet. A room full of flashy toys and playmates to distract from getting taken away by creatures to be stored alive into coffins doesn‚Äôt seem like a  heaven.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
655^oxxxygen610^opiates^Seriously man... This sounds very bad and your life is invaluable. This exact same thing happened to me except I nodded off and normally I can fight the nod but this time I couldn't but luckily I woke up is when I realized I had to stop that my life was worth it. This shit has u gripped bro. If this didn't shake u up idk what will. It's time to stop fucking wake up. So many people love you and ofc we all love opiates but it's time for a break. I've been there. Done that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
656^Busted_Doe^opiates^I once heard something very interesting from my friends dad who used to be a Vicodin addicted ER doctor. He said ‚ÄúOpiates are the perfect drug for all kinds of pain (including emotional) if it wasn‚Äôt for tolerance and withdrawl.‚Äù

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
657^gljackson29^opiate^I am a recovering opiate addict, and I‚Äôm even on the same kind of medication Shannon‚Äôs on. But what she‚Äôs not understanding is that just because she‚Äôs not been using doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs healthy- her impulsive actions and overly emotional outbursts tell me that she‚Äôs not putting the ‚Äúwork‚Äù into her recovery. She‚Äôs still acting like an addict, just doing it sober. I think AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) calls it a ‚Äúdry drunk‚Äù.

657^gljackson29^opiates^I lost my father to suicide five years ago this month. I‚Äôm not gonna lie to you- I totally went off the deep end, turning my previously bad addiction to opiates to one that almost took my life. The day my father died was the same day I started shooting up- if I hadn‚Äôt gotten locked up a year and half later, I would surely be dead by now.

I have two and a half years clean, and one of the main things that keeps me that way is knowing that I have probably made my father proud. I‚Äôm sure that your father would want the same kind of life for you- and I promise you that your grief will only be that much worse if you use. You think it will deaden it, but when it does hit you it‚Äôs gonna be tenfold. Feel it now, go ahead and process it. We are supposed to feel things, good and bad.

Distract yourself, do yoga, do whatever you need to do to keep from picking up. We are here for you. And if you need to talk please don‚Äôt hesitate to message me. Praying for you both and much love. ‚ù§Ô∏è

657^gljackson29^opioid^Ok, I was just curious. I know that Shannon takes the same meds I do, and they‚Äôre for opioid dependence. The opioid epidemic is a problem pretty much everywhere, but up that way its really bad from my understanding. I‚Äôve just always kind of assumed (or figured) that his death was possibly drug-related. All the more reason she needs to tread carefully with all this medical mj and other drugs... I‚Äôm curious if she‚Äôs even been honest with her doctors about her family history of substance abuse...

657^gljackson29^black^If anyone has MaKayla‚Äôs live recorded please post it... she has deleted it from IG, and I totally missed it. 

She has got to stop using her kids as pawns to upset Calaen. If she doesn‚Äôt want to be with him, then fine. But don‚Äôt punish the kids. And the fact that she accused Calean of gaslighting is SERIOUSLY the pot calling the kettle black...

657^gljackson29^opiate^It is true that naloxone does block opiate receptors, but it‚Äôs only activated in the buprenorphine/naloxone combo if you try to inject it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
658^emerpuss29^opiates^thank you i always try! ill be mixing with opiates as soma potentiates it and i know its a dangerous mix but dont worry about me, my tolerance for opiates is dumb high but i havent touched h yet which i am super thankful for, just wasting my money on oxysü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

658^emerpuss29^opiates^enjoy the mix but be careful! i do the mix hc my tolerance is dumb high for opiates and benks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
659^Taurol^black^Nah I know what explains the mess and the fingerprints give it away. This person is a junkie. When you‚Äôre using cookers or even smoking Heroin you leave black soot marks all over. Light switches, door knobs, towels. To me, this explains the state of the car and the black fingerprints. Likely someone was living in the car for a period of time as well or just used it as their place to get high in private. Either way it would make sense to me, only would know if I saw the person.

659^Taurol^opium^Sorry but you‚Äôre actually functionally retarded if you were taking narcotic drugs and not expecting to become addicted/ form a habit. Not saying you are, but everyone who argues they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know the pills were addictive‚Äù or ‚Äúweren‚Äôt told‚Äù. 

Anything produced from the Opium poppy is gonna be wildly addictive. Everyone knew as soon as they made them Oxy would be dangerous. Did they care? No. But people should do their own research as to what they‚Äôre putting into their body. Not just blindly shovel Percocet and lortabs down their throat and ‚Äúoh shit I got addicted how could the doctors not tell me this would happen!‚Äù

Heroin was the ‚Äúnon addictive‚Äù response to morphine. Morphine the ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù for laudanum addiction. And laudanum, hailed as an elixir of the future; One that could cure those addicted to opium smoking. 

Funny how things come full circle once we start to look into these substances ourselves.

659^Taurol^black^I tried looking around but can‚Äôt find the article because of the huge amounts of content written daily about him and this was like way when he first launched his campaign I read it. They also were talking about how his sexuality would be a barrier towards black voters. Different things like that

If someone has a link that‚Äôd be dank, or if anyone knows people from south bend, holla.

659^Taurol^opiates^Nah homie, I backpack and camp a bunch. I‚Äôm very active and run, bike, and swim. I live in a pretty temperate area so there‚Äôs no real time I can‚Äôt go do outdoor activities.

I honestly honestly think it slows the aging process down. You gotta realize opiates in their pure form, are not harmful to your body. They‚Äôre one of the few exceptions of drugs. It‚Äôs the cuts and the adverse side effects (infections, respiratory depression, other accidents) that cause heroin related deaths. They‚Äôre not neurotoxic like most stimulants. They do not cause organ toxicity and the withdrawal cannot kill you. (Dehydration, depression/ suicide are more likely to kill you during them) technically if you had an unlimited supply of pure opiates, if you were extremely careful, you could probably use opiates indefinitely for you‚Äôre whole life and experience few health problems from the drug use.

659^Taurol^opiate^Yeah but that‚Äôs not a toxicity thing, it‚Äôs a physical reaction. Respiratory depression is why people die when they OD. Narcan only wakes you up enough to breath and then get you to a hospital, so you don‚Äôt die on the street. If you don‚Äôt get to the doctor immediately you will end up falling out again. I mean directly toxic, like alcohol will be directly toxic. And over time will destroy your organs. If you abuse opiates for 30 years and never have an OD (ie you don‚Äôt do enough to cause your breathing to stop) it‚Äôs not gonna cause your heart to give out one day. But, it‚Äôs the cuts in the drugs, infections, and like you said overdoses, that are causing deaths. While pure cocaine WILL kill you. Pure alcohol, will kill you.

And besides tolerance is funny, what would cause respiratory depression/ death in someone who is opiate naive would probably barely get me high. 

And vice versa what it takes to get me high, would kill like one or two people if they‚Äôd never done heroin.

659^Taurol^opiates^They always say before you start to IV, that opiates keep you young. If you‚Äôre able to keep your hygiene up, it slows everything down, I dunno about a cellular level but, definitely slows down all your normal bodily processes.

I‚Äôve known lots of addicts, myself included. Lots of my friends (especially girls) who are in their 30s look like they‚Äôre in their 20s still. Dunno why

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
660^crumblebunny^opiates^There is some irony here given that he's on opiates, but he's very paranoid about what marijuana might do to him but I think it's bad enough now that he'll give it a shot. Do CBD oils work or do you actually need the THC?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
661^ziplocfullacock^opiates^I fucking hate nodding and I can‚Äôt be the only one.  For me, nodding on dope (or Opiates in general) means you‚Äôve gone slightly too far and now you have to spend your whole high fighting off sleep otherwise you‚Äôll sleep through it and you‚Äôll likely not remember that high anyways.  Mega gay.  I prefer to hit that magical sweet spot where you feel like you‚Äôre cumming rainbows for six hours, you have the energy and strength to beat up and prison rape Goliath, and there‚Äôs literally nothing in the world you can‚Äôt do.  That‚Äôs the whole point to me, but maybe I‚Äôm just turbo weird.

661^ziplocfullacock^opiates^I feel you my man, just got out in the beginning of the month.  Opiates, Cocaine, and Meth.  In a partial right now.  Longest clean time I‚Äôve had in over a decade.

661^ziplocfullacock^black^I‚Äôm in group in a halfway house where I‚Äôm not even supposed to have my cellphone so I can‚Äôt go fiddle fucking around on YouTube, but it‚Äôs YouTube man, just search for ‚Äúhow to smoke black tar‚Äù or some shit like that.

661^ziplocfullacock^opiate^Medicare Part D data is public (not the names of the patients but the names of the meds prescribed by the doctors) and is available in malleable form.  When I last got a script I pulled all of the previous year‚Äôs data for my city, put together a data array of all doctors and the scripts they wrote.  Did a stacked sort of first by doctor and then by medication (removing all unnecessary medications).  I then found the doctors with the specialty I needed (pain management) who had written the most overall Opiate scripts (particularly of the Oxy assortment) and hit them up.  Worked like a top for me and all it took was some publicly accessible data and some middle school level data parsing skills.

I just actually found the data (I believe, have to hide my phone where I‚Äôm at so I‚Äôm rushing) so check this out for reference and to get started:

https://data.cms.gov/part-d-prescriber

661^ziplocfullacock^opiates^I don‚Äôt know how to say this, but I‚Äôm kind of a big deal.  You‚Äôre in every big rap and pop song, but you spend your time fiddle fucking around on the Reddit Opiates sub?  Get the fuck out of here.

661^ziplocfullacock^opiates^This isn‚Äôt really a speedball, it‚Äôs doing a fairly low amount of week Opiates in relative proximity to a low amount of Cocaine.  You‚Äôll be fine.

True speedballing is taking Cocaine, Heroin, and water, mixing it up in a spoon, drawing that bitch up in a needle, and banging it in your body (preferably your neck if you want to be a pro).  And to answer your question, it‚Äôs not safe at all, far from it, the best things in life rarely are.

661^ziplocfullacock^opiates^Glad you stayed with us!

Reddit pro-tip my man: when you‚Äôre tagging a user like you tagged Chase in your post, you use the ‚Äúu‚Äù tag, not the ‚Äúr‚Äù tag.  The ‚Äúr‚Äù tag is for subreddits (e.g., if you were linking to this sub you‚Äôd ‚Äúr‚Äù tag ‚ÄúOpiates‚Äù) and the ‚Äúu‚Äù tag is for users.

661^ziplocfullacock^opiate^Don‚Äôt listen to this dude, he has no idea what the fuck he‚Äôs talking about (as he has proven multiple times in the past few days on this sub).  If you are completely Opiate naive (i.e., you haven‚Äôt used Opiates prior and have no tolerance) 2-3 may honestly get you buzzed or even get you smacked.  5, in such a case, may push you to the point of nausea and puking (nausea is extremely common with Opiates, especially with those who are Opiate naive).  I‚Äôd say start with 2-3, 3 probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt you, then wait about 15-30 minutes.  If you are Opiate naive as it seems you are, you should feel a warming buzz and euphoria.  See where you‚Äôre at after 15-30 minutes and if it hasn‚Äôt produced the desired effect (or not enough of it) layer on another 1-2.  Then repeat this cycle until you‚Äôre at where you want to be.

Good luck!

661^ziplocfullacock^black^Just to clear this up from my other comment, since it seems like a lot of folks don‚Äôt know this, Afghan Heroin doesn‚Äôt really appear in the US anymore, mostly just the EU, UK, and Asia.  It is almost always brown and almost always #3, Heroin base.

Tar is pretty exclusive to the US as it‚Äôs almost exclusively made in Mexico as its garbage.  It‚Äôs the result of poor and incomplete processing/refinement.  The brown #4 in the US is primarily from Colombia with a small portion produced in Mexico.  White ‚ÄúHeroin‚Äù in the US is almost always Fentanyl or a Fentanyl analogue.

This is because the only area that produces truly pure white (really off white) Heroin that is actual Heroin is SEA (mostly Thailand and the Shan state).  Most of that Heroin stays in Asia with some of it making it to the rest of the world, oddly enough the primary destination being Canada.

...and there you have it.  That is how the origins of today‚Äôs Heroin breakdown.  If you‚Äôre asking what people like better between the American options you‚Äôre really asking about Mexican BTH (brown or black tar), Colombian #4 (brown), or synthetic Canadian or Mexican #4 (white and grey).

661^ziplocfullacock^opiate^I‚Äôve heard 24/25, but everyone is different.  I‚Äôm mega against Vivitrol to be honest.  I have a turbo bad reaction to Naltrexone: ultra depression, maximum malaise, and general not-giving-a-fuck-edness.

From those I‚Äôve heard who‚Äôve used it ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù, though, somewhere between day 20 and day 25 they describe the exact same feeling: they can literally feel it wearing off and they often tell me that they get the worst cravings they‚Äôve ever had (seemingly worse than before they got the shot oddly enough).  I‚Äôve had a few friends actually die because they were on Naltrexone, they hit day 20-25, they got turbo cravings and then, rather than getting a new shot, they went the fuck it route, banged a mud shot, their tolerance had dropped to nothing, and they ended up cold slabbed and toe tagged.

I honestly believe that if you‚Äôre going to use MAT (or recommend MAT for that matter) it should be a MAT solution that actually addresses the craving directly and on a regular (preferably daily) basis.  Since diacetylmorphine isn‚Äôt available for MAT anymore in most of the world, that leaves Methadone and Suboxone.  I honestly believe Methadone is a trap and most Methadone users would be better off with Heroin, but Suboxone actually seems like a very strong and reasonable approach.  I‚Äôm on it now and doing well and, while I haven‚Äôt been on it long, I was on it before successfully for over a year.  I not only lived a productive and socially acceptable life, I didn‚Äôt use illicitly, and I was able to taper off without withdrawals (literally the only Opiate I‚Äôve ever been able to taper).

661^ziplocfullacock^china^They weren‚Äôt invented in Canada you dolt, they were dyed in Canada so people could tell the difference between the different Fentanyl analogues.  Fentanyl is produced in Canada because it is easy to get the precursors there from China.  It is not always cut with Caffeine either.

China White isn‚Äôt a term exclusive to Canada, though.  It existed long before Canada had Fent, long before Fent was on the scene.  It was originally used to describe pure Heroin which is white...such Heroin only really comes from SEA thus the China bit.

Anyone on here will tell you I know a fuckton more about Fent, Fent analogues, and Heroin in general than you can ever hope to so stop giving out bad information and go back to sipping your lean.

661^ziplocfullacock^opium^Yes, almost definitely from Mexico.  Almost all tar comes from Mexico.  Tar is a crappier product than #3 or #4 as tar is the result of an incomplete refinement process.  As a result, black tar typically maxes out at 30% Heroin which is why I was saying it is inherently not fire.

Afghan dope, while Afghanistan produces somewhere between 60-70% of the world‚Äôs Opium, is very VERY rarely seen outside of Asia and Europe.  It is just about the only thing you‚Äôll find in the UK and EU, but finding it in the US is rarer than finding a sober hobo.  Additionally, Afghani Opium is refined into Heroin in a handful of places, primarily Pakistan.  Almost all of the Afghani Opium that is refined into Heroin is turned into Heroin base (#3).  I don‚Äôt like speaking in absolutes as one never knows, but I can fairly confidently say that NONE of Afghani Opium is turned into BTH.

All that comes together into forming my point that just by reading the post and seeing the picture, rather safely inferring that OP is in the US and acquired BTH of some variety, it is almost certainly neither bang dope nor Afghani which is to say the original commenter has no fucking clue what he‚Äôs talking about.  Unfortunately that seems to be an epidemic on this sub these days, though...

662^prometheusco6987^opiate^Where have you been the last 5 years? Opiate epidemic due to fent pressed ? Dance safe.com sells test stipend. It‚Äôs recommended you test The Whole Pool but no one dissolves their entire pill

662^prometheusco6987^opiates^Well technically yes that‚Äôs why you tested it... but like i said not everyone does the whole pill but it‚Äôs recommended since one side of the pill may be clean and the other a hot spot. By the sound of you being so unsure I‚Äôd stay away from opiates . It‚Äôll get very dangerous

662^prometheusco6987^opiate^They kill you when you nod off and go to sleep while using. Your body basically ‚Äúforgets‚Äù how to breath . That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs recommended not to sleep after using until you feel safe .  The reason you od was the benzo and opiate combo idk if the caffeine had anything to do with it.   This happened to me with oxy and muscle relaxers

662^prometheusco6987^opiate^Opiates are highly addictive and is very dangerous especially now with all the presses pills going around . First thing is to get him/her fentanyl test strips that can be found on dance safe.com . Second is to see exactly what opiate is being used Percocet or oxy . Percocet has Tylenol in it while oxy doesn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs stronger and more addictive .   Then I‚Äôd try to get them to slowly taper off and eventually quit which may be hard since it sounds like they already have a liking to them but the addiction will only grow and they will find them self needing more and more to try to reach the same feeling as when they first started

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
663^oneyearthrowaway617^opiates^For me, the answer is yes. I think I've found a way to live a happy life. I'm a better person, a better son, friend, husband and father. I'm better in every single way possible since getting clean.

My life when I was using was shit. I'd get up and get high. I'd live my life two hours at a time while I struggled, watching the clock until I could get high again. I had no money, no friends, and my future was looking darker and darker by the day. I genuinely didn't care if I lived or died by the end of it all. I used to pray at night that I'd just slip away in my sleep. Death felt be easier than climbing out of the hole I dug for myself. The shame I felt was suffocating. In the end I just couldn't take it anymore. I didn't have the balls to kill myself and I had no more money for drugs, so I said fuck it and I went to rehab.

3.5 years later and I'm a totally different person. The truth is really that I'm simply the person I was always meant to be before drugs fucked it all up. Since getting clean I got married, had a baby and I've been promoted a couple times at work. I make enough money now that my wife gets to stay at home with our baby. By all accounts, I live an incredible life now. I take vacations, weekend trips, and I basically do whatever I want because I'm not a slave to opiates anymore. 

If there's something in your head telling you that your life is better with drugs, you're an addict and your brain is lying to you. It's nothing new, anyone on this subreddit with considerable time clean will tell you the same thing. You're brain is hi-jacked by drugs. Give yourself some time to get clean and get your mind clear. The longer you stay clean, the clearer things get, both about your past and your future. Good luck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
664^Stressed_Deserts^opiates^The other poster is a fucking idiot using scare tactics.  You really should consult a doctor and there have been plenty of healthy babies born when (Edit my wife) went cold turkey as soon as she found out. Example my wife we have a wonderful set of 9 year old twins doing completely fine, also a 4 year old both times she was either on subs or opiates and went cold turkey. We also have a 2 year old where they recommended she stay on the subs the whole time. Really talk to a doctor get pre natal care and don't worry about some internet crusader trying to scare people because they have low self esteem or insane religious beliefs or they are plain fucking dumb.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
665^___PaSta___^opiates^Not really why people take acid tbh. I guess it's different for everyone, but Iv never dropped acid to feel good... In fact it's always pretty uncomfortable, even if it's worth  it overall. If you wanted to feel good, you would take opiates and mdma.

665^___PaSta___^black^Still, dont you think it's unrealistic to make the legal age 25? It would just lead to the black market for weed continuing, which defeats the whole point of legalisation. The biggest market is for people aged 20-25. Also brain development is different for different people... Some people dont finish brain development until 30... Should we make the age 30 to protect those people? I feel like once you are an adult, you should be responsible for your own dumb decisions and no government should get to say what someone may or may not consume.

665^___PaSta___^china^Outbreak was in China... Anyone who pretends to know how many people are infected are silly. If you think for a second China wouldnt try to hide how severe the situation is, you are naive. When a chemical Explosion kills thousands, they pretend 40 people died.

665^___PaSta___^opiates^Yeah just like with other opiates, pissing becomes harder on kratom. Not a big deal though and still easier than pissing on morphine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
666^Superb-Tale^opiate^Wont get worse, you‚Äôll just prolong how long you have to WD in general tho. Every second you‚Äôre not on an opiate, your tolerance will go down.

From everyday use of heroin, I slowly spaced it out to every other day, then eventually week, then two weeks, a year eventually passed where I didn‚Äôt WD since my last use and felt fine for a month.

Then hell broke loose again. Lol

666^Superb-Tale^opiates^Dude my last time using was a score I made in my home city known very well as the murder capitol.

Got off a plane there to see family and scored at 3 am with a friend and then a living nightmare happened. I threw up over 40 times in just 12 hours, the puking having started only ten minutes after I SNORTED A HALF OF A LINE. I started choking on my vomit, lying between a wall and a toilet, was completely unable to breathe. I was certain I was gonna die. After my vision started to fade, my throat loosened up and I rolled over and vomited an enormous pile of blood.

I got in my car and blew my dad‚Äôs phone up, telling him I needed to get to inpatient immediately and so I drove ten and a half hours back to my dad‚Äôs in the state of eternal sunshine. After nodding out at the wheel and almost crashing at least a dozen times, I miraculously made it home and got into treatment. I took a drug screen and blood test, absolutely nothing showed up, not even opiates. They later came and told me I had used pure fentanyl and that the amount was enough to kill a decent sized animal.

Currently over 4 mo‚Äôs clean, but... I‚Äôve been working on changing that. I just want some normal black and I‚Äôll be happy but I‚Äôm too big of a wuss to cold cop, so, we‚Äôll see.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
667^nothnkyou^china^Eh pretty sure they don‚Äôt have proper access and you‚Äôre just hard into us propaganda. Also you calling me reddit educated when I‚Äôm clearly going against the grain and ‚ÄòChina bad‚Äô is one of the most popular opinion on the internet is just weird. 
Like please compare health care problems/debt or avoidance of getting help to germany from example. Having the ‚Äòbest‚Äô xy doesn‚Äôt count anything if people can‚Äôt pay or will kill themselves because of the debt

667^nothnkyou^china^It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not as bad in other countries. No other countries lack health care so much. Not other countries have this much violence. No other countries invade other countries so often. The us are the worst human rights abusers & China is one of the good countries, fighting the damage the us is doing. 
Have fun eating your propaganda

667^nothnkyou^china^Yea I know, just all the people hating on China 24/7 while acting as if the US would be more humane are smart. China jails people so unfairly (small prison pop, but still against human rights) while the Us jails people really fairly and makes a profit while doing so (biggest prison pop ever in history & very human rights friendly).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
668^lDommm^opiates^Thanks for the advice. I've been thinking about it nonstop since I realised what caused me to feel that way. I have seen first hand, the destruction that opiates can cause to someone's life so I am going to stay well away, although I admit I am very tempted.

-after the split between Anarchists and Marxists in 1872

669^WednesdaysEye^dreams^I agree that unfortunately it is naive to think it is possible to achieve without bloodshed. It doesn't mean we ( well I hope I speak for the majority of us) wouldnt rather it be a peaceful transition done by the people realizing they have nothing to lose but their chains.  However it would be somewhat conceivable that once it is established that we the people are ready to lives without rulers, that we could tactically get rid of the people with enough power and wealth to fight for keeping it. We have learned that if the bourgeoisie is left untouched it will find a way to reclaim power. For example, they could hire private armies from other countries. Although it is the easiest path, I would rather not become what we fight against and just murder these people. Would prefer just putting them in chains so they can get a taste of what they have been doing to the rest of us. And eventualy freeing them, making sure they have no more power or wealth to trample the freedom of others. But again tactically speaking, discreet hit squads simultaneously getting rid of the small amount of people that will never let us live outside of their control, would be the minimal bloodshed approach.
Just my two cents.
Also an important factor would be the armies keeping their contract with society and siding with the people against a tyrannical government. Without their armies they have no power, and if the guns and trained soldiers are on the side of liberation then that would be a strong enough show of force to destroy the dreams of the rulers to maintain any amount of control.

669^WednesdaysEye^black^Revolutionary left radio podcast has a great one on this subject. Showing you why the numbers in the black book of communism are bullshit. They count unborn babies. They even count the nazis they killed. I mean comon. They count people who died of old age during communism.

670^hulkhoganblue^opiates^It absolutely can be a lifesaver, but it‚Äôs caused issues for me in the past. Back in highschool before I could find real opiates I was taking 30+ grams a day and feeling disgusted with myself

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

672^KoneyIsland^dreams^Been clean for 10ish months now and get these dreams every so often. 

Not once have I ever been able to do the dope in my dreams, always wake up right after copping or right before sniffing/banging. 

It's frustrating as hell lmao

672^KoneyIsland^opiate^That guy is wrong. If you are completely opiate naive, it takes about 2-3 weeks of regular use to develop a physical dependence. 

However, if you have used opiates on a regular/daily basis before or if you were physically dependent, then it only takes about 3-5 days

672^KoneyIsland^opiates^Like 2-3 weeks for someone that's never done opiates before. 

But it sounds like you've used before and those pesky neurons remember the good ol days real fast. Golden rule is 2 days on atleast 3 days off to keep the sickness at bay

672^KoneyIsland^opiate^If you're opiate naive, tolerance usually takes a few weeks to build up to a noticeable level. 

I wouldn't be worried about 3 days in a row taking 12.5mg of oxy

673^DR0PPA^opioid^Man this NYE i spent the first 4 hours of 2020 in the hospital with an IV in my neck cuz its the only place they could go, with my left hand bigger than a balloon and infected like a motherfucker...


Seeing how ripped and stained (from injecting in arteries accidentally... the stains last 6mo+ sometimes even years like on my hands )
My arms and hands looked, and watching my girl have to look at me with an IV in my neck all helpless? 

I broke down to my mom for the first time in a LONG time - just cuz iv my addiction pretty controlled for a long time.. but i went back to chicago for just a week and it was more than enough time to blow out ALLL remaining veins I had and catch an infection from the dirty ass (but FIRE) dope /: 

Really depressing shit - I didnt realize how the tracks and body mutilation side-effects are really what upset me the most about my addiction besides sacrificing a healthy sex life for drugs for almost a decade...


I just prayed and asked to get a healthy and phenomenal sex life back over any anount of drugs in the world... and that i‚Äôd do anything to acheive it..

It really is one of the most depressing situations to be in as a man...

Having no sex drive and having problems with your dick from long-term opioid abuse, low Testosterone levels and difficulty keeping wood...

It REALLLY fucks up your sense of masculinity and as a result can develop complexes about your sexuality..

Ahem ‚úãüèΩ me

Good luck man. Sending good energy your way

673^DR0PPA^opiates^I‚Äôm passionate about making a genre of music that empowers dope-fiends and addicts -

I call it ‚ÄúHeroin-Trap‚Äù -

I used to be passionate about drugs to the point where I stopped playing all music ..

(guitar drums vocals? You name it - left in the dirt)

I had to slowly but surely fall out of love with the process of DOING & OBTAINING drugs... 

I will always be passionate about drugs - namely opiates - but I have to switch into a mindset where I‚Äôm passionate about helping fellow addicts who are questioning if they‚Äôll ever truly be able to get clean (like me)

673^DR0PPA^opiates^I suppose I should be thankful I can still ‚Äúperform‚Äù just about every other night...

And iMm lucky to have a girl who doesn‚Äôt make me feel self-conscious about my sex issues from opiates and she doesn‚Äôt make me feel like less of a man... i‚Äôm very lucky in that regard..

But she wants it ALL the time!! And I simply don‚Äôt ... so that gets old really fast.. and I know she cant help it cuz lord knows when i get clean/on subs? i have to literally cum 4x a night..

I actually developed a bit of a problem last time i got clean where I would stay up til like 4am every night Edging myself for like 2-3hours -_- it was absolutely fucking ridiculous at that point..
Just losing sleep for cumming ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tell me what ya think

And believe it or not, weed used to kind of take away from the sensation of the opiods for me, but if you‚Äôre opioid naive , weed and opiates will feel like you went up to meet god himself and received a kiss üíã

674^kollaps3^dreams^Aww these are adorable you had the liberty spikes of my 14 year old dreams! You look like one of the girls I'd see at a show back in 07 and be sooo intimidated by but also wanna be best friends with üòÇ also from one punk lady to another you are GORGEOUS

674^kollaps3^opiate^Holy shit a lot of your situation sounds really similar to mine. My man and I also got clean together and we had tried many times before and it never worked but we have both been on suboxone as prescribed and dope free for nearly 10 months now. We also live in the same neighborhood as our old dealer, in fact we live in the opiate capital of our country, but we also were the kind of junkies who could sniff out dope in like a small town in the mountains so we kind of realized the place isn't gonna matter, there's always gonna be dope on almost every corner and baggies all over the subway stations so it's more about completely shifting your attitude until you just no longer see opiates as an option, ever. Sounds insanely difficult I know but if my bundle a day shooting ass can do it I know you got this too üíú

You sound like your head is really in the right place and it's so difficult to stay away from using when life is throwing all these problems out of your control at you and you just have the urge to slap the band aid of dope on it but through acceptance, exactly what you said, you can get through it. Im so proud of you girl getting to nearly a week is amazing! I totally know what you mean about the cooking breakfast and doing fun sober people shit, it's so nice to be able to appreciate those little things again. Im so glad this sub has been able to be of such help to you; my first few months clean this place was basically my version of going to meetings every day lol. Much love to you and keep it up!!

674^kollaps3^black^Morning y'all! I've been slacking hard on making check ins and/or stickying them among other minor stuff and I gotta be better about that im sorry üò£ this might be a long one but let me try and make it shorter.  

A few pertinent things:  

1. R has somehow become way more aware of and better with his behavior and overall demeanor. He said this to me last night, almost word for word, after I reacted to him being annoyed about something that had nothing to do with me by instantly apologizing: "you should never have to feel that way, you shouldn't have to thank me for treating you nicely or not freaking out on you, that should be the norm, and you shouldn't be constantly worried that things out of your control will make me angry and you'll be responsible for fixing them for me because that's not your problem and I shouldn't make it your problem, and I'm sorry for making it that way in the past,I promise i will do better in the future".  

 Of course I can't fully believe him Cuz I don't fully believe anyone when they tell me they're going to do something, but he's been staying true to his word. The other night he came home really angry about some shit he had 100% every right to be angry about, in fact I was furious FOR him, but the kicker was he didn't take it out on me at all, he actually vented TO me not AT me. Afterwards I told him how much I appreciate him not getting angry at me and he got really ashamed and said that I shouldn't have to appreciate it, that should just be what always goes on. Makes me realize how fucked up my head really is in terms of relationships, that bare minimum respectful treatment that normal people require as a baseline from their partner seems to me like some special extra nice behavior.  

2. Some fucking person took all of my appt slots with my therapist for the next two months and I know that 90%of the ppl that go there are unemployed so I'm betting its some fucker who has other options while for me that is literally the only time that will work with my schedule and I really do not know what to do im kind of freaked out and pissed off it's kind of like the clean version of my dealer being out of town for two months or some shit lmao but for real im pissed idfk what im gonna do.  

3. So for years and years my favorite music was black metal but around 2017 when I started getting really badly strung out I stopped listening to it for the most part and barely have since then. But the other day after reading my old journal it reminded me of this one song I used to really love so I went to listen to it and from there it was just like the flood gates of 3 years of not listening to my favorite music just opened and holy shit it was just an amazing feeling. I feel like it helps remind me of myself before I ever got strung out and before I put myself in truly miserable, dangerous situations, and it just makes me feel less numb.  

Ight imma wrap this shit up now lol that was about as brief as it was gonna get considering all the shit that's been on my mind lately. Im at school rn got my first class in like 40 min, I got my rag while I was at work yesterday and last night had miserable cramps that woke me up out of sleep but I'm feeling at least good enough to get out of bed today and my rule is if I have the strength to leave my bed, no matter how shitty I may feel otherwise, then I have the strength to go about my day. Really not having it mentally today though lol I actually like talk to kids in class this semester but today I really don't wanna have none of that lol. Well love you guys always grateful for this space and y'all putting up with me running my mouth, hope everyone has a good Thursday! üíú

674^kollaps3^opiates^I started hanging out in the punk scene at a very young age in my city (nyc). Also grew up hearing stories of the London punk scene from my mom. Read a bunch of books and stuff about it starting from like age 10, all of which had heavy mentions of heroin use, before I even started going to shows at age 13ish. So I was curious about heroin from the time I was literally a child.  

 Saw a lot of my older friends use during my young teenage years and while I would fuck w prescription opiates every now and then (and loved every minute of it) I already knew deep down that as soon as I touched heroin it would become a huge problem for me. At age 15-17 I went thru two abusive relationships back to back, the second with a recovering addict 9 years my senior. That shit really tore me up inside and when I moved from the west coast where I was living with him back to nyc right before I turned 18, the minute I had an opportunity to do dope (which was pretty soon, considering how many of my friends used) I did it.  

 I rode freight trains around north America for a few years after that and got strung out in a few different cities, the worst of it in Vancouver bc. All that time I was still only snorting. At age 19 i got clean no MAT and stayed completely clean (i drank and smoked weed but no hard drugs) for a little over two years. In that time i got into, surprise surprise, another abusive relationship, and this one was really really bad. Towards the end of it I started using weekly, then after we broke up I got with my current boyfriend who was a very bad addict and that's when i started shooting it. That, as we know, is a whole different ball game.  

A lot of awful things had happened in my life and for 2+ years all I did was shoot up about it. My life was in fucking ruins and I was homeless for a lot of this time. Ended up getting my shit together april 2019 and despite it being like the 20th time trying suboxone it actually worked for me that time. The 18th of this month I'll be 9 months clean, I'm on 12mg sub/day and smoke weed before I go to bed but that's it. My boyfriend, who had a really rough upbringing and was strung out for the better part of the last decade, has also been completely clean since April.  

 I still follow this sub Cuz I'm really devoted to harm reduction and helping out my fellow junkies Cuz just because I'm clean doesn't mean I'm gonna leave those that could use my (or anyone's) help or support behind Cuz it's ~triggering~ to me or some shit. Heroin was such a constant shadow over my shoulder, even before I ever used, for a good decade of my life. A little while ago I found a diary entry from age 12 saying as much as I didn't want it to be true and knew all the dangers I knew I would do dope one day. Shit is crazy but I'm just so grateful to be free of it. I have a job I like and am currently in school working towards my degree which I never thought would happen. Can't get complacent Cuz the demon is always just over your shoulder but I'm happy and grateful to be where I'm at now.

675^cozywarmedblanket^opiates^Hard opiates changes weed forever for me.  Well, my life isn't over so forever is not a good word but since then it's never been the same.  Used to smoke 10 dabs a day.

675^cozywarmedblanket^opiates^When I was on full agonists, I developed myoclonic jerks - it freaked me out but it's actually very normal for opiates.  Haven't had it with subs tho.

675^cozywarmedblanket^opiate^Thank you for your female input!  Love the comment.  I'd guild it if I had extra money to do so right now.  I know my doctor deals with females who have been on long term opiate use and helps them with their hormones, but I never asked or thought about asking until now.

Edit: totally agree that it's VERY hard to find a good endo (or good doctor in general).

675^cozywarmedblanket^opiates^I mean, yes and no.  Opiates by definition are one of the least harmful drugs for your body, if you don't od.  However, if you don't have chronic pain, and you aren't just plagued by cravings (prob need to get therapy and hormone stuff), then you're right that people shouldn't take meds they don't need.  It's hard though.  We know so little.

675^cozywarmedblanket^opiates^Oh, yeah, there's lots of other reasons for it, opiates are just one of many.  I learned to accept them too.  They are gone now that I'm off full agonists.

675^cozywarmedblanket^opiate^I agree that the shot was made largely to cash in on the patent ending, and I don't disagree that, at first, a subs are a cash grab.  

I do think that it gives people back their life (although I think so would legalization and being able to go buy your drugs at a store for cheap), and if you look at the research, the partial agonist properties of bupe are legitimately a very good choice for pain pts - the chronicpain sub has stories that back up the very easily findable peer reviewed research.

I have met people who ended subs without wd, but they did it over the course of, like, two years.  It's not something you end in a few months, which a ton of people try to do.

My big defense of the shot is this; it sucks having to remember to take meds twice a day or once a day if you aren't used to it, and it sucks if you have an odd job that makes bringing it with you a risk.  I'd prefer a shot a month to a pill a day.

I have a friend in the medical field attempting to do the shot-taper deal herself very soon.  I'll report back.  For now, I'm going both agree and not agree.  I think you have to want to be done; partial agonist or not, subs are still an opiate.  I think the concept of a shot tapering is real, as I have experienced that on the hormone side.  I'm going to wait to comment again on the painlessness until after my friend finishes her treatment.

676^jrocnk2^china^Not anymore. China makes the precursors and ships them to Mexico and presumably other countries to be whipped up into fentalogues

676^jrocnk2^opium^Fentanyl has no bitter taste as it is not molecularly related to opiates derived from opium.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
677^Genji5683^opiates^She does want to quit the pressure i think is twisted in her head...like the price she gets I think she feels compensates for the stress and she can safely make enough to survive stay high and not have to do anything and shes never tried to be sober before so that scares her but yes I genuinely think she really WANTS to... I mean I say that with no sarcasm at all I think any of us who've actually quit for any point of time nose what it's like I made it just under a year before I fell back and I have no idea what is going to be like for her because with mine wanted help that I was incarcerated so I was forced to detox and withdraw I have no other option or temptation to tempt me also withdrawal from my DOC doesn't come with a physical withdrawal as well at least not in the same sense as opiates and I guess for clarification today's going to be the first day to actually set a taper dose originally we were just trying to go by feel can I see how far she can go in between peach butt the research wasn't very helpful because stress and everything else were other variables that were uncontrollable so decided to say fuck it and try a different approach no it's not being taken from her but she did ask that it be put somewhere she can't get to and have someone other than her control when and how much that's why I was asking for any advice because I have no idea I don't want to make her absolutely fucking miserable because she doesn't get enough but that made me think of something I have a question on a different approach...narcan... isn't that instant detox? I mean if I remember correctly the way she phrased it Narcan would be like a week's worth of withdrawal in 1 minute yes it's extremely painful and miserable but how long does it last and is it a quicker solution will it have any lasting effects? and the idea never and to my mind until she said it as a joke so I'm curious now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
678^addonustheXII^opiates^Yea alot of people dont realize what these drugs do. I'm sticking to what i know works, im sick of guinea pigging drugs that arent narcotics. atleast narcotics have a good rapport with effect. I use opiates and narcotics responsibly. im gonna try and get ketamine if i can from them for pain. well see

678^addonustheXII^opiates^im curious, i have bad cervical stenosis. could i talk to a pain management doctor and get the right opiates i need through the telephone?

678^addonustheXII^opiate^My thoughts exactly. Its crazy how people dont think about this or atleast aware of it? ive seen the "true" opiate crisis go down. docs overprescribe for no medical reasons , quit , then people turn to the street. No doubt it was planned

did anyone know the old guy from The price is right highly profited from the prison system from toiletries etc? The Prison system keeps so many people wealthy

678^addonustheXII^opiates^I would highly recommend it. It's better to be safe then sorry. Like I said, my blood pressure cuff saved my life a couple times. and that was without the use of opiates. It's good for anyone to keep track of their blood pressure. It should be promoted more for health but I dont know anyone with one tbh. Glad I have one though

678^addonustheXII^opiate^We need an ashton manual equivalence for opiate use. Very nice post!

Positive thinking and positive post. I like it

678^addonustheXII^opiates^whats dangerous is your BP droppiing to low. keep a blood pressure cuff handy. It's literally saved my life and allowed me to go to the hospital because of other health issues(high BP) , so this was without opiates. I was recently prescribed dilaudid and have zanaflex but my BP drops to low for me to feel comfortable taking it. Oxygen deprivation is felt, I have to knock my self out of it. It creates more nods and its very easy to die this way. I'm also tapering benzos. I'm at a low dose but it also contributes to BP dropping, so im very careful cause i don't want to die. but all of it contributes to BP dropping when mixing. So be very careful!

Get a blood pressure monitor and be safe.

678^addonustheXII^opiate^I feel ya man, i was prescribed a lot of xanax in the past and its tough. I never thought i'd get clean from them. I'm still tapering benzos... benzo withdrawal is so much worse then opiate. Best of luck friend, atleast your trying

678^addonustheXII^dreams^I wanna cry whenever i take it so its just not for me, I have zanaflex too.. ill probably just take that. it drops your BP so bad though. My minds tired so its just going crazy with recollections. I hate seeing people you used to know in your dreams. its so creepy. but there hellish dreams. I wouldnt even try explaining them...

678^addonustheXII^dreams^from the 1st night. I like gaba better but it quits working for me eventually and the withdrawal is horrible.

The nightmares are literally from hell. Creepiest shit and i can remember the dreams vividly.

679^lissawray^opiate^Wow. There is so much diversity in everyone's "knowledge" about pain and opiates to treat pain. My pain "eats" my opiate euphoria (ie. If I'm in an immense amount of pain I get zero euphoria from said dose, my euphoria is wholly in relief from the original pain). I do recognize the problems with opiates prescribed inappropriately which is how people obtain the "high" they get from opiates. 

I've broken both legs twice each with many other major injuries and on my 30th surgery with only palliative care as any expectation for the future. It is people like myself that are being thrown out with the bathwater in this epidemic. 8 feel for anyone suffering wds today though. Noone deserves that (well except these 2 folks I know...but that's another post for another day). Y'all be well.

679^lissawray^opiate^I‚Äôve been involved in 2 near fatal mva‚Äôs and broke both legs both times. I am mostly metal from the hips down and woefully under treated for an opiate naive individual. Had a procedure today they give most people versed for. I needed propofol for twilight sedation. Yes recreational users are setting themselves up for a very ugly reality if the worst does happen.

680^DrugXtraordinaire^opium^And thy mosteth noble peasant, shoved oral syringe so far uppeth thy asshole and boofed thy opium.

680^DrugXtraordinaire^opiates^Percocet is closer to heroin, you cant compare lean to heroin those are way too fuckin different lol. If you tried opiates you'd understand why people want em.

680^DrugXtraordinaire^opiate^The thing about the tar I did is that somewhere in the high, I felt like I had to try and breathe harder, even after only taking 12.5 and 25mg lines of cheese (gunpowder and sugar as cut). I came to the verdict that I was a pill guy and just didnt like heroin as much as oxy, but oxycodone is so expensive, you know how it is, and I wanna make sure heroin isn't my DOC in the opiates class before I shell out half a grand for oxycodone in bulk. Could have just got some shitty tar. The dude claimed it had 90% opiate alkaloids, morphine, codeine, and heroin mixed together for that 90%, so maybe too many drugs at once in that heroin if that was the case? Idk

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
681^yikesyikes666^opiates^Depends on your duration of use! I was heavy opiates for 5 years, got clean for 4 and a half, felt normal after about 3 months honestly.

I relapsed 4 months ago and wenr prettty hard,  now im 6 days clean and its a roller coaster of emotion :/

681^yikesyikes666^opiate^My methadone withdrawals were....months long. Better off switchin a shorter acting opiate and titrating, jumping off with the help of benzos and marjuana.

681^yikesyikes666^opiate^As long as it doesnt reduce my Recovery time of my opiate receptors and my natural serotonin and stuff, its ok with me!

681^yikesyikes666^opiates^Anything is better than being a slave to opiates or similars! 

Gotta be wary of benzos too, I have been using very small amounts of valium and etizolam here and there, making sure not to make a habbit out of it.

681^yikesyikes666^opiate^4 months of heavy IV quality H, several times a day...after beibg opiate free for 5 years.

681^yikesyikes666^opioid^I think you're 100% correct. Im just in the ups and downs of early opioid recovery and feeling alot of ups and downs.

681^yikesyikes666^opiate^My plan is just to wait and see if any symptoms present themselves. On day 4 or H withdrawal, took maybe 30 or so mg of methadone.  By my math anf half life of methadone, itll say in my system as the H completely gets expelled from my body.

My worry wss that by using any opiate, i would start from day 1 but it doesnt appear that way, thank god!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
682^anonymous316316^opiate^any product suggestions from chemicalplanet that would be similar to a gaba agonist (benzo), and any mu kappa or delta opioid receptor agonists (opiate analog)? seems like they have quite a bit of synthetic stims similar to that of teh white holy grail & also amphet.

682^anonymous316316^opiates^any tips...? ive quit the opiates. now im just trying to break the coke habit man....its hard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
683^mountmoo^opiates^It‚Äôs just an interesting chemical really. It‚Äôs approximately 500x stronger than morphine but the side effects that often occur with an overdose or someone who needs a high dose for pain relief are lessor than with classic opiates. If this was researched more way back when it was synthesized it could have possibly reduced OD deaths

683^mountmoo^opiate^I was thinking of maybe taking 1mg IV when/if I try it for the first time definitely not opiate naive but better safe than sorry since it‚Äôd be my first time using that method. I‚Äôve only sniffed H and it nearly fucked up my nose

683^mountmoo^opiates^Haha most I‚Äôve felt is minor sedation and very minor euphoria after taking 5g over the course of a night with alcohol. I guess to be fair to her I tried to abuse it but it‚Äôs not a drug with a high abuse profile. It can potentiate opiates tho

683^mountmoo^opiates^I agree tramadol sucks ass. It‚Äôs just all I can get for opiates until my chronic pain appointment on the 4th. Goes with the Xanax sort of well and Xanax increases the seizure barrier

683^mountmoo^black^I usually black out at 8mg ir but I think the xr gives you smaller doses over an extended period of time

683^mountmoo^opiates^^ I am a victim to scenario A however scenario B is why I‚Äôm very careful about taking opiates. I find the withdrawals from them way worse even though they can‚Äôt kill you

683^mountmoo^opiates^I feel like it‚Äôd make me throw up just from the rush of water. It makes me nauseas just thinking about it. You do you though. I‚Äôd probably sniff before I tried injecting.  Then I‚Äôd skip rectal and just go right to IV but if snuffing gets me higher than orally I will probably be fine sticking with it. I don‚Äôt tend to get too into opiates. Although might get another script soon because of how bad my back pain is. Just 2mg of the hydromorphone orally was so ineffective. Even for pain and I want to stretch out what ever I get as long as I can which means making lower doses more effective. Probably just an excuse to go down a slippery slope but fuck it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
684^robertkorozsi^opiate^Aww I viewed your profile. I thought You are against opioid use in the case like mine. i really have a lot of broken bones internal bleeding was stopped by surgery, bruised bladder, metal screws in my tibia. on ,y right hand radius and ulna is broken aswell 3 broken ribs a lot of contusions all over my body. The back of my scull had a fracture. And I am facing at least 3 months recovery. So like it hurts it fucking hurts even with this 10mg oxy I have some. But after I saw your profile correct me please if I got it wrong You are not against opiate use if it is unevitable. Like sufffer in pain or focus on your recovery.

684^robertkorozsi^opiates^Yes coke was my fiance at least in the "honemoon" phase. Now I get it that shit opiates are a way different territory. I am an addictive personality so I have to be really cautious now. And here you cant buy pills off the street. If I would abuse the hell out of these 30 pills and ,aybe got addicted than straight to heroine. So I keep it on the minimum and I hope that I under ,y fathers supervision get the best out of it.

BTW : I am still itchy as hell

684^robertkorozsi^opioid^Yes I totally agree with You. I was addicted to cocaine I used it for six years. The same reason " angry anxious depressed angry and introverted. I quit coke twoyears ago. Also I did not drink when using coke cause that keep me "in the line" all day. Woke up the first thing I did was a heavy line. And at the evening I coped with the comedown with overdosing benzos. Acruqlly I am still tapering off the Benzodiazepines. Coke was not that hard to stop it jist took a lot of time not to relapse.  Anyway this is the first time my body met with qn opioid. also at the hospital i am sire they gave me morphine. But I know what is happening overseas and I dont need another addirction. I am still into benzo tapering. That is why I gave my supply to my father only keeping 10 tablets with me. And even I am in pain and it takes 30 minutes to pee and somehow go to the bathroom. I have a really calm and uplifted euphoric mood. So yes i could not imagine what it would do on a high dose. " our brain is just not wired for it" ...üòä

685^janglesinthebuilding^black^Just simply said ‚Äúanyone have black‚Äù. There were a couple jackasses offering black dick and other dumb shit but most were about h. One jackass started the convo with ‚Äúif you try something slick it‚Äôll end up on headlines‚Äù. Like I would wanna deal with some fuck like that

685^janglesinthebuilding^black^Believe me, I was surprised af that things went so smoothly. I just made a simple post stating "anyone with black" and had five responses within 30 minutes. Of course there were also scammers and jackasses offering black cock lol. The dude i went with was ready to meet within an hour of first contact. He also gave me his partners number in case he isn't available in the future. It looks like he's going to be my go to for the time being.

686^LSDkiller^opiates^Nothing would work. Not Seroquel or opiates. It's FFI there is no known cure. It's a prion disease. Seroquel is a shitty sleep med anyway and opiates don't help for sleep.

686^LSDkiller^china^You know how it works in China? Half the time after running people over they throw their car in reverse and kill the victims. Terrible.

687^Huskies935^opioid^Not fair I‚Äôm so sorry the opioid crisis is so out of control that those who truly suffer are literally left to suffer

687^Huskies935^opiates^sorry I understand
I‚Äôm slowly losing my sanity over the pain up my ass and in my bladder

I take Ativan it helps a bit. Believe it or not opiates are virtually useless for this pain

buy gel packs at the pharmacy and pack the ice pack between your butt cheeks

688^cleanslateslut^dreams^My husband sleeps naked or in underwear. One day at 4 am , a drunk guy hit out car in our driveway next to our bedroom window and tried to leave, his car was too messed up though. I always sleep with clothes because I have 2 kids and I need to be ready for whatever. So I hop out of bed and see what‚Äôs going on and my husband comes out with his phone in is undies. He wasn‚Äôt vulnerable or hesitant at all, just recording and yelling at dude . I‚Äôm now convinced it‚Äôs fine, be naked and run around in an emergency. I will deal with midnight puking and bad dreams and he can deal with.... drunk guys at 4 am

688^cleanslateslut^opiate^The bubble of numb yes but also it works like an anti depressant in a way, your body won‚Äôt produce dopamine naturally anymore and the opiate replaces it. It gets regular eventually and some people need medication but our bodies are very accepting to opiates as humans.

688^cleanslateslut^opiates^The more I think about it , the further back it goes. I‚Äôve always chased a rush. I climbed trees as tall as my house at age 4/5 because I was so good at it I got a little rush from the risk and confidence combo. In 6th grade, a lot of kids were smoking weed and cigarettes so I tried some from my moms ashtray and got a big headrush. I started choking myself to pass out because it was such a rush. My uncle started paying me in beer and cigarettes to babysit his kids when I was 14. By 15 I was full on smoking cigarettes and weed every day. Then I got a fake ID at age 15 and was buying beer and cigarettes for everyone. Then I got my wisdom teeth pulled and loved the pills. Then I would go to festivals and get acid mushrooms or X and thought I gained more insight of my mind than was possible sober. Then I dated a guy older than me so he was going out to bars all the time and I would tag along with my fake ID. Then we became codependent. Then I had a pretty heavy pill habit that eventually lead to heroin. Then I quit opiates because I realized how dumb it was but I started doing coke instead. I would do any drug at that point. I then started struggling with major neck pain and was prescribed a lot of pills. I started using heroin again when I would run out early. Then I got into treatment and did suboxone maintenance then relapsed a month after my successful taper.Then I got on methadone and stayed on it for 7 years. I was ok with doing it for the rest of my life but I recently got off of that because of all the work I was able to do while stable on a program. I‚Äôm feeling a lot better about having control and I don‚Äôt want to use. I think I‚Äôm prone to addiction because of mental illness and family history. Knowing what I know now at 35, I will definitely take my kids straight to rehab if they start going down that path I did. I wish I went to rehab earlier in life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
689^Forsaken-Tax^opioid^...tramadol is a real opioid, I'm well aware about it's properties. And anything other than that is unfortunately extremely expensive here. 1 pill 5mg oxy for $40 when I can get 100x100mg tramsdol for $110.. I'm also well aware about the W.D, but they're not as severe as all the others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
690^Macadamia1^opiates^Most pharmacies.. actually ALL pharmacies  in Canada ... have signs on the door that say ‚Äúwe do not stock opiates, we pickup upon request only‚Äù

But if your saying that you got thousands at a time, then either 1) the USA needs to adopt that program ... or 2) The signs are a lie to deter theft, and they actually DO stock opiates

Just a question if you don‚Äôt mind... , did you demand ‚Äúall the opiates‚Äù... or just the oxy‚Äôs ???

I mean, since your there anyway, might as well get all the opiates ? I probably would have asked for all the testosterone, Benzo‚Äôs, ADHD meds, cialis/viagara, anti estrogens, thyroid pills... basically everything with street value lol.

However, I understand if you only robbed them or their oxy‚Äôs,  I can attest to being so deep in addiction you don‚Äôt see the big picture ... however, at my most desperate of times I adopted a mindset of ‚Äúanything will do‚Äù rather than tunnel vision on my drug of choice... so I probably would have cleaned the place out of everything they had with value.

690^Macadamia1^opiate^I actually got really fortunate and got my hands on some gabapentin & pregabalin... so those are going to help take 90% of the withdrawals away once I eventually jump off.

... for once I was able to put all the connections I made during my addiction, to good use lmao.

I have been using the gabapentin on days I lower my dose, for example:

Monday
- 20mg AM
- 20mg Lunch
- 20mg PM

Tuesday

15mg + 300 gpent AM
15mg + 300 gpent Lunch
15mg + 300 gpent PM

Wednesday
15mg + 200 gpent AM
15mg + 200 gpent Lunch
15mg + 200 gpent PM

Thursday
15mg + 100 gpent AM
15mg + 100 gpent Lunch
15mg + 100 gpent PM

Frisay
15mg AM
15mg Lunch
15mg PM

So this has helped more than I could ever explain. But I‚Äôve had to be real careful not to get hooked on gabaoentin. They are prescribed in detox centres and rehab houses across North America, I have searched Reddit and there‚Äôs countless members of the opiate recovery community here that credit gabapentin (and Pregabalin) for helping them get through withdrawals, but there‚Äôs also an ex tire community of people trying to get off gabapentin and Pregabalin too, so I‚Äôve been careful not to take it more than a few days in a  row, and then I take at least 7 days before taking the gabaoentin again.

Honestly I feel like they help so much that I could jump off and only feel 10% the withdrawals... but I have a 2 week holidays scheduled from work in 2 months  , so I‚Äôm going to continue my tape and come off then.

If you can find either of these drugs I can‚Äôt urge you enough to try them... but use them wisely, i took too much the first day I had them (cuz , duh, I‚Äôm an addict what else would I do lol) and I felt drunk basically, so I‚Äôll never take 600mg again lol

But if use correctly they are apparently the best drug out there for curing withdrawals once we eventually jump off.

Sorry to hear that you went backwards in your taper, keep chipping away brother.

Cheers!

690^Macadamia1^opiates^Hey,

I have come clean once before, I used clonodine but found that I couldn‚Äôt stay away after taking it, so i only used it at night, and I don‚Äôt like e idea of my blood pressure dropping right before I go to bed... since that is what‚Äôs making me tired from the clonodine, is the blood pressure drop. I have a  BP machine at home as my gf is a nurse and my BP got dangerously low after taking it, she was waking me up during my last detox and taking my BP after taking clonodine and it was like 75/40... so dangerously low. 

So I‚Äôm going to pass on that for now

I am actually wanting to take a more  aggressive approach to my taper that‚Äôs why I asked about using gabapentin, because I thought maybe I could make larger jumps than just a 2mg decrease.

Dropping from 150mg per to day 60 only took 2 weeks, but that‚Äôs cuz I had such a huge dose so it‚Äôs getting harder now.

For sleep I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm going to do, the gabaoentin will take away the restless legs (I used it last time but only had 10 pills and spread them out and damn they helped
I picked up 20 x 75mg Pregabalin today, so I‚Äôm going to use that the first 5 days and then use gabapentin for the next 10 and then come off. Hopefully I won‚Äôt get too addicted.

I also have tons of vitamin C, kratom, and 200 loperamide on hand but I wanna stay away from the latter 2 as their just opiates and combining them with gaba or Pregabalin will probably get me high lol.

I‚Äôve actually started working out 6 days a eeek and eating real healthy during the taper because I thjnk a healthier body will = an easier detox, it only makes sense that the better shape ur body is in the better it will perform under the stress of detox. I competed in bodybuilding shows and actually made it out of the regional level and onto the state level before my addiction, so it was easy for me to pick it back up and hit the weights and the 6-7 daily small high protein meals again. Since I have the knowledge and muscle memory already established. I‚Äôm hoping that will help me sleep, a good workout + lots of vitamins / fish oils / coq10 / pro biotics..: none of them directly aid sleep but I‚Äôm praying that a healthier body will fall asleep eaiser... it‚Äôs a stretch, but from what I‚Äôve read, the restless legs and anxiety / jitters at night are caused by nutrition deficiencies, mainly magnesium but some others.

My doc gave my mirapex for restless legs, so that + pregab / gaba should take care of the RLS. But I would love a medication for sleep, weed makes me sketchy and anxious and I freak out.

I used to use motion sickness tabs but those cause RLS to get worse during withdrawal so I don‚Äôt know what to use ... melatonin is useless and I can‚Äôt get any benzos.... only thing that works is clonodine for me, and I can get that but like I said it knocks me out in a dangerous way.

Sorry for rambling, any suggestions for OTC sleep meds? Or even prescription ones, I could always ask around, the ONE good thing about being an addict is that when u wanna quit, you know where to find all the comfort meds ahaha.

690^Macadamia1^opiate^I was not meaning I‚Äôd completely replace an opiate dose with gabaoentin.... I was  referring to mixing them  throughout the day, here‚Äôs an example :

I‚Äôm just trying to think of a way to implement the Gaba... It seems silly to have access to this amazing drug , yet still suffer withdrawals when I lower my dose during my taper.

Day 1
Hydro 6mg x 5

Day 2
Hydro 6mg x 5

Day 3
Hydro 4mg x 5 (but take 300mg with each dose)

Day 4
Repeat

Day 5
Repeat

Day 6
Hydro 4mg x 5 (without gabapentin)
 
... so basically, when I want to Lower my dose, I will add gabapentin for the first 2-3 days , cu gaba potentials the opiates, a WD‚Äôs I may feel, and then after a few days I will cut the gaba and just do my new dose of hydros.... 

And a few weeks later I‚Äôll repeat... lower my hydro dose and add 300mg gaba with each dose when I‚Äôm lowering it, until I‚Äôm comfortable then take away the gaba... this way I can lower my opiate dose with WD‚Äôs along the way... 

Would this work or no? Gaba potentials opiates that‚Äôs why I am thinking of adding them to my dose whenever I lower my dose, so I can potentials the new (lower) dose for the first few e days and stop the gaba, once my body is used to the new dose.

It Makes sense in theory lol

690^Macadamia1^opiate^I‚Äôve had 4 friends taper suboxone, and when they all jumped off ... every last one of them told me ‚Äúthis naked opiate detox look like a vacation‚Äù... it lasted 30-40 days for them, and they all relapsed after a month, I‚Äôd rather take the opiate detox of 3-4 days lol. Everythint i read on forums says the same, that suboxone is 100x worse when u come off. But I appreciate the suggestion. Thank you !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
691^NurdBurglar^opiate^I‚Äôm very experienced with opiates. Although I‚Äôve not dabbled in them in years because honestly it gets bad fast. So I def know the difference in Oxy (etc) and Kratom. But while Kratom is a weak high, it still effects some of the same receptors neurologically. And while it is an opioid agonist rather than an opiATE, I still think there is going to be a level of cross tolerance. I suspect it will be minimal.

691^NurdBurglar^opiates^Yeah you‚Äôd prob say I have a ‚Äòlow‚Äô tolerance. And I can see how it must work really well as a treatment to help someone step off opiates. I‚Äôm not a heavy user - I was 6 months ago. And off and on here and there it got off the wagon for a couple of days. Then I get back on it. 
My tolerance is enough that I snorted 12mg this morning and am feeling pretty nice. I mean, it‚Äôs not like oxy, it‚Äôs a peculiar drug.  And I‚Äôm not necessarily trying to get an oxy type buzz from because I know that‚Äôs not how it works. 

Sounds like what I hear you saying is beyond that initial 12 mg to do anymore would be a waste. Right. 
8 don‚Äôt have a ton of them so I‚Äôm not gonna be using it daily for a long time. Just experimenting.

691^NurdBurglar^opiate^I‚Äôve got a pretty high opiate tolerance at this point in my life. But I just haven‚Äôt used suboxone ever until recently.

691^NurdBurglar^opiate^Certainly! Yesterday morning I started really small, like 2 mg. I know lots of ppl suggested 1 mg or less. But I don‚Äôt think they understand that Kratom, regardless of your opinion of it, was going to have some degree of cross tolerance. 9 AM 2mg, felt nothing. Noon did 4 mg more. At this point I could tell something was in my system but it was of now recreational value. Around 4 PM did 4mg more. Again, could sense an opiate, but ever so mildly. 
This morning I started w 12 mg all at once, up ye ole sniffer. There was definitely a degree of recreational value in this dose. But it wasn‚Äôt anything to write home about. Around 3 sniffed another 8mg and that was the end of my supply. If I had more then tomorrow morning I probably would have tried 16 or 20 mg at once. 

Long story short; even though Kratom is weak, a high tolerance to it must give you a high tolerance to the other actual opiates. 
In the end, I actually enjoy a dose of 25mg Kratom over the 12mg of bupe.

691^NurdBurglar^opiate^Sorry there is more to that story. I thought I was replying on a different sub. I didn‚Äôt start off trying 12 mg. First day I tried 2 mg and didn‚Äôt feel nothing at all. Then tried 8. Felt a little bit. Then today 12mg and it was ok.  
I‚Äôm basically out of it now. I just happened across 4 pills and was really hoping to get some recreational value out of them. And I didn‚Äôt know if Kratom tolerance for absolute sure effects opiate tolerance. Now I know. It does.

691^NurdBurglar^opiate^If you use it during opiate withdrawals it DEFINITELY causes the already existing insomnia and RLS to be worse.

691^NurdBurglar^opiates^Thank you for this! Yes I figured maaaayyyybe starting w 1mg. 
I used to use opiates pretty heavily years ago. But haven‚Äôt done anything in years except a few codeine pills. 
I didn‚Äôt know though how much, of at all, my Kratom tolerance would impact the dosage I should start with. 
Anyway, I‚Äôve got 3 8mg tablets. I don‚Äôt have to be in any rush. I can start small and still have plenty to experiment with.

692^mattanophelia^opioid^"Rates of new opioid prescriptions (\~25%) and visits to the emergency room (\~45%) remained high for all groups in the 6 months after ending buprenorphine treatment."

The 5% is for overdoses.

Edit: Yeah you're right, I specifically said overdose risk in my initial comment, so I was mistaken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
693^exoticflyingbird^opiates^agreed. it takes a lot to get high and in my opinion other opiates have a better high. shame as it‚Äôs probably the easiest to get

694^rjstim^gum^Ever hear of *snus*? It comes in little pouches that u tuck on the side of ur gums like dip, but it doesn't require spitting and comes in sealed packets. It's definitely doable in a concealed manner. They should sell it at most stores that sell cigs. The best kinds are from Sweden where it originated (General is a really good one), but they make American brands like Camel now, though not as good. The other good thing is it's not nearly as bad for u as regular dip. Anyway that would satisfy nic cravings, as would something like nicorette gum..

694^rjstim^opiates^Yes, but ur generally not gonna see those people on a forum like this, which is mostly enthusiasts who've crossed that recreational line a long time ago lol. I think I read before that out of every single person who takes opiates in a given year, the vast majority aren't addicted. Kinda tough to really verify though..

694^rjstim^china^It's certainly more profitable than real dope. And if ur getting pure fent wholesale, I'm not sure what could have a higher profit potential? Just for an example, let's say we're talking about a finger (10g) of solid 50% purity heroin for $750. To make an equipotent finger of fentadope instead, you'd only need 200mg of fent, so 0.2g of it. So let's say u ordered a full gram of pure fent from China and got a good deal at $50 (I don't know the actual prices, but that sounds feasible). You'd be able to make 5 fingers or 50g of fentadope, which would easily be worth $50/g itself. So just with that scenario right there, pure fent can have a 50x profit potential! No way ur getting anywhere near a 50x markup with real dope, or any other drug I can think of. What can beat that? This is why dealers can sell it so  much cheaper than real dope, and make LOADS more profit doing it..

694^rjstim^opium^The usual way is to just score [slit] the pods at the opportune time, and collect the opium latex after it oozes out. It contains morphine, codeine, thebaine, and lots other opiates/alkaloids. They usually do this a few times to collect max opium. Another way is to process the entire plant, stems and all (called poppy straw), but that's more of an industrial large-scale method. Are u sure u have the right kind of poppy with morphine? I've never tried opium like that, but I'd love to grow it myself. I live in a recently legalized state and was able to grow my own cannabis for the first time this past summer along with tomatoes ‚Äì and that was *awesome*. I'd love to have my own plantation with poppy and coca thrown into the mix too though. I love gardening but I'd love to process my own H & C as well lol..

694^rjstim^opiates^You'll get a little higher? That's how I've always used opiates, redosing through the day, instead of just doing 1 large dose all at once..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Codeine isn't active, is a pro drug means that it must first pass in the liver and get metabolized into morphine, then it goes into the bloodstream and pass the blood brain barrier.

More than 800mg of codeine is extremely dangerous to the body, heroin is a different substance and definitely more powerful.

When I hadn't tolerance around 250 Mg of codeine gave me a nice high, felling warm and stuff. It can give you an idea of opiates. 
If you're the first times start at 120mg max, don't push. For example I always preferred pharmaceuticals stuff rather than street drugs. Heroin IV is another world, like morphine iv. Never go there. You can have nice highs from weaker stuff without using needles.

If we're speaking about smoking/snorting heroin codeine is definitely weaker but as I said can give you an idea of the opiate effects.

This is granted, but be careful, even weaker opiates can trigger strong addiction. I know that.....

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiates^Hope you're like my gf. I was/am an oxy addict, start with H and ended up with pharma stuff.
Now I'm in detox but that's not the point.
I baked myself on oxys multiple times and my gf does the same, but she never, never crave opi or develop tolerance.
I was using daily, she don't. She never comes to me asking for opiates, and never used more than one/two times in a month.

Addiction to opiates can be subtle, everyone at the start thought that we can manage, but in the end 98% of ppl got hooked.

I tried to detox multiple times in this 10 years of addiction, I feel like I'm in heaven and next day straight to hell. Feeling hot and cold and the same time, shittin in my pants with cramps, craving for a dose.

You tried, you felt it. Now let it go until you can.

Best wishes

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opioid^I'm in a similar situation but slightly different.
I quit cold turkey oxy from 120-160mg daily and im using kratom to help withdrawal.
I'm on day 11 from quitting oxy and I want to stay at 25g daily kratom.

From a "scientific view" we're both in a situation where are opioid receptors looking for a balance, from cutting an X amount of a specific substance.

Right now it's 4 days that I impose to take max 25g of kratom (4 days before I was up to 50g kratom and dxm to ease wds) and I feel better everyday, very slightly cause I was on another and most addictive drug, but I can feel the different. IMHO in a week max you'll feel good.
This is not to underestimate your symptoms, absolutely wds are real, but don't be afraid of that, it will ends very soon if you want.

I hear people who doesn't suffer at all the process of cutting kratom. It's another substance rather than classic opioids and everyone's different. Maybe in 3 days you'll be cool.

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiates^If you're concerned about opiates only I GUESS you're fine.
BUT, if you took DHC with acetaminophen and drink alcohol that's really bad.
For me it took 2 months of a high daily alcohol intake to get my Œ≥GT through the roof. Make a blood test.

If you stick to opiates only (gabap is quite harmless by itself), unless you OD, you're fine. Drink shit loads of water.

Acetaminophen can cause serious illness, and the OD is sneaky, you know if you had too much only 2 or 3 days later, unless you know that you ingested more than 6-8g a day an go to ER, in that case within 8h from ingestion is treatable with acetylcisteine.

I took opiates from 10 years, never had an OD, I'm healthy (except mentally speaking, I suffer from depression and I'm a fucking addict that push everything to the limits), never took >8g of apap in a day, always preferred pharmaceuticals rather than streets drugs, and always looked and avoided dangerous interactions.

I dunno if you're still takin acetaminophen (apap), but if I were you I'll avoid alcohol and apap like a plague.

Take a blood test and see your GP.

This is not a medical advice, I'm not a physician, I'm speaking by personal experience and nursing studies.

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Fuck yeah. I also when stopped opiates/kratom my sex drive is insane. Every opiate agonist kills testosterone. 
Well... What can I say... Enjoy mate!

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Interesting aspect. I read that somewhere, that touches different receptors than classic opiate agonist like oxy or heroin.
The physical part of wd I can pass on it. But man, the mental part is a bitch. I hate the anxiety sensation and feel dysphoric.

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Hi French cousin, I'm Italian. Here it's banned since 2016. If you took kratom recreationally (not to get high only, but for energy etc) its OK to leave the boat.
But... And I don't want to break any reddit rules, if you take it to stay away from other hard drugs or to cope an addiction I say "fuck that", continue your kratom path.
Kratom save me from a decade opiate addiction, I'm still battling but it helps more than shitty methadone or subs.

If you dunno where to buy pm me, I buy online from a trusted source in EU. I don't making advertising, just help a mate in need (if is that case).
I can't say where here on public, I already break this rule once.

Best wishes

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^So it's like a classic opiate wd in your experience? Everyone's different so I have interest in every opinion.
How much did you took? Stopped cold turkey or by taper?
Luckily I dont have heath issue or pain. But wd sucks either.

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Glad to hear that. I mean, the comparison to hydro not your story, I'm sorry for that.
I always found that opiate wds is bearable with the right meds (like clonidine and benzos for ex)
definitely not funny, but doable. The worst part is when the pain fades and the mind start shitting stupid rationalization like "well im clean now, I can use" or "my pinky hurts, ima take an 80s just to be sure". Now I'm in that part.

Happy to hear that kratom wds aren't as bad as other stuff I was taking. The RLS is really annoying, but is an input to keep taking my kratom and taper slowly. With a taper plan I guess I'm going to feel anything.

Just to know, how much kratom you were taking and for how long you've been on it at the time of the story?

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opioid^I was 18, innocent and happy to bought 10g of black hash. Really good hash. Soft, black as night outside and when broken green as a leaf inside, with that weed oil smell that only hash can give.

I thank my bro, I put the 10g in my shorts, actually, between my nuts with my dick over to cover my "ovulo" (we call that in Italy, ovulo is a drug eaten and pooped, cleaned but still intact).

I forgot to go to the bath in my bro house, so I go quickly home. Everything fine, no cops or shit.
I parked my bike, and I though "damn I need to go to the bath, really quick!"
I run on the stairs, bringing to my house, I enter and I jump on the toilet, I start to piss first but I hear a "plop..." I though "wtf? I hadn't poo already... OH FUCK!"
Of course it was my hash, without thinking I turn back with no pants on and I put my arm in the toilet (I know, sounds too trainspotting, but it wasn't an opioid supp unfortunately) and grab at the last moment the hash.

Well, at least I only piss on that... And it was still close so if it resist the gastric acid can handle easily some piss on in...

I washed my ovulo and enjoy later.

Happy ending.

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Like ksmith said be careful, it can really cause resp depression if you take enough kratom.
Honestly no, I didn't notice that when mix kratom and alcohol, just an increase of the two.

Weed is always in my stash but I'm not a pot head anymore. I like smoke bongs and joints but in the evening and not even everyday right now.
Mary Jane make me anxious sometimes, but never happen with kratom alone or mixed with other things.

From a "scientific" view kratom bonds to opiate receptors, and less to NMDA, GABA, dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Alcohol bonds to GABA (but other sub receptors than kratom) 
Weed bonds to the cannabinoids receps, so it's a different story.

But the rule: everyone is different and react differently, is always true.

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiates^Thanks man. Really. I made those questions mainly for curiosity but, I'm an addict. I'm today 2 week clean and yesterday I use.
Now I explain why (I'm not rationalize it)

I was detox for 5th time from a decade addiction (morphine, oxy, fentanyl, heroin, codeine, tramadol ecc...) im not in pain physically, so I use it to get merely high. I'm in a period of big changes and I was going good with a little of kratom but, the idea of never use opiates again, even for legit pain when happens, scared me to death and trigger bad cravings.

Yesterday I took oxys, and I was like... That's it?! "I'm laying on bed, feeling good all alone, without my gf, without energy to study or doing things. Is it worth it?!" my final answer is NO. Is not worth it.

I need it. I was in need to do that. I also made a video of myself in that state, to remember what I stated. In this week's I got a rush for life, I enjoyed more talk to people, sex was great, I was more confident and finally more myself.
Popping pills is not the answer and yesterday I get it, in deep.

It may sounds weird, or an excuse, but right now I'm feeling very good, I don't have cravings I'm more confident to go straight to my goal: living next week with my gf, find a work while I do exams for university and then being finally a nurse (yep, I'm studying nursing).

When I'll be in hospital, in my hands will pass every kind of drugs, the drugs I used to love, and I MUST be in control. I also saved some oxys to keep rotting on my shelf. It must be my decision not take drugs anymore, not the lack of those.

Sounds really weird, I know, but it worked.
And next time I'll crave that sh*t I'll take a look at my video of that "last night". It was like a comrade, a friend I used to see and now I want to leave, you must say goodbye to him and understand deeply why.

And your words encourage me more than before.
Thanks again, and thanks everyone that answer to me.

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiates^Got a clonidine patch on my body right now (guess why ahah).

Very deep answer, thank you. I always thought that it can't be real getting hooked again in so short time, but some ppl on forum says so and fucks me up a bit.

In past, after withdrawing cold turkey, I used opiates after short time but wds doesn't came back. But, some states that got worse during time and the next withdrawal will be heavier and tolerance skyrocket in matter of days.
Being in a fragile period, all that made me think a lot, and I cannot understand that from a physiological view.

2+2 is always 4.
Thanks for your time

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^I switched from an oxy habit to kratom and my sex drive is coming back. But even that I'm not 100%. Kratom touches opiate receptors, even if its not a proper opioid, it lowers testosterone levels like every other opiate does. Of course the impact is far less heavy when it comes to kratom, but it's there.

Take the least amount you can to not going into withdrawal, spread more the intake during the day and your sex drive will increase a bit.

I'm taking 25g daily, when I see my gf I take less (5g is my single dose, when it comes to sex I take 3-3.5g) and I can have sex, even more than one time a day.

Im a person who suffer a lot from sex disfunction when Im on opiates, with Oxycodone i barely can have sex once a week, and the orgasm was not pleasant as natural (also shorter).

If you already cut from 15g to 10g you must be cool, but if you feel not ready, try to taper more or
the day you see your gf try stay off kratom until sex happens and dose after having sex.

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiates^I'm into kratom from a year, but I'm still a novice so don't take for granted that I'm right.
Being a decade opiates junkie I read/study the substances I used to know how it all works, also studying nursing at university helps.

From what I read, and i can be wrong, 2 solutions cames in mind.

1) you're ordering from the same vendor and same strain, but being a plant the alkaloids in it can vary. For example if you buy always red Borneo strain, one batch can differ from another, and I guess that all the kratom a seller has, doesn't came from the SAME plant.
Also, I read that older kratom is more powerful than a younger one.

Or

2) less is more. Some ppl with tolerance, used to take 10g (the dosage are merely an example) finds that lowering the dose, let's say 5g, it's  more effective and euphoric rather than dosing full. I don't get this either, but everyone's different. 

From what I experienced: got cold turkey from 160mg oxycodone daily, took 50g of kratom the first days. After a week I wanted to be stable at the dosage of max 30g to start taper lately.
The following days, I kept a journal, to keep track of my daily intake, and most of the times I ended up taking less than 25g daily, a dose that a week before used at once. And I'm feeling good.
This morning it's 8 days that I'm sticking to this schedule, and early awake I took 8g split in 2 doses. Result : I feel warm and slightly high.

There's no definite answer from my experience, cause pharmacologically speaking, I don't know wtf is going on but it's real.

I used to have a godzilla tolerance before detox, a year ago I was using 6mg or even 10mg (10000ug) of fentanyl at once to get slightly high, on top of 100mgs of methadone. Madness. 
Everytime I relapse on oxys, even after a few months period, my tolerance skyrocket in couple of weeks, force me to pop an handful of pills (20s or 40s). 

With kratom it's all different, and definitely save my life. There's few scientific articles, and most are controversy, we (as species) need to study better this plant, and there's no definitive answer from what I know. 

Sorry if my comment gave you more questions than answers. 

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Kratom replace my strong painkiller addiction.
Thus plant saved my life, I went through withdrawal cold turkey from 160mgs of oxys and a year ago it helps me to cope a cold turkey from 700mgs to ZERO.

Now I'm 12days clean thanks to kratom, I'm taking reasonable dosage (25g daily) and I'll taper slowly over time.

I feel better, it gave me the strength to do things during the withdrawal.

The red veins strains have an opiate-like effect, but itself kratom is not an opiate. It's not a drug to concern like the media can say. It's not addictive like painkillershit, but a great substance to help in everyday life, like caffeine.

I'm glad to this forum, people who answer to my doubt and help me during the worst part of detox.

I have a friend who isn't an addict like me, and he enjoy kratom once in a while to chill in the evening.

I smoke Marijuana since I was 15 (I'm 29) and it's not the same thing. Marijuana can trigger anxiety or panic attacks along with a bit of addiction (we have super potent weed in this times, shit with more than 25% THC, insane), kratom doesn't. Of course you can get addicted if you have a personality like mine, damn I got addicted even on vitamin C... But for a guy who wants a chill evening is great.

Also most people use more energyzing strains to work out in gym.

It's a very wide spectrum substance, can helps in multiple ways.

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Opiates in general lower testosterone. I'm detox from stronger opi like oxy and Heroin and when I was on it (most of the time oxys, at least couple of years) my sex drive got crash.

Kratom stimulates Œº and Œ¥ opiates receptors, with a lower binding affinity than oxy/morphine but still.
Im 11 days clean and I feel I was back at my adolescent times. Orgasms are much stronger and I have the desire to have sex at least 2x a day. My girlfriend thanks. I got testosterones rushes, like being aggressive like a dumb macho with people who annoy me (not my personality, I'm a very reasonable person, usually). 

I experienced this kind of stuff everytime I detox, with time everything go back to normal. kratom isn't an opiate but acts like so, therefore it's normal to have a lower sex drive while on it.

Try to cut the dosage or decrease the times per week. Once a week maybe it's OK, but try to rotate strains to avoid tolerance.

Before my opiate tolerance skyrocket, and proper addiction came in, I was using Heroin 1 times every 2 week and I wasn't withdrawing.

Kratom is obviously different, and far less addictive than H or pharma-shit, so if you take it like once every 10 days IMO you're cool.

S

695^SteveDeQuincey^opiate^Thanks mate, I was almost freak out thinking about another withdrawal.
I stopped cold turkey from 700mgs oxys to zero last summer. With comfort meds I made it but I relapse 2 months later.
Knowing the drill I tried to stay lower than before (100-160mg daily).

I'm on day 10 of wds right now, it's the 3rd day that I take 22-25g of kratom and the symptoms are very mild. 

I was scared caming off kratom. But reading you guys, I'm very confident to taper, and look normal (unlike when trying to taper methadone or oxys, where I was covered in sweat, dysohoric and anxious to begin with).

Every time I detox I buy clonidine, benzo, Zolpidem, lyrica, dxm and kratom.
This time is mild-moderate wds but today I feel better, I can stay under 25g of kratom daily and the taper schedule and support that you gave me (speaking to all you guys of r/kratom) made me go berserk and blow this fuc*ING addiction away!

Thanks everyone. I'll keep update in another thread (opiate withdrawal and kratom)

Peace

696^SorrowFloats91^black^People also constantly talk about how good people on EBT eat, how they buy expensive food, how they get whatever they want when the Hardworking Americans pay for it with their taxes.

So I definitely think there's a subtle racism to this (behind the obvious racism). Like - White people abuse the system so they can get delicious food that's out of reach for most people. Black people abuse the system to buy drugs or by selling the card for money. It's like the "sin" of the white folks is using a card to get expensive food for a sophisticated palate. Minorities just want drugs. 

It's stupid, but whenever there's a case about misused benefits, they seem to tweak that narrative based on the race of the recipient.

698^BrahBrahBrownSheep^opiate^Opiate withdrawal is almost never fatal in otherwise healthy individuals.  Biggest concern as far as that goes would be preexisting heart conditions that can be exasperated.

699^lostinthesauceband^black^I'm looking forward to Donut Operator putting out a video on this. Seems pretty black and white, but it's an out of context video. There have been so many cases where until the body cam or details of the incident are made public, people go nuts on Twitter

699^lostinthesauceband^opioid^Ayo from /r/ChronicPain.  



I'd say kratom, but it's weak sauce compared to literally anything else. What's weird is it straight up kills the euphoria that other opioids provide, which a lot of people see as a bad thing, but for chronic pain I see the ceiling effect and other weird quirks to the plant as ideal for long term use. Or at least as ideal as you can get, because nothing is okay for long term use tbh.  
   


I threw up every prescription opioid I've ever taken, but I can count on two hands how many times I've thrown up kratom. I just can't keep that shit down, but kratom is a godsend. 
    


I would also just like to say, my mom is a pillhead, I got the fuck away from her because she was off the deep end. I don't abuse the medications I am provided, and consider myself a pain patient, not a drug addict. I draw these lines between "addiction" and "dependence", say that just because I don't ramp my doses or seek drugs which would actually get me high instead of what taking the same dose of kratom every 4 hours does to me that I am somehow avoiding being like her. 



At the end of the day, the difference is minimal. You're (or me in this case) still choking down a ton of drugs every day. It's a lot easier to say that you're different than everyone here, that there are zero things in common between the homeless people shooting up on the street, but that's bullshit. I'm not trying to like, burst your bubble, because I've been right where you're at in the past, unsure whether to post here or there, unsure if I'm really in any way related to people who abuse the same pills that I need to survive, etc. 
   


It's fucked. I used to blame people in this sub for my meds getting cut off. I know now it's so much more than that, but it's hard to see what's going on behind the scenes if you don't know what to look for. Andrew Kolodny and PROP are who to blame. Purdue Pharmaceuticals starting this leg of the mess of an opioid epidemic we face in the late 90s/early 2000s

Yeah, cops don't rat out dirty cops, racist cops, and overall shitheads who are powertripping with a badge and a gun. Yeah, there's enough of them doing bad shit that I don't fucking trust them not to shoot me or do something else fucked up. But this isn't another unarmed black person they shot, or drugs planted in another car.        
     
Pedos are something murderers and rapists in prison for the rest of their lives will see as deplorable and will carry out vigilante justice on.

His boss? Now that I could see being a bit more likely.

699^lostinthesauceband^black^I think your average day beat cop might kill an unarmed black person. I don't think they'll protect some guy sniffing a 3 year old's panties at an open house.

699^lostinthesauceband^opioid^I only let opioid naive penises fuck my girl, bruh. That dick doesn't last nearly as long once they've built that tolerance and earned the title "junkie".    
    
   

And I mean he's gotta have enough dick for me and her, so stamina is key üëå.

700^bigcaponcampus^opiate^Alright awesome, thanks for the info! I‚Äôm a little opiate naive, I just started on them a few days ago with 10mg oxys, will the morphine give me a nod you think or will I just feel nice? Not looking for a heavy nod

Edit: I‚Äôm using them for pain, not just fucking around with them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
701^RCJerry^china^I wasn't impressed by phenibut. Didn't do much for me and reading all the horror stories of withdrawal/dependence made me kind of give up on it entirely.

If you're looking to ruin your gaba system to get high I don't know why anyone would bother with it when China will send you all the benzos you want

701^RCJerry^opioid^It's not coincidence

Opioid withdrawal is very similar (but far more horrible) to being sick. Hence the slang "dope sick" and "getting well". Odds are pretty good you've been sick and didn't notice because kratom masked the symptoms

701^RCJerry^opiate^Can't comment as I haven't noticed that trend myself. It's possible tho. Kindling definitely exists for benzos, why wouldn't it exist for mu agonists?

I've taken up to 25-30g a day, spread throughout the day.

Still, not feeling much in the way of withdrawal.

Only notable experience I've had with traditional opioid withdrawal was a decade ago when my wisdom teeth prescription was 30 5mg hydro with 2 refills plus a ziploc of percs and Dilaudid from my sister. Blew through it all with my opiate loving friend in about 2 weeks.

Mild withdrawal for a couple days due to how fast we blew (literally in the case of the hmorph) it all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
702^TownHallBall^opiates^He won't go into precipitated withdrawals no matter what at this point.  That's inky when you take a sub too soon after dosing your regular opiates.  

To answer his question though; that's a big dose you took.  To feel it I'd wait at least 48 hours.  72 if you can hold out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
703^adamsapple87^opiates^One more thing, if the hardest part of stopping using for you is your brain convincing you that you need to use and not the physical symptoms, a great tool that works for me is ashwagandha.  If I take 1200-1500 mg of ashwagandha every 4-6 hours while I'm trying to not use opiates, it puts my mind state fully on board.  I'm totally rational and mentally I feel super strong and don't need to use.  It also helps tremendously with sleep, you just have to take a lot before bed.  Hope this helps!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
704^meleejosh^opiate^Opiates feel great in the moment we all know that but they‚Äôre not a long term thing. We use them because there‚Äôs things in our life that aren‚Äôt how we want them, life‚Äôs not how we envisioned. 
I‚Äôve been where you are before and I relapsed... it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Stay on the sober road
It‚Äôs much easier to stay opiate free if you‚Äôre leading a healthy life , include positive things like exercise, healthy eating, prayer and religion,

704^meleejosh^opiates^Sorry if you don‚Äôt want to answer that‚Äôs fine, I didn‚Äôt know your friend I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôm trying to stop opiates though. I was wondering what happened? How old was your friend?

704^meleejosh^opiate^Oh you‚Äôre very fortunate 
Usually by day 2-4 the depression begins and it‚Äôs really bad.. 
exercise is a good one because it‚Äôs like a replacement for the opiate
Healthy eating is one I try to start once I quit

704^meleejosh^opiates^Can I ask how did you get onto taking opiates? And what do they do for you ? For me they take my worries away, they make me productive and more confident, I‚Äôm more social as well. 
They also take away anxiety for me.

704^meleejosh^opiates^Yeh I‚Äôve be meaning to start for about a month now, I go 1 or 2 days and the depression comes on. I use to stick to withdrawal, just embrace it and ride through the symptoms.
Do you find tapering works better for you than cold turkey? 
I don‚Äôt think I could taper as I think I‚Äôd just end up taking too much. And there is no euphoria with tapering is there? 
Unfortunately I know how it goes .. 
I was listening to a really interesting podcast about opiates and other drugs but mainly the opiates.. it‚Äôs johann Yari talking to joe Rogan. There‚Äôs two podcasts and it‚Äôs the most recent of the two. The first one is worthwhile too.
You might be interested, basically he after travelling all around the world talking to experts, addicts and reviewing the literature has come to the conclusion that people don‚Äôt continue to take opiates because of the ‚Äòchemical hook‚Äô.  Rather they take opiates to make up for an infilled life, a lack of relationships, unhappy at work, crap or non existent social life etc etc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
705^A_Happy_Egg^opiate^I actually love telling people this, because hopefully they would learn from my mistake. 

(I rarely get to though, because it‚Äôs hard to find the right time to say ‚Äúhey who wants to hear about what sparked my drug problems!‚Äù)

The first time I tried opiates, I considered the high to be the pinnacle of happiness that the human body can achieve. One may disagree, but I have never found anything comparable to the feeling of a good opiate buzz, except maybe the thrill felt during early childhood. 

If I could go back in time, I would have never allowed myself to try them, ignorance is bliss. 

I recently had a 3 year relationship come to an end, and if I was already susceptible to the opiate high before, I essentially brought myself to depend on it to allow me to smile each night. That‚Äôs kinda how it got out of hand. I never tracked how long it had been until I ran out. 

It was a vicious cycle of waking up, going to work, coming home, dosing, sleeping, repeat. 

I would take that dose each night to be able to sit down and enjoy myself without drifting to the typical depressing thoughts I think normally, let alone after a breakup. 

Truthfully for the past 7 weeks, most of my free time has been spent reading a 6-book fantasy series, and if it were not for the pills, I don‚Äôt think I would have finished the books. I am not at ALL saying this is a *good* thing, but hopefully that sheds light on what I was getting out of them. Had I NOT taken the pills, I doubt I would have been able to get so absorbed in the story I was reading. My sober mind is quick to find dark thoughts, and I dwell on them. While I have a buzz going, however minimal it may be, I can avoid that.

TL;DR: The opiate buzz is what I unfortunately consider the highest level of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù. Recently went through a breakup, got carried away compensating for my sadness with the opiate buzz.

705^A_Happy_Egg^opiate^I am going to sound overly excited about this reply, but your answer genuinely slowed my heart rate. 

I have pre-existing (non opiate related) anxiety, and the nervousness that crept
into my head over the last two days as I really grasped that 2 months of usage was going to have to stop, was crippling. I have a history of letting anxiety get in the way of logical thinking. 

I feel much more confident after reading your reply. I checked the half life of both drugs early on, and suspected that physical dependency is not likely considering the drug is eliminated many hours before I re-dose, like you said. 

The psychological dependency is the aspect that i am certain of. I can beat it, just the fear of WD alone is putting me through hell...

Anyways, I appreciate you taking the time to type out your reply. Thank you.

709^pillsandpowders^opiate^Oh snap eh? As in boofing is better than snorting? I had read that they both had about a 50% bioavailability. I‚Äôd definitely be down to give that try for the hell of it. I‚Äôm hoping putting it up my nose is still decently efficient though, as that‚Äôs a little more practical for dosing on-the-go

Any recommendations on how many mgs per ml of water? I checked some opiate conversion tables online and apparently 18mg hydromorphone is approximately the equivalent to 45 mgs of oxy so I‚Äôd likely be throwing 27-36mg of the hydromorphone up there

Thanks flizz

710^opiatetrippin^opioid^I seen this to it just aired like a hour ago I was watching Live PD and seen how he didn‚Äôt know wtf Keaton was which was his fault but to label it as a wole different thing it is odd and he needs to get second opinion or just wait to test it instead of just assuming it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpice!‚Äù But that‚Äôs just lack of knowledge I feel that all cops should be informed what Kratom is being we have a ‚Äúopioid epidemic ‚Äú but I hope that guy doesn‚Äôt get extra charges for the cops lack of knowledge!

710^opiatetrippin^opiates^So can u still take Opiates with methadone? And not subs right? I‚Äôve heard u can go get a does of methadone and still go use some H? Is this true as white subs u can take any opiates and get high u will go into instant WD?

712^Dylantki^opiate^I haven‚Äôt really seen many ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù been using it for probably two weeks. I‚Äôm using it for opiate replacement therapy (: 

I didn‚Äôt take it yesterday to see the effects and I had more trouble sleeping than normal. I managed to fall asleep a 5 AM and slept through until 6 AM and it was on and off being able to sleep :-(

712^Dylantki^black^It‚Äôs my roommates haha! Mine is a typical lame black scale but I can‚Äôt find it at the moment. He got it on amazon!

712^Dylantki^opiate^I don‚Äôt even wanna imagine the amount of sludge. Especially taking 4-7 grams twice a day. I don‚Äôt intend to continue taking Kratom for longer than my opiate withdrawal lasts, but in case something changes; I‚Äôll keep that in mind (:

712^Dylantki^opiates^I just had surgery recently so my Crohns inflammation is nearly eradicated for now, hence I‚Äôm not in much pain. It‚Äôs started back up slightly but I‚Äôm hoping that Kratom is enough for the pain and I don‚Äôt have to start taking opiates again. I‚Äôm trying to use it for opioid replacement therapy, just to cover me during the withdrawals and it seems to be working as I‚Äôm not craving. They‚Äôre 1.5 grams each so yup (: I take a few and hope for the best.

712^Dylantki^opiates^I‚Äôve been taking opiates for about 8 months now, I did a three week taper and my body is most definitely feeling the effects of withdrawal from dependency but I‚Äôm not mentally craving on day 4! My mood fluctuates so much, I‚Äôm anxious and the RLA is killer but I won‚Äôt allow myself to continue to take them unless I‚Äôm in an awful, long flare like I was before. Best of luck to you!

716^Forward-Presence^opiates^Well fuck man sounds better than my clinic at least man. It's like pulling fucking teeth to get an increase at my clinic it's insane. I was started at 25mg got up to 50mg and went to see the doctor again (you have to see the doctor Everytime you want an increase they are only there 3 times a week too btw) I go see my doctor and tell her I need an increase the dose still isn't working. She fucking argues with me and says I don't look like I'm in withdrawals and says I look tired so the medicine must be working! I explained I looked tired because I work the fucking night shift and didn't go to bed until 3am and woke up at 5am to come to the clinic of course I'm tired and the dumb bitch sat there and continued to argue with me and insist that because I looked tired after having no sleep the medicine must be working. I told her that had literally nothing to do with the medicine anybody who got 3 hours of sleep would be tired nothing to do with methadone. After like 20 minutes of arguing with this bitch and reminding her that I literally did 500mg-1000mg of IV oxy A DAY on the street she bumped me up 10mg and told me not to bother seeing her again until next fucking week it was a Monday too! Said my dose needed time to stabilize. It took me over a month to get to a decent dose and now that I'm on a decent dose I want off cause I'm still craving dope all the time methadones a fucking joke. I'm tapering off now. I would advise everybody to stay off methadone and any other joyless government opiates

716^Forward-Presence^opiate^Do heroin. seriously. I am an opiate addict and it has ruined my life, but you bet if I had 6 months left to live that's what I'd be doing. I'm a heroin/opiate/cocaine/alcohol addict and heroin and opiates are 10x better than alcohol. You really should try it if your intent on just getting blasted and enjoying your last few months here on Earth I highly recommend it fucked up as it may sound.


You should inject it too. Don't snort or smoke it or eat it that's a waste shooting it feels the best. I recommend oxycontin Dilaudid and oxymorphone too. They are 3 extremely powerful pharmaceutical opiates that rival heroin in power and euphoria.

Do a speedball while your at it. Shoot H and coke in the same syringe or at least smoke some crack after doing a fat shot of dope.


You can get some off the deep web if you don't know any drug dealers. If you decide to go down this road PM me and Ill give you some good info.


Maybe this is really fucked up of me I feel a little fucked up posting it but fuck man you've got 6 months left to live you are already an addict and you want to spend your last bit of time here on Earth totally blasted and in chemical bliss I understand I would have the same reaction and I feel like you should get the most out of your last 6 months if you've decided that's what you wanna do. You should enjoy your last 6 months to the maximum. Take it from an opiate and alcohol addict. Opiates are a lot more euphoric and better than booze in every way. No hangover either from heroin or opiates!

So if you decide you want to experience heroin before you pass PM me and I'll help you and give you some info.

716^Forward-Presence^opiates^Yea! And it fucking sucks! I see no point in being addicted to a joyless government synthetic opioid. And paying $1000 a month for the inconvience of waking up at 5am everyday and hauling ass to the clinic to dose and be drug tested every other day and have some dumbass counselor tell me that I'm still using heroin because my dose just isn't high enough! It's almost like their making a ton of money off me and want me on 200mg and totally fucking dependent on their fucking government welfare dope. I would feel exactly the same with no maintinence meds I'm just sober all the time. I hate this garbage it doesn't help at all doesn't fix my cravings or do shit to help me. 

I need to get back on subs then I can taper off the subs by myself in less than 2 weeks with no probkem. I've tapered off subs by myself a bunch of times I don't wanna be steeping down from methadone 10mg a week for the next 10 fucking weeks tho. I can get on and off subs quicker. I just want opiates totally out of my life I don't want to be on any at all maintinence meds don't help me

718^thetechevolution^opiates^Constipation was a prevailing theme after the RPLND. True, it is hellacious. Perhaps you can resort to IV push opiates alone.

718^thetechevolution^opioid^If you opt in for RPLND, make sure to get an epidural done and IV morphine or Dilaudid push on top of oral oxycodone. If they are unwilling to work with you, write a letter to your PCP or palliative care. Or better yet, find another hospital. The opioid crisis is **not your fault**, so why suffer from restrictions imposed on you for someone else's wrong doing? That's like serving a life sentence when the real killer is still out there and you were framed.

719^QuitVGsForever^black^I get higher from codeine than an average user due to using potentiators like black pepper and DXM. I'm 100% positive that the high I get from 150mg codeine equals more to 50-60mg morphine than 15mg. It even feels very similar.

I'm an experienced IV user. Like I said, 60mg IV morphine gets me very high.

721^Kaldaus^opiates^Its such a sad situation, thank you so much for your service, I wish I could be of more help but unfortunately opiates in any form are very difficult to get, at least by legal means. I hear on the news all the time how many pills there are and how many prescriptions, blah blah blah. My advice would be to try and work out some sort of payment plan, you can also try and get the clinic to write a letter that you are NOT a drug addict and entered the clinic for pain, its important, if you can get that letter you can use it to get into a pain management clinic that will take your insurance. You also need to contact your local veterans office, and file a complaint, and document all that you can. You can also contact local officials or your states medical board, there is not a lot of hope with a lot of this, and I am sorry I cant be of more help. I wish you the very very best, and hope you are able to find a solution.

721^Kaldaus^black^Sure I will do my best :) 

yes and no, they can be great pets for some people, but they do require quite a bit of work to keep in the best conditions, they have quite a few downsides, and I would not recommend them to someone new to keeping animals, or someone who cannot devote quite a bit of time effort and money to there care. They can get quite large and are also quite dirty, so depending on your set up they can quickly outgrow it and require more and more space, for some people that is not a problem but for many it is. They can be a lot of fun I know one person who loves there ACF's and feeds them fried chicken LOL. 

Depends on where you live, they are illegal in several states and countries because they are very invasive and tend to take over if they are released, and as I stated above it can be very easy to get in over your head with them so they are often put into a local pond or similar situation which can be very bad, if you cant find out you can PM me with your location and I will do my best to find out :) 

Its kind of like anything else its responsible if you are willing to put in the effort and energy into it, and go into it knowing what is required of you. I do not feel it is responsible to simply purchase one on a whim and not be prepared for there needs, however that goes for most pets, and most things in life I suppose :) 

If they are legal in your area it should not be very difficult to find them at most local pet stores, even the larger chains will often carry them, you will often find them with a "glow" these have gotten an injection of a dye that will make them "glow" under a black light. However it only lasts a few months, and many people have issue with doing it as it is not necessary and can be harmful to the frog. You can normally find them for under $10, you might have to ask if they have the non injected variety, they are usually cheaper and it helps reduce to demand on the ones that have been injected. 

They can be really wonderful pets, and as frogs go are a fairly easy species to care for, however some of there other habits make them very difficult to keep for certain people, I would highly recommend you consider looking into another type of frog, my SO loves frogs and keeps several dozen of different kinds, the only frogs she has ever re-homed were ACF, now some people absolutely love them. I am not the kind of person who likes to tell others what to do but I would say, please research them as much as possible before you buy them, and if you do end up getting them and they are to much please find them a good home and dont just put them in the local pond. :) I hope this giant post helped LOL did not mean to write a book, hopefully it helps a bit, if you have any other questions I would be happy to try and help as best I can, best of luck to you and I hope you have a wonderful day!

721^Kaldaus^opiates^It really should be fine, the only thing I would suggest is to make sure to get his testosterone levels checked. One of the worst side effects that methadone is it can drastically lower testosterone levels. Opiates were used for a very long time as an anti depressant, it was not until more modern times that they have been so demonized. I know it can seem odd, especially to people that do not suffer from it, but when you find something that works really well, it can be very hard to be interested in trying something that you are not sure of. From what you have said, I doubt there will be any problems, in fact it will more than likely improve many aspects of his life. I know it can be scary and there are never any guarantees, but I hope what I have said has done a little to give you some hope and help calm your fears. I wish you and your SO the best, and truly hope that you are able to overcome this and have a wonderful life together. All the best to you and your family.

722^TowerCraneMan2^dreams^This happens a lot with me, I'm not a starseed but a star person meaning alien. 

When I meditate I also radiate with very powerful energy, and I have very lucid dreams. I can control my dreams, I'm mentoring my human sister on meditation and she's gained clairvoyance. She's amazing.

722^TowerCraneMan2^toys^My mother does that to me all the time, she treats me like shit on a stick, she is abusive. She humiliated me and my sister for wanting toys for Christmas, me and my sister were severely abused both physically and emotionally as kids and still are by our mother, 

And we never got to be kids at all, so me and my twin sister are abdl's because of it. I wanted an remote control tower crane for Christmas and my mom just bullied the shit out of Me for it and said degrading things like " are you gonna play with your cwane on the floor? In mock baby voice. 
You're too old you're 24, you're so immature, I'm not wasting my money on a piece of plastic for you to only play with it for 5 minutes" 

She eventually brought me the crane but was very mean to me when she saw me playing with it, I'm going to be a tower crane and mobile crane operator soon and I will continue buying model cranes and other construction machines to make my own construction site to play with at home. But me and my sister are going to be moving to Canada as soon as I do my apprenticeship for crane operator and immigrate there. We're going no contact with our mom and brother after that
 

She still bullies me if I want to buy a stuffed animal from the store, even if it's my own money. It's bullshit, she makes rude comments about me and my sister watching rugrats and spongebob, and blue's clues. When I'm out I'm building my own baby crane operator room with kids construction bedding, my own crib, a mobile with little cranes on it spinning above my head, and my whole room will have model cranes and construction machines on a site, and I'll have construction baby decor all over my room with kids and baby construction books too. It'll be such a nice little heaven to play and sleep in. I never got to be a baby boy, never was loved by a father, I am searching for a crane operator daddy or construction worker daddy that'll adopt me as his child when I move to Canada. Not just one of those adult baby hired dads, I want to find someone who will be my real dad for the rest of my life.

722^TowerCraneMan2^opiate^Peace to you shroomhead, I'm sorry your life was cut short, I've been there because I almost passed away from overdose suicide, but I was lucky because I lived. I wish you could've lived too. Rest in peace fellow opiate user, I was also a heavy fentanyl user before I got put on powerful subs for my chronic pain. 

But man I miss them fentanyl patches, especially with the rough life I got right now.

722^TowerCraneMan2^opiate^No I'm actually not human, I'm an ET. A star person, whatever people choose to call it. 

I'm not lying or pulling your leg when I tell you I have a different physiological system than you do. I usually get this temporal ignorance all the time with unspiritual humans. They never even think to the possibility of intelligent creatures all around them, there's plenty of star people everywhere when people find this out about me they're either in denial like you or they're actually open, I'd hoped that people who use drugs are higher aware of us than the close minded fucks walking around everyday. 

Guess you stepped on the minefield with me, hoping you'd find a fellow human, when I'm not even 1 percent human. 

My profile pic, that's my art, I'm a highly talented artist and that picture is what I really look like underneath the bioengineered human looking skin, and no don't argue about it with me, because it's futile if you do. I'm an electromagnus, I'm the only one here at the moment, now you can either be kind to me anyways despite my species difference or you're not worthy of my friendship if you can't accept me. I've been hurt really bad in my life and time here on earth and I will cut anybody I think is going to be another harmful person in my life. 

And no I'm not psychotic either, my mental health is good, just have PTSD from a bad childhood. 

You should be more open to the differences in people, not all are what you see or even think. If you can't accept it please leave because I've already been hurt enough. 

My kind can become opiate users as well, any creature with opioid receptors can become addicted, but it depends on the persons choices and Wether or not they can control themselves. Yes I have vulnerabilities just like you, some are different of course, I'm not immune to being sick physically or an addiction to something. I'm just a different kind of living creature that's all.

722^TowerCraneMan2^opioid^But my body Works way different than most, I have more opioid receptors than others and I can get loopy off buprenorphine and fentanyl together, I used to be on buprenorphine and hydrocodone at one time during pain treatment and in my body subs didn't block the dopey effect of hydros.

722^TowerCraneMan2^opium^Yeah well I plan on getting zircon gem pot leaf earrings when I move away from my mother's. I'm pro drug recreational use. Not just pot either, all drugs. I also plan on getting an opium poppy big tattoo across the front chest with a needle in the middle. I dgaf what ppl think.

722^TowerCraneMan2^opium^I plan on getting a tattoo of a tower crane on my shoulder, and a big tattoo of opium poppies on each side of the front of my chest and a large syringe of heroin in the middle of the poppies. And more tower and mobile cranes all over my back and body. 

And several spirit animal tattoos, my top being the polar bear. A baby polar bear in a diaper with a blanket and binkie sounds so cute and I'd put the baby polar bear with the other tattoos.

724^clitNdicksalad42069^opiates^Tbh i ain't got one. Cash wise fentanyl has got an advantage. It's very cheap and because it's so potent it's easy to ship all over the place. Opiates aren't cheap. It's a pricey addiction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
725^White_smoke2^opioid^Thank you for understanding not many do and I've tried gabapentin up to 3g with no effect lyrica I took 600mg and it worked well 

I have the same issue that kurt Cobain had a slight curve in the spine that doctors still to this day debate that caused his extreme abdominal pain 

Ive had my gallbladder removed appendix removed I now have chronic pancreatitis and the back problem and I keep getting told I'm not hurting then why do I hurt

And I also have an endorphin deficiency because when my mom was pregnant with me 20 years ago they didn't have the scientific knowledge today and back then when a woman was going into labor before 9 months they used morphine which is easily carried to the bbb of the infant In the womb and she told me she cant even count the amount of times doctors gave her morphine because of me like 30 to 50 times or more

Recent studies have shown that can cause an endorphin deficiency causing severe depression and severe pain for no reason unless the opioid receptors are filled with something 

Most studies have used low dose buprenorphine for that issue and it worked well as morphine but buprenorphine has a longer half life I've heard in some countries opioids and buprenorphine can be prescribed for depression I just wish America would fix its damn medical system I'm 20 with 30,000 dollars of medical bills easily because of my illnesses

725^White_smoke2^opium^I have chronic pancreatitis and fucked up nerves in my back my back has a type of curve that causes extreme pain tho I love the europhia from opiates I usually use opium up to 5gs so however much morphine codeine etc. I've had fent but it made me extremely sick in the hospital so they put me back on dilaudid.

Oxy is the only pill that helps pain as you know opium is not a pill.
I've tried morphine codeine opium oxy hydrocodone buprenorphine fentanyl demerol tramadol and imodium 

Tramadol was jack shit gay imodium at 44mg did more then 300mg tramadol 

When I'm not chasing the high I can take 20mg or so of oxy or 50mg of hydrocodone for a very nice relief of pain but when I want to get loaded and not feel anything I can use 50 to 60mg oxy probably 200mg hydrocodone but that shit expensive asf and all the tylenol but the morphine I can easily handle 500+mg at a time in the opium I've probably done almost a full gram of morphine before and I have never been so high even compared to the shots in the hospital iv of course 

But I've also used kratom found great pain relief in it I worked my way up to 32grams at once 5 to 6 times a day and still made a kilo last almost 4 months with 2 people using it and 2 people who stole at least 100grams out of the kilo I've heard kratom is just like methadone so I figured maybe that's what I should try.

But I only fear going to the MMC and being looked at like an addict but I guess I have no choice if I really need pain relief but I have read buprenorphine is the first go to but it doesn't work on me so would they write me methadone if I tested extremely positive for opiates or just subs

725^White_smoke2^opioid^I know it shitty people but I'm glad I did that pill and not my brother who has no opioid tolerance like codeine will get him lit up if it had my breathing fucked like that he would have died

725^White_smoke2^opioid^That's what I thought but I loved the fentanyl cut coke my friend gave me the most out of his bag because they couldn't handle the nasuea that fentanyl causes but yeah shit was crazy I imagine it's like a speedball when smoked crazy europhia without nodding for 10 minutes then it was holy hell I'm nodding and no one could tell but the legs were about 90 minutes the only opioid I've had with those legs was fent in the hospital 

We only had 2 bags like that and most of both ended up my nose but when 3 people are nodding on coke it isnt coke

725^White_smoke2^opiates^I just thought people would like to see them because they go great with opiates

725^White_smoke2^opioid^Holy shit I can't go to pain clinics because I smoke weed and because of thc they're like your an abuser no I'm a sufferer there is a difference I hate living in pain but dont want to use heroin but have thought about it because everyone says it's the most euphoric and pain reliever opioid but damn having to go to a methadone clinic every day I dont have a job or car yet because of my chronic conditions but if I had an effective pain medication I could work 80 hours a week or more I love working I hate suffering in pain and thanks to the USA thinking there's an opioid epidemic and chronic pain sufferer shouldn't be able to take daily pain meds I'm definitely going to think about it theres a clinic about 27 miles away but after 12 years of chronic pain I'm tried and ready to die unless someone takes care of the pain

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
726^AKFaida^black^I know that, but don‚Äôt you think he‚Äôd be more likely to get offered a manslaughter plea for 15 years if he had argued that he did it because he felt threatened (for example) instead of he did it just because he felt like murdering someone? I know they give out plea deals liberally but I have a hard time believing they‚Äôd offer a 15 yr manslaughter sentence to a black kid who murdered a middleclass white guy for shits and giggles. I‚Äôm thinking that kid would get the book thrown at him.

726^AKFaida^opiate^Rewatched the episode. The 100 lb girl you speak of went into the pharmacy with her mother who tried to explain that her daughter was chronically ill. In situations where you‚Äôve got people with long-term serious health problems it‚Äôs fairly common to see them have a parent or guardian act as their primary advocate. I would bet that they were maybe new patients of Cleggetts, referred from their previous physician, but by no means new to the medications or opiate naive. The girl was chronically ill, I‚Äôm pretty certain that her and her mother probably knew more about what drugs she needed and how they worked better than a random pharmacist who wasn‚Äôt familiar with their history. I have seen this with a couple family members who have suffered intractable pain from being chronically ill, and I had a very good friend who was sick like this as well (it‚Äôs worth mentioning that he committed suicide a couple weeks after his Dr announced he would no longer prescribe opiates).

726^AKFaida^opiates^Fentanyl will, in my experience, create a dependence faster than most other opiates and much worse withdrawal symptoms when you stop. The WDs can be a little shorter but much more intense.

726^AKFaida^opiates^There are so many different variables here...patients can have issues with malabsorption or genetic variations that ultimately play a large role in how well the drugs are metabolized, (low amounts mean they will need much higher doses to achieve relief) for example. And then you add tolerance to opiates that occurs over time and a patients weight doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean much.

726^AKFaida^opiate^There‚Äôs no known ceiling for opiate doses for pain treatment. You talk like that is a large dose but for many people it wouldn‚Äôt nearly be enough.

726^AKFaida^opiates^Every single person who enters their clinic will claim to be in enough pain to warrant opiates, and since pain is ultimately subjective you can‚Äôt prove that they aren‚Äôt suffering. If you go to a clinic and claim to be in pain then that‚Äôs on you, and I know that some drs will believe stories that others won‚Äôt. If she forced them it‚Äôd be diffferent, but. you can‚Äôt prove that she didn‚Äôt actually believe every patient she prescribed for when it comes down to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
727^grocedog^opiates^It‚Äôs crazy how alcohol is popular and causes so much damage to your body and hangovers. Opiates that are pharmaceutical grade cause no damage to your body and no hangover for the most part. 

What they do to your brain and receptors is a different story I‚Äôd you are addicted,  but it‚Äôs more reversible than alcohols effects

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
728^CSX302^black^No black swirlies, i feel like i got slight tunnel vision the one time. I get a strong feeling like something is wrong

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
729^liz79v^opioid^Hey I'm day 20 today methadone withdrawal cold turkey 70 mg your withdrawal should be much easier on a short-acting opioid if you get restless leg one thing I did this time through the withdrawal I had no restless leg syndrome electrolytes with Himalayan salt I had not one restless leg I have everything else hang in there this will pass quick you're doing the right thing.. awesome job hang in there it will pass is going to mess with your mind and everything else two weeks on a short-acting opioid the minds even okay it's a month or two-month on something like methadone... if you're suffering on something like that if you take not trying to give you bad advice  10 Imodium 2 milligram pills nothing else some people say if you take like Zantac or something it crosses the blood-brain barrier you don't need to do that and that's much worse for your heart but if you just take 10 of those preferably on an empty stomach wait two or three hours you will feel a lot better just do it for like three or four days you don't want to get messed up with that stuff and it's nice to go to the bathroom eventually but it really will help you

729^liz79v^opioid^ I'm on day 20 Cold Turkey 70 mg I did this once before and I'm never doing it again but last time it was much much worse last time I used the Kratom this time I didn't I think it either prolonged it at least for me or actually made me feel sicker... I'm speak to text sorry about punctuation but this time I ordered it was really cheap on Amazon electrolytes with Himalayan salt it has like just a little bit of caffeine in it I know that they say caffeine is bad but I would take it with a thiamine  with magnesium at the same time just to counter balance anxiety with the caffeine it just worked wonders it's only thing I did different....  I had absolutely not one restless leg not one .....I got all the other symptoms though still waking up sweaty clammy and day 7 through 9 was an absolute Nightmare and at the two-week Mark at day 14 you go through a regular short-acting opioid withdrawal for like 3 days again and you think you've gone backwards but then you wake up on the fourth day of that after 2 weeks and feel better it's weird.... now it's the mental part too... oh the web we weave hang in there I'm with you ...;)

729^liz79v^opiates^I've been on up to 40 at the time that I tried other opiates and it blocks it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
730^Shadyaku69^opiate^Yeah; but it reaches the point of dysphoria which i don't know if u had experienced i got My bong by My side ; but it's something about those opiate dreams and shadows that make me miss ; the euphoria ; the all not seeing eye of the situation must of us are caught up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
731^BostonKyrieParty^opium^I probably will continue to smoke a lot of weed like I used to. I've been able to be sober two separate x. Once for 28 months and once for 14 since this all began at 17. I'm 29 now. I just hate being gripped by the throat at something. I just hate bupe and methadone and honestly am too much of a pussy to go cold turkey so i got 12 grams of opium and 3800 mg of EX tramadol after I run out of my last bit of dope i ever want to do Sunday morning. I know it's not an excuse but instead of seeking therapy or healthy coping mechanisms when my fiance died, i relapsed.

731^BostonKyrieParty^opium^I have like grade A opium from another country tested and tried. I just don't want to be sick is all. Not high

731^BostonKyrieParty^opium^Yes. But what would be the amount I would use because I have never taken opium in my life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
732^Drenarka^opiates^Unfortunatly oxycodone and other opiates aren't popular at all in my country, for pain treatment doctors give you mainly tramadol / codeine or morphine but very very rarely oxycodone, and I don't even think other opiates like hydrocodone, oxymorphone etc .. are sold at all where I live

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
733^dollardazee^opiates^I‚Äôve got some clonazepam and kratom as well but I still can‚Äôt sleep in withdrawl despite the fact I‚Äôm on Kratom and clonazepam. So I thought I could just save those meds for the day and take the seroquel at night for sleep. I‚Äôm trying to stock up on comfort meds for when I inevitable go through withdrawl again. I‚Äôm an insomniac though with or without opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
734^throwaway6836184759^opiates^I'm so happy that is resulted in you getting clean. I have a strong love for mushrooms and haven't even done them for 9 years but 9 years ago I wasn't addicted to opiates. I do truly think it is the answer for me. I know some may say it's replacing one drug with another but I personally don't see mushrooms as a drug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
735^caden_g59^chocolate^Pizza, wings, chocolate, peppers, any lunch meat, cheese (depending what it's with/on), smoked salmon...just to name a few

735^caden_g59^black^She's in a better place now brother watching over you everyday, just know that. 

Just be prepared tho cause the wrist and hands are pretty painful so taking a bar is a good move cause it makes it go by so much faster. I was there for 4 hours today just to get it finished (after a 2 hour outline sesh) and it seemed like an hour no shit. I wouldn't take enough to black out tho cause they'll probably kick you out if you're too fucked up haha. 

Be safe my guy and be strong

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
736^Hezzadee^opiates^I talent many opiates after thirty to 40mg forty it seems to just add.to the sedaroom.me a bit of euphoria morphine and heroin. If. Took away the oxy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
737^mskblast^opiate^if u take an opiate  before or after u bang a suboxone you will want to die.
If you are going to bang them u must make sure you haven‚Äôt done any opiates.
Or just bang subutex which doesn‚Äôt contain nalaxone which won‚Äôt throw you in PW.

737^mskblast^opiates^NO IT DOESNT. I shot subutex for years alongside shooting all types of opiates with it.
You are thinking of suboxone. Which contains nalaxone, when which shot will
Throw you into PW. I have done it before.
It‚Äôs the naloxone.... not anything else...
Where you did you get your info from?

737^mskblast^opiate^Yes because you weened down correctly ,
But try banging 8 16 mg every other day for more than a year  then within 2 weeks ween from that and jump, it is the worst wd out of any opiate I‚Äôve dealt with

737^mskblast^opiate^Are you living under a rock my friend. Have you heard of Kratom? Go to your headshop and get some good quality Kratom (red strains) the stimulate the opiate receptors. It will relieve ALL of your withdrawal symptoms. Start with 3-4 grams.  Take it for a few weeks until you have no more withdrawal symptoms and then you can stop taking Kratom. No there won‚Äôt be any withdrawals from Kratom. Alongside buy an amino acid supplement like dhea or l-tyrosine 1000mg 2000mg a day to promote natural productivity of dopamine in the body. This is the best advice you will get. Take it and run with it. I shot subutex 8s for years and had a very high tolerance and I‚Äôm getting off of subs now with Kratom. Smooth sailing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
738^Benzois^opiates^If you can afford it you‚Äôre not getting ripped of. Money isn‚Äôt an issue so thankfully I can support my habit without ever having to worry about going broke due to my family and father who is a hedge fund manager. I was raised around money being disposable and having every luxury life has to offer. My father is a huge enabler.

With that being said I prefer prescription opiates over heroin due to the authenticity and reliability. Heroin has been passed through too many hands and just a dirty fucking drug compared to the roxy 15s and 30s, opana 10s, diludad, Anything I fucking want really.

I‚Äôve used heroin a handful of times and the high was okay but I will choose prescription pills any day over H. It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse to have this type of disposable income because I literally can go anywhere in the world and buy/do whatever the fuck I want when I want and I‚Äôm still not happy.

738^Benzois^opiate^I‚Äôm prescribed 2mg kpins twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. I‚Äôm also prescribed 20mg adderall ir twice a day. I just bought the oxy for fun and I‚Äôm not prescribed but I have a high opiate tolerance. Atleast 60-90mg a day of oxy. Would mixing the three just not be worth it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
739^bruiseyed^opiates^I would say it is probably mildly dangerous tbh.. Depending on how much you‚Äôre lifting. I am a gymnast/mild contortionist and have injured myself stretching on opiates before, because I don‚Äôt feel the pain I should (and need to, as an indicator of my body‚Äôs limits!) and go too hard. 
Just don‚Äôt over-exert yourself without realizing. Stick to what you know you‚Äôre capable of sober. 
I have also been able to give amazing performance on opiates, but it comes at a cost. Feeling like all my tendons are on fire the next day! Or.. a few weeks of physical therapy and (((more opiates))) for a hip injury ü§™

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
740^scxtty42^opiate^Idk why this is on r/pillhead but I enjoy it! üòÇ

Dude probably has some benzo or opiate munchies rn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
741^psychonotes^black^You can fit like 100mg/ml... Be VERY careful and space it out.you can black out quick and easy repeatedly over a single night

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
742^eternal_n0mad^opiate^I completely agree lol. Opiate purist. I can get down with that. It's too magical to fuck up with anything else.

742^eternal_n0mad^opiates^Cocaine I always end up rambling about how much I love everybody

Opiates would be the least sappy, when I'm on opiates I want to be left the fuck alone in my house by myself with no sound happening at all

742^eternal_n0mad^opiate^I'm keeping the opiate dose low, like 12.5mg oxycodone. And I took like .5mg clonazolam.

742^eternal_n0mad^opiate^Great! I did take the benzo first, so hopefully I get all the euphoria from the opiate!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
743^user2310321^opiates^A majority of people will nod from 7.5 mg. This question gets asked everyday and a majority of the time they take 15mg+ and come back with an edit describing the shitty experience they had. 

It may happen where a first timer takes a lot but is lucky enough to not know what to feel so they don‚Äôt experience the negative and positives of opiates. 

My first time I did 40mg oxy and I didn‚Äôt know what to feel and it was a whatever experience, but after that I did it again but with 25mg and I was vomiting and could hardly breathe but I did also feel amazing on the come up cause I knew what it was gonna feel like 

Ofc some ppl will be more tolerant to opiates but majority aren‚Äôt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
744^Enemy_Within^black^A few years ago my family moved from Pennsylvania to Wrightsville, NC. I was the last to leave our apartment in PA to move down and drove my car through the night to avoid heavy traffic. There‚Äôs a good stretch of road in NC, when you‚Äôre headed towards wilmington, that has very few exits. Nothing but straight highway. It was a very bright night and I remember it was one of the first times I had seen meteors because we had only ever lived near big cities. Anyway I don‚Äôt see many other cars through the night but eventually I get behind this large semi. Guys going at a pretty decent clip and he‚Äôs about one-two football pitches ahead of me. All of a sudden I see him slowly start drifting to the right, as if to take an exit. I watch his taillights slowly fade into the black of thick trees. Don‚Äôt think much about it but just out of curiosity I‚Äôm looking for the exit to get an idea how far away I am. Only thing is one never appears. Nothing, no exit, no turn off, no nothing. Turned my brights on to look for a trail thinking maybe I should call 911. Never saw anything. Weirdest feeling I had in a long time. Spent the next week searching for semi crash online in our area and nothing. Really strange stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
745^HelpSlipFrank85^opiates^I do get opiates prescribed pretty easily since I cant take any kind of NSAID like ibuprofen or aleve. I know that a lot of people would be envious of the ease in which I get my meds, but I hate them. I only take 30 to 40 mg of percocet a day. What they would not be envious of is having gout in almost every single joint. The pain is something I cant even put into words. I've spoken to women who have told me childbirth was easier than chronic gout attacks. It's a horrible pain that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
746^Delicious_Wolf^black^This kinda hits close to home. Just this past thanksgiving (the night before) I found my uncle dead from suicide in my parents basement,in the most horrific way possible (the details would only haunt you if I told you.) he was a recovering addict and after he had gotten sober, his mental health literally just took a dive and within about 18 months of removing the drugs and alcohol, he was just a shell of the person he once was. What was spooky, is that in the two weeks prior to the incident, I would come home (I had moved back to my parents to help them with my uncle for a little while) and he would just be standing in a completely pitch black room, staring into the abyss. (We live on top of a mountain on a lake and it is pitch black up here because there is zero light pollution) .... about 3-4 days before the incident, he kept asking me if I was scared that people (cops,fbi,cia etc..) are listening to my phone calls and that I need to be very careful when I‚Äôm using the phone and so on. I would ask him what he meant, did he hear something etc... and then he would abruptly change the conversation but then return a few hours later with the same comments.... sadly, I think he was hearing voices and that‚Äôs ultimately what pushed him to do what he did. We notified his dr numerous times before this happened and they literally did absolutely nothing. He was telling the dr ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having bad thoughts etc‚Äù and all they did was say....‚Äùdo you think you need to go back to the hospital‚Äù?.... and of course, you already know why his answer was. And because it was a state program.... they just didn‚Äôt give a shit at all.....we live in a fucked up world. That fucked me up bad for a few weeks...crazy

748^YJ7hundo^dreams^Naa I don‚Äôt have dreams but when I sip I get dreams I sipped 2 days in a row and had two dreams even was late to college the first day

749^DaDruid^opiate^üòÇ I used to be a homeless heroin addict. Forgive me for enjoying a self moderating lesser opiate from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
750^cokeadile^opiates^Yes...I realize that opiates are for pain management/physical health and not mental health. Yes I also realize you can get high off them I am a recovering addict from both heroin and pharmaceutical opiates. Yes, I realize some ‚Äúmental health‚Äù medication you can get high off (such as benzos) but by mental health I meant the anti depressants and anti psychotic.

750^cokeadile^opiate^Bro you get the point I‚Äôm trying to make. It‚Äôs like an anti depressant. For mental health but you can‚Äôt get high like as in a benzo or opiate high. Good to know tho thanks.

750^cokeadile^black^‚ÄúI prefer the orange's with the black O-see
Take to where you can, I move about you see
Some people mellow down in a needle and shoot 'em up. Buy I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck‚Äù ....that line of the song confused me. I thought you couldn‚Äôt get high off it bc it‚Äôs for mental health or something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
751^JMGMiles^opiates^Not trying to preach at all. Not saying anyone should quit or keep going. But, no one has a machine that will be giving them a lifetime supply of opiates, and if  you've never gotten to the point where you want to quit, you will.

Not trying to be a downer, its the way it is with heroin. 

But again, I'm not trying to force anyone to heed my words or make anyone feel bad. If nothing else, its still a good song.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
752^jthehonestchemist^china^100k is the ‚Äúlikely ‚Äú number due to China not being very forthcoming about anything. It‚Äôs more around 12k ‚Äúconfirmed
The # of deaths you have is correct for the ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù number though.

752^jthehonestchemist^china^Yeah well Canada is doing trials with o-dsmt now! Because of the reduced risks of seizure. 
The 2-methyl-ap-237 just has 2 methyl rings attached to ap-237( which was used for cancer patients in China from the 70s to the late 90s I believe)

753^alcaeus93^black^Looks like you have both switch legs from your 3 wire on one switch. Red wire to first switch black too second. Your other romex in your switch box is your hot. Tap your nuetrals together, pigtail 2 hot legs off your black wire for both switchs.

753^alcaeus93^black^Your within code to backfeed your disposal outlet to a switch. I've never used the switch/outlet duplex but the houses I rough I'n everyday for my company I run a whip(12-2) out of my disposal box, phase the nuetral with black tape to show it's hot and that will be your 2 hots in your switch box

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
754^Nothing_is_Easy^opiate^Obviously something about me or my videos rubs you the wrong way, and I'm sorry for that. My intention was never to offend you, or make you uncomfortable in any way. I am a recovering opiate addict and this is how I am dealing with it. All I hope is that I can somehow help someone else in the process.

754^Nothing_is_Easy^opiate^Groan. I didnt add the word "just" in front of psychological, because I knew that most normal humans take the context into consideration when reading words. I was responding to the claim the video makes that opiate addiction is purely psychological. I was saying that is bullshit. Everything has a psychological component. EVERYTHING. Most people dont need that spelled out for them.

754^Nothing_is_Easy^black^Just because you see things in black and white, that doesnt mean it was intended that way. Perhaps someday you will understand that.

754^Nothing_is_Easy^opiates^Of course. Addiction to opiates isnt psychological, its physical. We've known that for 200 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
755^marcoB12c^opium^I have never smoked it (successfully), but I ate a good chunk of it in India and woah what amazing opium dreams. Both me and my friend had the same kind of dreams, wide open wavy fields of green grass and wild flowers and blue skies. It was weird because the dreams changed like every few seconds but was still the best thing ever.
Woke up the next day feeling more refreshed than ever before.

755^marcoB12c^opiate^In my experience benzos take away the euphoria if taken while high on an opiate. But if I already took some benzos and then the opiate I would get all euphoria plus the extra sedation from the benzo.

755^marcoB12c^opiate^An update:

I got them today and they are in fact capsules with tiny balls/pellets inside. Very easy to empty, crush and snort. Like you said with Dilaudids, like they were made for snorting.

And I have to say it was probably the best opiate high I've experienced. I'm not a big fan of heroin, I think it's really overrated. My last favorite were Oxy and Morphine combo (orally). But Hydromorphone intranasal is better in my opinion. Roughly the same duration as oral Oxy. Which is quite short, like 2 hours then a mild "afterglow".

I started with maybe 1,5mg, felt the come-up then nothing more. Took maybe 3mg more less than an hour later and got cozy.
Now, several hours later I have a mild headache. But it's not too bad.

755^marcoB12c^opiate^These aren't Dilaudid so they won't be made up of the same setting. So possibly they won't be snortable. Like some manufacturers of Oxy make their pills non-snortable with some of their binders and fillers.

I think I'll try a small bit of the pill, crush it and snort. Just to see if that works. Otherwise my other only option is boofing. Boofing Morphine in my past has been a waste so I have some training to do. Wouldn't want to waste these Hydros for 35 bucks a piece. They're really hard to come by where I live so they're kind of a luxury opiate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
756^fad94^opium^Jesus christ. Im not trying to refine it into morphine. I just asked how opium compares to hydro and oxy because I know what those feel like. I meant like chandu...

756^fad94^black^The laurens grape seeds I got are black, the queens were white/tan. Dark purple sounds amazing, any pics?

756^fad94^opiate^Yeah that's one of the teks Ive read. It seemed too easy, like I was missing something. Good to know its pretty doable. But like I said, Im looking to make something more traditional like Chandu or something I can put on a bowl.

Im not a regular opiate user so I dont have much of a tolerance. Opiates aren't my thing but Id like to have some around for when the mood strikes me or if I accidentally hurt myself.

757^artkratom^opiate^kratom + gabapentin for acute withdrawal and then taper off both. very easy to get a script of gabapentin. I literally just asked my pdoc for one for opiate withdrawal and he gave it to me. or just say that you've been on it before for anxiety or some shit and it helped

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
758^hardrocker61^opiates^What I meant was that in particular with opiates especially opioids/painkillers like hydrocodone and oxycodone for me unlike other drugs and alcohol, when I found a substance that did so many things such as increasing my energy, confidence, self esteem,motivation, libido and decreasing my pain, anxiety and depression, (basically making me feel like SUPERMAN), it was so hard to stop taking it. I have found nothing else since that comes close to doing all those things, this is what I meant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
759^AaronNazzy^opiates^stims are my favorite honestly. i‚Äôve fucked with opiates and they never got me feelin as good as stims. something about the energy and clean feel good high from em that i love. plus it‚Äôs super fun to get shit done vs just falling asleep on downers smh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
760^BeyondPsycho69^black^It builds fast, and drops fast too... so like you can take 4mg - 6mg whatever like everyday. You‚Äôll black out sometimes, or most times in my experience. Then you go through some really bad withdrawals. And 1mg can hit hard. Maybe that‚Äôs just my experience, but also what my friends say as well. 

Also it is extremely addictive and can lead to bad things... I‚Äôm personally trying very hard to get myself off them but it‚Äôs so hard...

760^BeyondPsycho69^opiate^I tried it once, I fell in love, but had to pull away... somethings are too good to be true, and hearing from people in active addiction to recovery that‚Äôs seems like the case. I‚Äôm an opiate pill addict, it‚Äôs expensive, but manageable... but the thought of heroin again is always there... so i dont know your gonna get mixed reviews, nobody will stop you and nobody should force you.

760^BeyondPsycho69^opiate^I have a high tolerance to benzodiazepines, I use to mix them a lot and with opiates and alcohol. Now I mainly use them for the minor withdrawal symptoms I get between doses of opiates and I try to only use them when my anxiety level is pretty much unbearable. I always keep some Xanax and K-pins if I smoke weed (which is very occasional), drink, or go on opiate binges. They make life much easier that‚Äôs for sure. 

My favorite thing to do is purposely not eat before taking any opiate, making them hit harder and stronger. Then keep a Xanax for when the come down starts from extended opiate use. 

Tramadol is a weird drug, but it did the trick with helping my pain and even gave me a nice high, except it does give me extreme dry mouth and nausea. 

I guess my biggest problem isn‚Äôt a super high opiate tolerance, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm not effected by certain pain meds and very susceptible to benzodiazepines and SSRI‚Äôs. I‚Äôm just hoping I can find a nice opiate that works for me consistently without having to turn to heroin. I am willing to try diluadid again, does anyone have suggestions on the most effective way to get the best high from them? 

Also does anyone have suggestions on how to take OcyContin that have the XR wax on them? 

I am always looking for the most effective way to dose on any opiates I can get. So I appreciate all the tips and tricks everyone has to offer. And I am happy to share my experience and knowledge. Being able to tell my story and hear others is quite nice.

760^BeyondPsycho69^opiates^I have tried diluaded a few times but it has yet to work on me. I honestly have no idea why. I‚Äôve been around people that take 8mg and start nodding out and I don‚Äôt even feel a buzz after taking 16mg. Even morphine I have to take at least 60 mg to even feel something. But I can take 20-40 mg hydrocodone or oxycodone and get a decent high. 

I am a natural Redhead, and have read about certain medication, especially pain meds that I need much more of to feel the same to what everyone else feels. I know I need extra anesthesia if I go under for surgery and double what normal people need at the dentist for Novocain. 

I guess I just want to find something that works for me, it can be really frustrating when you‚Äôre with some friends that take opiates and you take twice as much and still don‚Äôt feel anything... 

I don‚Äôt want to do heroin, but it would be nice to have something that actually gets me high...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
761^Explorer427^opiates^If you are mainly trying to feel the effects of codeine but  you also wanna throw benzos into the mix, then does moderately on codeine like you would and slowly mix in the benzos until u feel right, with a high tolerance to benzos I would still go slow on it. Codeine alone is good at moderat doses but for some people they also would add a mix of benzos, I find that it diminishes the opiates ever so slightly, every one's got a different reaction to these combos. Enjoy yourself man, stay safe!

761^Explorer427^opiates^What about combinging opiates with other opiates, does it potentiate it? Does it overlap one another and what was your favorite only opiates combo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
762^contemplatethefall^opiate^I went through the same exact thing after my first and only relapse. I started out after getting clean from heroin to doing OP 80s. 

For the first few weeks (or even a month/month and a half) I didn‚Äôt experience physical withdrawals, but I experienced mental ones. I would wake up and feel sad and depressed without them and immediately run to my dealer to get more OP 80s to feel happy. 

Of course this eventually got to the point where I was experiencing physical withdrawals without them and led me back into a full-blown heroin addiction that was far worse than the one I had previously gotten clean from. And for full disclosure, I had actually stayed clean for upwards of six months or more without turning to the OP 80s (I wasn‚Äôt unhappy or experiencing PAWS, I just had a little extra money and foolishly thought that I could dabble without getting back into a bad situation). 

**My biggest recommendation is to exercise. Go to the gym, blast music, enjoy yourself as much as possible. Be around safe, supportive, loving friends and family if possible. Talk to people. If you have insurance or can afford going to see an addictions therapist, I highly recommend that. But otherwise, a healthy diet, an exercise regimen, and a structured daily life with limited downtime really does help ease that opiate sadness. I really credit those things as the reason I didn‚Äôt experience any PAWS after getting clean.**

If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I wish you the best of luck.‚ù§Ô∏è

762^contemplatethefall^opiate^Thank u so much for the info! I‚Äôm all the way in PA on the east coast or I would totally hit u up for recommendationsüòä 

I‚Äôve never heard of house detoxes, I‚Äôm only looking into hospital detoxes. My main concern is the level of care that different facilities provide if that makes sense. For example, I‚Äôve heard horror stories about facilities that are totally understaffed as far as residential doctors go, that as a result leaves some patients without proper medication doses & things of the like. 

I‚Äôm also curious to see if anyone out there has been to a detox center that provides things like IV fluids for severely dehydrated patients as well as centers that tailor a medication regimen to a patient‚Äôs specific needs (for example, tailoring medication for a patient that is experiencing high blood pressure & the symptoms that come with it to help combat said symptoms) as opposed to centers that do a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù treatment (i.e. subutex for opiate patients, pregab for benzo patients, etc).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
763^purpletypepersons^opioid^The best source of information would be the American Kratom Association. They have been working on creating a system that ensures good quality control. The brands that have met standard are listed on the website, and the price can vary by brand. It's not expensive compared to prescription medication. 

It's available at smoke shops but I'd stick with a certified pure brand. I did try two smoke shop brands and they both worked well, so that was good.

In Georgia it's legal. There's something called the Kratom Protection Act that gives Georgia and a few other states more structured protections in law and quality regulations. 

As far as pain Doctors go... currently that's a real mixed bag. Some of them understand how helpful it is, not just to reduce cravings for heroin but also to treat severe pain. Other Doctors think it IS like heroin, and I'm not sure why. 

My experience has been very positive. When I take Kratom I can sit and work with my computer, and not be distracted by my back pain. I can sit on the floor and watch a movie; I can't  do that without it. 

From what I've read some people with very severe pain are able to get out of the bed and do basic things, or even continue working when they take it. The benefits of helping those with opioid dependency are well documented but not something I'm personally familiar with.

With the population advancing in age and poor healtcare we really need it. It just drives me crazy that it's available and could help so many people but very few know about it. There's a lot of misinformation muddling things as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
764^soberbee123^opiate^I‚Äôve been dealing with this for 10 years... so I‚Äôm all too aware of the depth of deception he‚Äôll sink to to cover his addiction. I‚Äôve heard the expression ‚Äúan alcoholic will steal money out of your wallet and lie about it... but an addict will steal your wallet and then help you look for it‚Äù.  It really resonates with me. Kratom is just his new scapegoat that I know very little about. 

Opiate addiction is a heavy load, and I respect anyone who is fighting the good fight. I know it‚Äôs not easy. 

Thanks for your insight... really appreciate it...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
765^addict4all^opiate^I‚Äôm doing tar rn for exactly the same reason. Had been like a month since I had pills but I needed that opiate relief.  So yeah I was also worried about fent. 

Sounds like smoking is your option. I did try a dabs rig to smoke my tar (inspired by OPs here on reddit) but it was wildly unsuccessful...never been skilled at dabs anyway. I should figure it out tho. After 3 days of smoking tar on foil, my lungs are ready to jump out and leave my body. Also smoke a pack of cigs a day. Poor lil babies.

765^addict4all^opiate^Well if you‚Äôre getting pills you‚Äôd need to crush the entire thing and mix it to test for fent. So I dunno what‚Äôs best way to use after if not snorting. I‚Äôm a snorter or smoker of pills but anytime I smoked pills it‚Äôs keeping it whole and running it. Yes on foil for me. Prob not a good idea as aluminum does vaporize with heat. I‚Äôm not known for good health decisions lol
Maybe just eat the powder? Or I‚Äôve heard of people mixing with water and dripping that into their nostrils. Like I believe a cold water extraction so the opiate dissolves and the fillers drop to the bottom. And then get a syringe without needle and drip that into your nose holes. Less trauma to the nose that way but given your nasal history I‚Äôm not sure if even the liquid would be a good/bad idea. But likely better than powder.

765^addict4all^opiates^So true about the 80s lol I can‚Äôt believe I started using opiates with those in high school and didn‚Äôt OD/die.

765^addict4all^black^Wassup with this numbering system? It‚Äôs just black tar. Ended up getting a deal and got a gram for $60

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
766^Maksy123^opiate^Yeah I decided today is my last day of it, and I do have a former bad opiate habbit!! Kratom isnt even good!!! The high isnt worth the trouble whats so ever!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
767^drbea^opiates^Yep people are just haters. Personally kratom has helped me a lot, still gives me a pretty good buzz, and for the most part keeps me off H. I still have some binges here and there and even after the binges I feel the kratom. So dont knock it cause it doesn't work for YOU. "Isnt worth the search" maybe for you, but its helped a LOT of people so saying it isn't worth it is just ignorant. Tbh I'd way rather be on kratom as my management drug over subs or methadone any day. Oh well jokes on you I can get a kilo and last me a month or two. Its brought up in this sub because for a lot of ppl it's a legit way to get off opiates or stay off them, or just using it recreationally. A very affordable way at that.

767^drbea^opiate^Dont take kratom expecting to feel the same exact effects as a real opiate like oxy..you might feel somewhat similar effects but itll never be the exact same, but it might he somewhat close. So dont just go taking huge amounts to feel more of an effect, you need to experiment to find your own personal dose.

767^drbea^opiate^Smh no not only for WD....I take it every day and still get a decent high from it, but it's a different kind of high. Reminiscent of a low-mid opiate dose mixed with some upper pep. But still it's own thing.

767^drbea^opiates^Yes...I did h for 3+ years and getting off with kratom was a breeze, and after a few days when my body got used to the kratom it would STILL get me pretty buzzed if it took enough, and I was doing up to .35 per shot multiple times a day. So yes even after years of abuse it still worked great for me and gave a decent high, you have to experiment to find your own personal dose and give it a few days if you're coming off of real opiates. Idk if this is true but I feel like the real opiates have to get kicked off the receptors first before you're able to feel much which might be why it takes a few days for effect.

767^drbea^opiate^Kratom for sure. Ppl say "hurr if you have a tolerance you wont feel much" which is a load of shit, it depends on the person ofc but for me I used h heavy for 3+ years, made the switch to kratom, gave me a decent buzz then and still does now. It won't feel exactly like a real opiate but it's fairly reminiscent. You just have to experiment and find out what dose and strains work for you, just buy from an online vendor not locally. Might take a few days for you to feel much though, especially coming off of a habit.

767^drbea^opiates^Yeah you're right, everyone's different but I feel like if ppl actually gave it a chance they would like it. Not just taking a dose or two and being like it does nothing..more like a few days at least. Especially if you're coming off opiates those receptors need a bit to clear up for the kratom to bind better. I just personally feel it's much better to be on a semi opioid like kratom over a full one like other maintenance drugs (plus the fact it gets me pretty high still) but I'm not knocking whatever works for people.

767^drbea^opiate^Eh not neccesarily. It depends on the person etc but for me I think it helps with anxiety/being happy/work etc. Like I'll still get decent euphoria from it just nowhere near a real opiate.

767^drbea^opiate^"Probably won't feel nothing" wrong. I used for YEARS and it still gives me a pretty good buzz and is great for cravings etc. Dont be expecting a crazy full opiate high cause that's not what you're gonna get. People push it on addicts for a REASON. It's not exactly suboxone or methadone but IMO far superior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
768^Milqy^opiate^That‚Äôs badass of you. I have a friend who had to have his leg amputated due to getting pinned in between 2 vehicles...he‚Äôs an opiate addict and he hates people judging him so at first of course he needed painkillers but within a week or 2 he decided to wean off of them.

768^Milqy^opiates^Sadly I cannot imagine a world without opiates. What would life even be for active users?
Like this is my exact thinking. You pulled some words from my brain.
I hate my life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
769^aussiecunt123^black^Strength or type of pill or tolerance has nothing to do with the question


Only had a few puffs n thought this is stupid ill just eat it


Does oxy get 100% destroyed by smoking a few small puffs or do u need to smoke it to a black mark on the foil for it to be gone

769^aussiecunt123^opiate^I said probs bullshit because its some shit I heard of some fuckhead 

Telling me to get help why the fuck are you going around commenting on all my shit.


Im from sydney australia, idk where your from but I doubt you know anything about drugs here

Ive had bars that were just straight fentanyl

You cant mistake that opiate feeling 

I doubt the ones im talking about had fent in em I took his word with a grain of salt but to say there is no fentanyl pressed bars is bullshit, maybe where YOUR from but not where IM from.

769^aussiecunt123^black^It wouldnt black you out


But even with a tolerence it makes your memory super fucking hazy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
770^m0rphinedrip^opiate^It all started out with a fucked up childhood involving sexual abuse and then when my dad died when I was 15 (I was a daddy‚Äôs girl), I just went off the rails. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I inherited my dads addictive genes. He was also an opiate addict.
I started with low dose painkillers and then just worked my way up the chain. I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs now and my partner and I just realized we‚Äôve been using opiates for 5 years. Not everyday, consistently but we‚Äôve had our fair share of withdrawals and junkie moments. We‚Äôre trying to get clean but we‚Äôre in a horrible spot in our lives and just can‚Äôt seem to get out of it. We keep relapsing every week. I want to stop but this has been one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had/tried to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
771^cyber-shits^opiate^I live in north of brazil and here doesn't have an opiate culture at all 
I know just five peoples that used morphine constantly in my city and it's a big city
In the south of the country has H but i didn't have the  oportunity to travel to there yet :-(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
772^RecreationalAV^china^A few other products I order that are supplied by China are already running short/ sold out on some vendors websites. 

Don‚Äôt know if kratom is gonna be effected the same way, but the virus is already causing problems w other nootropics/ products

772^RecreationalAV^opiate^It‚Äôs not really the lack of sleep so much, although getting some would be nice. I‚Äôve been an IV heroin user for about a decade, and WD so many times that they are just god awful now. Due to ‚Äúkindling effect‚Äù they get worse each time. So now I end up throwing up every 20 mins or so for 4 days, along with the RLS and anxiety and hot cold. 

Like the first 15 times I quit any opiate CT was a walk in the park compared to how it is for me now 50+ times later. My body is just so used to having them

I want to quit but I suffered a debilitating injury where I had to learn to walk again and going any appreciable distance hurts sooo bad
And because of my previous use Drs won‚Äôt give me any benzos/opiates/gaba. I‚Äôm told to just take IBUPROFEN

772^RecreationalAV^opiate^I dunno. Just that it‚Äôs a morphinian compound and has action at the kappa/delta opiate receptors?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
773^DepressedDuck3^opiates^I‚Äôd recommend Tramadol instead of Oxy for depression since Tramadol works as an SNRI. When I used to fuck around with drugs trying to numb my depression I found that tramadol worked the best and I didn‚Äôt get physically addicted to it as easy compared to other opiates. 

Good luck!

773^DepressedDuck3^opiate^I feel you man, it really sucks, though at the end of the summer I felt like my depression just lifted and I suddenly was happy, I quit all drugs for a month or 2, started taking mirtazapine which I only took for 2-3 weeks because it gave me such severe munchies lol. Though time passed I perused my druggie lifestyle and shit was really good tbh, I went from being suicidal for about 4 years to experiencing REAL HAPPINESS and I didn‚Äôt even know why. Though about a month ago shit got bad again, I‚Äôm starting to feel slightly depressed again and my anxiety is starting to come back, could it be because of my horrible HPPD? I dunno.

But I can tell you that no substance will ever make me experience that intense happiness I had for those amazing 6 months, no opiate noir stimulant will ever be comparable to that feeling. So homie, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with feeing depressed and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with doing drugs to feel better, in fact I probably wouldn‚Äôt be here today if it wasn‚Äôt for benzos and opiates, but don‚Äôt ever let the drugs take over as I did, I was addicted to percs, Xanax, coke and speed when I was 15, my life was circulating around drugs, I didn‚Äôt think about anything other than drugs and I though that me popping more xans would solve all of my problems, but what really had a impact on me was that I started to work out, I started to socialized more with people around and tried my best to ‚Äúfix‚Äù myself and become a normal person that didn‚Äôt depend on drugs. 

Never stop trying, never let the drugs define you and if you‚Äôre starting to feel more energized, go to the gym even if you feel like you CANT. Drugs won‚Äôt solve anything but they can help you get the energy and motivation to get happy fr.

I‚Äôm pretty fucked Rn sorry if it‚Äôs hard to understand lol but man if you ever feel like you need advice or if you just want to talk, DM me!

773^DepressedDuck3^opiate^Amazing! :) clonazepam is great to combine with tramadol when you‚Äôre planning on taking a larger dose tramadol, though none really thinks about that combining any benzo with an opiate also enhances the risk of respiratory depression. I‚Äôm not saying that this is relevant in your case, but none really thinks about this. Also if you (or anyone really) in the future plan on getting of clonazepam, don‚Äôt touch tramadol for 1-1.5 month since quitting clonazepam alone could lead to severe seizures on its own and should NOT be combined with this shitty but amazing opiate tramadol lol

Tramadol is so fucking sneaky haha damn I‚Äôve fucked around with tramadol waay to much and I‚Äôm barely 18, I almost died from this shit way to many times lol first time I took tram was when I was 15, i took 2000mg tramadol with booze and concerta right after I had quit fent Xanax and coke, had a horrible horrible seizure and ended up at the ER, barely survived.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
774^Edelwiess666^opiates^Thanks so much for this, I'll look into all those resources and I have used suboxone in the past but never as prescribed, I do need to work on my underlying stuff and related issues its been hard and even harder without drugs, even though I do still use. It has been a strange experience, I do feel I wasn't fully ready because I wasn't done with opiates or ready to give it up and still in massive denial after my overdose and death of someone close to me same week from the same drug, despite being open to ibogaine and it helping me for a while and the progresses I did make in rehab, I just never was really ready to really give up all drugs, I do have hope though and I know I need to keep trying and at least do something, even if for now I still struggle I just want to find things that make me happy again outside of opiates and drugs, I used to love to learn and create and starting there again will benefit me a lot, ive got a long way to go but I need to start now and be deligent

774^Edelwiess666^opiates^Verrry distant future if I can budget to do ibogaine again, given I dont die first but I'm trying not to use opiates as heavily as I was overdose/ preibogaine time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
775^oneshotnicky^opiates^Ill probably get down votes for this but weed withdrawls are a joke when compared to benzos and opiates

775^oneshotnicky^black^That little amount if ativan wont kill you even if you went hard on the alcohol. Might black out tho

775^oneshotnicky^opiate^Most people cant find real oxy dude or if they can it's a super low dose of percocet. Plus that shit is expensive for alot of opiate addicts

775^oneshotnicky^opiate^Youre already addicted to dope why the fuck would you want to add crack into that equation. Fuck coke/crack anyways it ruins the opiate high ime

775^oneshotnicky^opiates^I take opiates near everyday and I love weed it's still my favorite drug. Every once and a while I'll get paranoid but I'll just tough through it. I get most of my opiates for free from family so most of my drug budget goes to weed and some benzos. Weed is such a part of my lifestyle that even if it made me paranoid all the time(which it doesnt) I'd still smoke it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
776^OHGreadmore^opiates^It's all good. I've been dabbling with all forms of opiates for the last couple of years. Haven't found one I've really enjoyed yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
777^xero40^opioid^LSD was the original 12 step as well!  I think it's the opposite of an opioid imo

777^xero40^opioid^Yeah I hit IV bupe and puked for 3 days and went to the ER and they hit me with zofran.  My body was shutting down from dehydration.  You can def die from opioid withdraw if it's bad enough to not let you hydrate.

777^xero40^opioid^Him being able to sleep is huge that's very lucky and a massive benfit.  Clonidine is amazing. Benzos can be but you have to be careful with that as it carries worse physical addiction.  For me warmth was the best.  Compressive clothing especially socks.  Chipped ice if he can't keep water down but he has zofran so he should be fine there.  Gabapentin or better yet pregabalin.  Pregabalin is essentially gabapentin that absorbs way better and can be dosed much lower.  Kratom helps a bit for some, it did for me and I had precip from fentanyl and bupe as well. It's was pretty brutal for a long time about a months and. A half but I extended it a bit by using fent to get one night of sleep a week.  At this point he can dose bupe again but in my experience once that precip hit it like friend my brain I went to the ER as well. I was arraid I did permanant damage(the doc at er and nurses were even unsure, whatever opioid it was I don't know but it even tasted very different from anything else I've tried) and was debating suicide bc it was unbearable.  The plus is hes over the worst now and if he's able to sleep somehow then just keep that up and let him sleep it off. I know I always have nightmares with crashed dopamine though.  Also I can't recommend this but in my personal experience LSD was a very unique help.  It's the only thing that picked my spirits up enough to continue. I took a full tab but the low dopamine blocked the trip effect(or something) and I was super happy and relaxed and it helped stomach (probably 5ht3a activity) and made.me.able to regroup while listening to music.  The variability in brains however I'd advise against this unless he's used to that headspace.  Also medical bud.  I got my script after going to my doctor for sleep meds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
778^OnlyEightAreMilhouse^opiates^See, I don‚Äôt think that is correct.  So, I‚Äôm gonna wait for other responses, thanks.  And...preach on Subutex or Suboxon..not Opiates

778^OnlyEightAreMilhouse^opiates^No, I believe you.  I have done the research.  I guess I just didn‚Äôt want to hear that seeing I am never using any other opiates üôÅ

778^OnlyEightAreMilhouse^opiate^There is no way that can.  Suboxone completely takes over or ‚Äòfills‚Äô the opiate receptors in your brain for a pretty decent amount of time.  Any opiate that you take will just bounce off of the receptors and be eliminated from your system.  It has nothing to do with tolerance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
779^MMABENNYJ^black^Yeah. It doesn't fuck my life up too much. I really only do BJJ n pads. I'm done with getting punched in the face. I get a MASSIVE high if I take my normal does before a roll. 
Sometimes it makes me get into a zone where I can't get tapped. Or it appears I can't. I'm sure if a black belt was there I'd be tapping more than Fred Astair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
780^leone666^black^I‚Äôm a huge punk fan. Have misfits & black flag tattood on me & I absolutely love Zeppelin, they are easily one of the best rock bands to ever make music.

780^leone666^opiate^Very true but I‚Äôve had this fantasy for awhile, even before I‚Äôve had tried an opiate. I guess it‚Äôs due to all the glorifying movies and music I enjoy. & I guess Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley etc being some of my biggest inspirations in music wouldn‚Äôt help haha.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
781^Whein341^opiates^Damn can I ask what‚Äôs up with your back? Maybe we have some pain issues in common? I‚Äôve been trying to relate to people on here because I can‚Äôt talk about it in normal life unless with my doctor

I‚Äôm glad you don‚Äôt take opiates to just get high.  Mostly because I don‚Äôt either and am trying to find like minded members! I‚Äôm very new to reddit and don‚Äôt even know how to fully use it but is there a way to follow you or become friends with you like on fb?

781^Whein341^opiates^Wow I wish opiates like those made me feel good. Consider yourself lucky and quit while your ahead. They are fun but once you start messing around with stronger ones (hopefully you don‚Äôt) you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs both God and the Devil whispering things in both ears

781^Whein341^opiates^I suffer from moderate compression fractures in my vertebrae, some are healed, one is not healing in my mid back. This has exposed me to opiates on a whole  other level, I‚Äôm no longer seeking any type of high other than the feeling of pain relief. I started when I was younger with abuse but now rely on them to treat my pain.

781^Whein341^opiate^I‚Äôve gotten the same thing almost like intense rage. Opiates put me in a space where I am reveling in the blissful solitude that is the nod. If some stimulus disrupts that zone they put me in I immediatly react with anger, does this sound similar? It‚Äôs like being repeatedly awakened out of extremely comfortable restful and sound sleep l, very similar feeling at least in my experience. Ask me any questions you want I‚Äôm no expert and many on here understand the  pharmacology of opiates/drugs in general far better than me. I do have plenty of first hand experience with nearly every prescription opiate in existence

781^Whein341^opiates^I‚Äôve taken it and noticed it is wonderful for depression.  Tramadol doesn‚Äôt act as an SSRI but instead works more on norepinephrine as is therefore called an SNRI. I think it‚Äôs effective for me personally and treats my depression well, unfortunately it‚Äôs my opinion that all other true opiates make my depression worse in the long run

781^Whein341^opiate^It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs just that opiates aren‚Äôt viewed by the FDA as a treatment for depression. It‚Äôs counterproductive to prescribe an opiate for depression as they naturally deplete you of happy chemicals in your brain. 

Drugs like ssri‚Äôs increase the reuptake of serotonin and therefore appear to be a better option long term.. I can‚Äôt deny the powerful anti depressive effects that drugs like hydrocodone, oxycodone and buprenorphine especially possess. They make you feel wonderful, and once those effects come on life doesn‚Äôt have the same negative outlook as it did. I believe that opiates cause depression if anything. They temporarily give you a high that makes the user feel extremely content and the ability to shut off and ignore things that were bothering me is a constant effect. 
Tramadol and suboxone aren‚Äôt true opiates but have a wide array of strange anti depressant properties. Even the slightest amount of suboxone gives me a different mindset and the depressive thoughts literally melt away from the all day type relief sub provides.

Me personally, I don‚Äôt think opiates will ever get the chance to treat depression, they are here for pain and people like myself who have chronic pain issues struggle to get them, can you imagine how difficult it would be for someone to have them prescribed for depression, a disease you can‚Äôt take an xray for and see the fracture. Also opiates are known for numbing thoughts/pain both emotional and physical, and don‚Äôt really allow the user to tackle any sort of internal issues going on. My point is they provide an escape instead of any real effects that treat the issue of chemical imbalance in the brain, the cause of clinical depression.
I would recommend a depressed individual NOT take an opiate as the doors for addiction, rash decision making, and ‚Äútaking too much of a good thing‚Äù swing wide open when you have a depressed person taking opiates

781^Whein341^opiates^How do you get this prescribed to you, can I ask what condition you have that warrants this? I only ask because I am in such a struggle getting opiates prescribed to me for compression fractures and am curious what it takes to  receive this level of opiateness

781^Whein341^opiate^I am also on 50000 IUs of vitaminD a week to increase my levels of it. No clue if vitamin d could have anything to do with my vertebrae fracturing so easily. I legitimately feel like I can‚Äôt function at least right now without an opiate and doctors can‚Äôt comprehend that it is completely normal to not want to sit around all day in pain

781^Whein341^opiates^What drove you away from PM 
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the state I‚Äôm livi in but it is literally impossible to get prescribed opiates beyond hydrocodne and like I said my pain meds aren‚Äôt even touching these fractures

781^Whein341^opiates^It‚Äôs literally impossible to be younger than 30 and not seen as a drug seeking pill head if you have a conversation about opiates treating your pain with a doctor, they don‚Äôt help you, they just want to accuse you of things and
Make the process as difficult as it can be. I currently get 60 5mg norco for moderate compression fractures in my
Vertebrae and it does fuck all. I hate this shit and wish I could just be put on a medicine that effectively treats my pain l. I have tried at least 40 different steroids, anti anxiety meds,  shitty weak opiates, NSAIDS, every muscle relaxer that‚Äôs on the market to my knowledge, pregabalin, gabapentin, 
    I have no where else to turn, I live everyday feeling hopeless and my family doesn‚Äôt know what to do for me. My kids see me in pain, I manage to hold down a caregiving job for mentally ill people, but my life is slipping before my eyes. I know your struggle and it‚Äôs very difficult to get them for any severe condition much less minor ones. Especially my state, I feel like it‚Äôs notoriously awful for obtaining opiates in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
782^ogtrillrayman^opiates^I don't want any more medication, I just want to be sober at least for a week for once in hte past 10 years its so hard, even without opiates it's like all my past demons are calling me. Like yesterday i was on kratomm two beans, and weed, today i literally haven't taken anything except red bul and i slept all dayt ill 5PM, im loosing my mind.

Should i take klonopin, but when I'm on benzos i take every drug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
783^CrazyKacy^opiates^I didn‚Äôt even know anything about opiates at the time I had never done drugs other than weed at that point. How was I supposed to know. When I showed him he said that he wouldn‚Äôt and I was ignorant. And he wasn‚Äôt a current addict he had stopped.

783^CrazyKacy^dreams^I have dreams with my alters. I am a lucid dreamer usually it starts off in one dream and skips to the next but if I am actively lucid dreaming I can just call their name a couple times and they will come out and we will have awesome dream adventures....coolest thing ever.

784^throwloveredditfent^opiate^Hey buddm when i was 16 i took my very first opiate ever!! My very first time was 30mg oxycodone thats dojble ur dose and i was very skinny i was nodding hard. Take them

Have u dome a lot of pills before?

784^throwloveredditfent^china^This shit is so strong that it takes 20 minites of me sleeping in the bathroom to take a piss if u know what i mean. 50mg of normal not china heroin it takes for me to nod this stuff 20mg about to nod

It last a super long time my pupils stay tiny. But i wouldnt know i do at least 10 lines a day but no euphoria if so u could be right.

U feel what im saying fam some h makes me feel soo good and sleepy. This pretty much only makes me sleepy. Euphoria isnt really there. Im addicted so its gonnna be there because its a hell a lot better then being sick.

I been using .1 a day of this. I just biught it 3 days ago. My friend said she will sell me a ful gram 170 because it the best ever.

Time goes by so much faster when ur not in wd. Part of me really wants to get sober. But man when time goes by that slow and everythung hurts.

784^throwloveredditfent^opiates^I did a lot of cocaine and crack well not a lot prob 10 grams -20 grams in my entire life (3 years). And i would never crave it. But when i would comedown i would have anxiety and would wanna keep doing more and more. But heroin and opiates is not like that. I had some people rob me the other day. And they got addicted to heroin they would use 3-7 days in a row and then they would day there body would hurt and feel so sick. From only using that short of a time


Bud i really wanted some cocaine. I gave my dealer a extra $15 when u bought h and he ignored me and didnt give me any. Last time i did cocaine was November and my dad biught me some

784^throwloveredditfent^opiate^Codeine pills make me itchy. When i did ky first opiate like i said it was 30mg oxcodone. I had so much euohoria i would wake up and rap as fast as i could around all my friends because i thought my raps wwere do dope. Then i would pass out wake up 5 minutes later rap fall back asleep this repeated fir hours.

After doing heroin and not doung heroin for 12 days last year i tried 50mg of oxy and nothing.


Hope this give u a idea. Im 19 and i wanna be off all this shit and never take it again. It is not worth being addicted. But thats my fault for using everyday fir years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
785^RawlingRR^opiate^Because you're new to the substance. Its sudden raise of mental dependance once you start something new because of how much it helps. It will slowely go away and even if you do get a real mental dependence after awhile, it will go away and you will learn to go without it. As long as you're perscribed you should be good because you alwase have it and DexAmp /Vyvanse/Adderall is the safest (idk abt safest, maybe most lenient?)  scheduled drug you could withdrawal from in my opinion. It seemed hard st first but after withdrawaling from oxycodone its a piece of cake now. You are just tired and really hungry and sometimes have minor depressive symptoms but thats nothing compared to a opiate or benzo withdrawal. Tolerance doesnt raise quick on amphetamines either, ive been on the same dose for 1.5 years and pretty much get the same affects except a bit less motivation.

785^RawlingRR^opiate^Tramadol is an opiate that can have stimulant like affects on norepinephrine and whatnot at high doses. My friend had a seizure from taking a lot,and went to the hospital. He survived and was healthy and fine the same night. Ive also heard about it being dangerous at high doses and that just confirmed it for me. But idk people get seizures for so many different reasons. The same night my friend had a seizure , he took 10,000 mg of gabapentin . which is an anti seizure med and is almost impossible to OD on, which honestly probably reduced how severe the seizure was and goes to show how strong the tramadol is

785^RawlingRR^opiates^Placebo most likely. I dont think its enough to affect you much at all, and the peptides might not even agonize MU kappa or any opioid receptor. Most likely your bodys way of saying you need gluten ? I would go to the doc. With opiates even in a lower dose of oxy (5-10 mg) you will get decently warm on the inside like cuddly and euphoric with a head buzz and relaxed yet motivated. Im not gonna diagnose you or anything but i would get everything set with a doctor and try not to think about it much and just do what feels right

785^RawlingRR^opioid^"Dextromethorphan (DXM) (d-3-methoxy-N-methyl- morphinan) is the dextro isomer of levomethorphan, a semisynthetic morphine derivative" - Deadiversion. Related but doesnt act on the Mu opioid receptor. 

Thank you! I appreciate the civil conversation

785^RawlingRR^opiate^They're related. I said its not an opiate but related to one. Snorting muscle relaxers like Cyclobenzaprine isnt great obviously but zanaflex is great (yes ik its not xanax lmao) it acts sorta like a benzo in a way and gives you full body relaxation even while w/d. 

Im perscribed adderall for ADHD, and take it everyday for awhile now. I appreciate the concern. 

Yes I know thats why I said do not take unless doctor says its ok (i think I did atleast). But I take Zoloft with adderall which has a higher reuptake inhibit affinity for serotonin than St Johns wort and im fine. Doesnt mean everyone will be, but the main concern is serotonin syndrome but its not a huge deal imo

785^RawlingRR^opioid^I would just go to the doc, ask for a blood test, tell them what happens after you eat gluten/bread but dont mention the opioid stuff. The blood test and other tests will most likely give the answer.

785^RawlingRR^opiate^Placebo happens most of the time without realising. By accident. Im not sayimg this is forsure pleacebo but just you going out of your way to ask about it makes you think more about it and you are saying that you are more sleepy etc etc. Nothing wrong with it,hell I wish i could do that. 

Carbs? The type of carb and carbs in general may give certain affects like that especially since they are rapidly absorbed and used for energy. 

I don't reccomend trying oxy or anything but if u do then you will see a huge difference (obviously). Ill do some research because this is very interesting and i appreciate you asking the question. Im just having a hard time even if studies show its true, believeing bread/gluten has opiate peptides strong enough to feel. 

One thing i think it could be if you have celiac disease / allergy that interferes or may interfere with gluten, is just the way its interacting with your gut. The reaction mixed with the use of carbs may cause a raise in body temperature (which opioids do the same! Thats the warm cuddly feeling but its specifically internal temp) and you get tired and fall asleep. You might wake up in cold sweats due to your intestines and body having a hard time processing the gluten.

785^RawlingRR^opiate^Taking atleast 2 days often or a week sometimes off will help with the magic. It will blunt though no matter what. And the reason you feel the "magic" is because thats the opiate magic. Starting opiates, for a good 4 months you'll have motivation and a sort of energy, but still having depressed CNS , etc. Its because of dopamine release. You still get dopamine release from adderall even if its lower than normal, that mixed with the high dopamine release from oxy or opiates in general, just bump the euphoria a notch higher. For me though im not wasteing 15 mg oxy on adderall. If i want full opiate affects ot full adderall effects i take them spread out / seperate. Stay safe brotha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
786^StickOfGlue112^opiates^Sounds like you overdosed the percs by just a bit. Normally when mixing cocaine and opiates the depressant effects of the opiates are counteracted by the stimulant effects of the cocaine. However uppers tend to wear off quicker than downers and as it does your body gradually slows down to a stop as it was only kept alive by the coke.

Sounds like you have a definite problem that almost cost you you're life mate. Might be time to step up the recovery game

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
787^Shaundogg83^opiate^No clinic is going to treat you with methadone for Kratom addiction. This is a terrible idea and would be dangerous as well. The smallest dose of methadone can be fatal to a non opiate tolerant person. While you may think you have a tolerance to opiates because of your Kratom use it's no where near enough to take methadone. Try tapering, using loperamide, DXM in small doses, CBD or weed, and OTC painkillers like Tylenol and Motrin. Loperamide is an opiate that binds to opiate receptors in the gut. It's very helpful for mild withdrawals. DXM in small doses can also help with mild withdrawals. You can beat this, it won't even be as bad as withdrawals from hydrocodone or tramadol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
788^vv0id^opiate^Methadone is a sinthetic opiate, that's very pure, not like heroin... It harms so much, as any other opiate, specially the liver (his most damaged organ). 

I didn't get to know him but I know that he was a great person. Married and with a son and a daughter who cried very much for him, as his brother. My friend loves all of his siblings, but he was his favourite brother. He told me that he was really strong and that he never saw him ill, not even a cold...

I felt so much this loss and I felt very guilty for being consuming heroin and for going to start to use methadone soon... 

He will be always remembered.

788^vv0id^chocolate^Nah it's not overdose what I'm worried about it's just getting too high so everybody realices it, forgetting my things at the train (I already forgot a bag being sober at the station, someone just told me), getting distracted so I don't realice it's my stop (I think mine is the last one) or losing the strength to take my luggage out the train (it's only taking it down and crossing the trains door honestly, and people  already helped me to put it up so.... )

Lol you're right it probably won't happen anything bad, and already an hour has passed and I'm not caring very much, I'll just start picking up my things some time before arriving as I did on the previous train. Thanks man, I'm going back to drink my chocolate milk !!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
789^idontlikeposting03^opiate^Get some gabapentin. Kratom is also an opiate and will help u but when u stop taking it u will still have withdrawals. The goal is to help the opiate withdrawals without taking opiates to help it. Gabapentin isnt an opiate so it will help u with the symptoms while ur brain heals in the area. Weed does help aswell but be cautious as It can make people paranoid and anxious. If you can get your hands on gabapentin and clonidine u should be alright. As far as the paws symptoms go like energy and sleep...exercise is the best thing for it. That and time...remember time heals all. Good luck. I'm 3 weeks off suboxone and I'm finally getting some energy. It's been a real drag these few weeks.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiate^So you tapered the best way possible. I jumped from 2 mg about 15 days ago and well...it was not as bad as I thought. But I definetly agree with the post above stating to get gabapentin. It is a miracle drug for opiate withdrawals. It made the whole process too easy for me personally. The lack of energy and diarrhea is still lingering for me but it's getting better. I am on 1200mg of gabapentin daily and just a f.y.i. u can get addicted to gabapentin and it has it's own bad withdrawals. But to me it's doing more good then bad right now and I do plan to taper off the gaba soon. Once my mind is fully healed from the opiate abuse. Dont be scared, subs are more mental then physical but u will feel some wds. If you need anything I'm here for u. GOOD LUCK! ITS THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiate^Why would u do that to yourself after being sober 9 months. I had back surgery so I know how back pain is. I still have 2 herniated discs and sciatica running down my right leg. It's bad but u getting on an opiate will just mask the pain cause ull b high and eventually ull have a habit and pain. Dont do it! I'm only 3 weeks clean but no amount of pain is going to make me go back to being a slave. I would goto a chiropractor if I was you. A good one can do you wonders. Good luck, I hope u do the next right thing.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiates^I hope you meant 0.1 mg and not a full mg of clonidine. It helps alot with the hot flashes and anxiety but it makes u rly lazy and tired. And when ur coming off opiates that's already a main issue to it does enhance that symptom.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiate^Yeah I've had horrible w.ds from kratom. People see it as harmless but it most certainly isnt that. The wds r just diff then ur traditional opiate.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiates^I owe me gettin off suboxone to gabapentin and my support system. Like someone said at doses 1200mg and higher it will help with the rls and mood issues. It will help u sleep and even help control ur body temperature. It should be given to everyone coming off opiates.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiates^KEEP IT UP!!! I am mad that I slipped up and did that 3g of kratom after being off suboxone ( which I think is one of the hardest opiates to kick) for 3 weeks but idt I set myself back too much. So happy for u though.

789^idontlikeposting03^opiates^I'm almost on 3 weeks of being off suboxone and all opiates. As I write this to you I am past the acute withdrawals, but have paws symptoms such as lethargy, fatigue,  some depression and a bit of a hard time sleeping. It's funny cause I finally get past the initial harsh sickness and started to get my appetite back and now I have a stomach virus. Didnt get even a simple cough for 7 years of shooting dope but 3 weeks off opiates and my body is being normal by getting sick once in a while. Go figure. I dont believe u have cancer, god forbid, but if u rly want to get it checked out.. by all means go for it. What u describes though seem like regular withdrawals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
790^CigarettesAfterSex7^opiate^Well. I mostly took low level painkillers. The strongest thing i ever took opiate wise was morphine. I've never took heroin or oxy, so I'm not sure if i should be here. Been told before that i didn't belong in these kinda places

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
791^yetanotherannon^opiates^I was a heavy meth user thru my 20s, and this is basically the route I took and it worked for that. My girl is 8 now so it's been nearly 8 years and I feel like I can look at that shit in the rear view for good, but fuck it's just so hard to imagine being in that place with opiates. Time just stands still. There's always been something. I sometimes feel an irrational contempt for "normal" people that are blissfully ignorant to the servitude that comes with it, but there's Ying in the Yang, you still love it. Like a Stockholm's bliss. Sorry I'm rambling, but thanks for taking the time to put Ur thoughts forward. Getting me thinking is better than using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
792^cruxtone^opioid^Thanks for your response. The vocal Suboxone users seem to generally agree that it's a nasty medication and, if effective, should be used for the minimum amount of time.

The reason I can't just quickly taper to a stop and attempt sobriety without an aide is because I've tried that multiple times. There is nothing that has kept me from relapsing eventually. I hope you find lasting sobriety but if I were in your shoes, I would eventually continue my addiction and the things involved with it (secrecy, money, morning withdrawals, other substances, etc).

Suboxone has given me stability inspite of its side effects. However, it has not eliminated cravings or treated my anxiety/depression like traditional opioids did. I'm hoping I can learn coping mechanisms for the cravings and treat my underlying anxiety/depression while the Suboxone keeps me stable.

If Suboxone is partially satiating my opioid receptors to keep me from continuing the patterns of substsnce abuse, then it seems it has its value. I want someone to say that they discovered they were able to partially heal and then established a better baseline for working toward full sobriety at the end of Suboxone treatment. To be at a better starting point then when going straight to sobriety without a Suboxone transition. 

I don't feel intense dullness or suicidal thoughts from the medication. I don't feel good either. I feel my old negative sober feelings but at like 50%. The 50% is giving me enough stamina to continue resisting the patterns of substance abuse. It still feels like work but I might be headed toward a better final outcome.

Are you equipped now to stay sober for the rest of your life? Please update the community with your progress and good luck! Again, thank you for your response.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
793^Throwaway_obvi_1^dreams^I do this.   Just let random images or mental ramblings that don't make sense flood my mind until they turn into dreams.  I have to remember to do this though and you have to consciously allow it to happen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
794^self-awarenarcissist^opiates^Its difficult to describe, it almost feels like something is stuck at times. 
 Other times it feels like I have a bruise. After going several times, I felt like i was going to have diarrhea and it reduced a lot of the pain. To my knowledge I never had bowel issues before getting off opiates. Not sure if this is relevant or not but I don't really feel that last part of my bowel almost like its numb. I went today and didn't realize i had already had some come out before pushing out what i thought was the beginning of it. I also have some trouble passing gas, like it feels a prompt pfft rather than an open fart. (Sorry for being gross, just trying to be as descriptive as possible)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
795^DankMyco^opiates^Are you interested in the comfort drugs that aren‚Äôt opiates? When I went to detox I got clonidine for the chills and sleep, roboxin for muscle aches, seroquel for sleep, vistiril for anxiety, mirapex for RLS, ibuprofen for pain and zofran for nausea. I know you can definitely get these from your doctor, they are all pretty inexpensive drugs. (At least they were thru my shit insurance) and if you aren‚Äôt comfortable with asking your doctor, you can start asking your friends or maybe find comparable drugs maybe you already have from previous prescriptions. But I really found that the ‚Äúcomfort meds‚Äù (none of which are opioid/opiates) really help with the symptoms you‚Äôre describing.

And these meds are only to be taken for seven days at most during the worst of withdrawals, so it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll be now ‚Äúon‚Äù something else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
796^CBDbeginner^opiates^Opiates do make you more sensitive to pain. Your body stops releasing endorphins because the pills are providing you with it. I was on oxycodone and Tramadol for years, and I got to the point of not even being able to tolerate cold temperatures unless I had taken a pill. You could also talk to your dr about low dose naltrexone for once you‚Äôre off the opiates. It helps get your body‚Äôs natural endorphins back, and I‚Äôve read that its anti-inflammatory benefits can help with IBS symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
797^Sneaky__C^gum^I was hiking in Mercer County today and someone had written ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù in spiky sweet gum balls on the trail. Oh, the irony of someone on a nature trail that obsessed with showing support to someone who wantonly destroys the environment. Likely suspect being one of the dozen hunters blasting pheasants out of the brush.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
798^Emma_Stoneddd^opiates^I really wanna say that they have to be on something like this, I'm from right around the same area and 1. The porn scene in FL is popping 2. Meth is EVERYWHERE here since they cracked down on all our pill mills and opiates . People down here really are a different breed smdh

798^Emma_Stoneddd^opiate^Alright so you have been arrested, but not in Hillsborough county. They still don't hold you at Twigg st. And I know the probation here is bullshit. My ex was a heroin addict and he knew when his scheduled drug tests were so they allowed him on his opiate script and he used in between tests. Hes dead now. If they would actually do their jobs he probably wouldn't be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
799^iscream80^opiates^I‚Äôm 100 pound female.  I used to drink about a bottle a night. I also have gone 10 months without opiates.  So now I gotta finally jump off drinking.   I weened myself down to just a glass or so of wine.  Which I was drinking out of a shot glass.  Yea yea I‚Äôm pathetic.  But to my doctor it still makes me an alcoholic.  TRUST ME when I say I don‚Äôt consider myself an alcoholic, really!
BUT when it came time to ‚Äújust stop drinking‚Äù, I couldn‚Äôt.  I haven‚Äôt been able to just stop. Which fucking sucks because I was feeling good about my 10 months clean of Oxys and now they‚Äôre telling me I gotta kick this too. 

And this part isn‚Äôt aimed at you but ‚Äî-
I get it - the downvotes. I don‚Äôt deserve any help or advice because I‚Äôm not drinking a bottle a day, still.


Edit: spelling

799^iscream80^opiates^Yea that makes sense. They keep telling me if you get off a drug like opiates you‚Äôll just end up drinking to replace it.  I‚Äôm still on the sub medicine so they want me to stop drinking before I‚Äôm 100% clean so I don‚Äôt turn to liquor.

799^iscream80^opiates^Yea I‚Äôm not sure how or why - but the wd never came up for drinking. Mostly it‚Äôs just in and out and about the suboxone and all.  Quitting drinking is something they just bring up more often and I agreed to do it.  But the conversation next turned to that. No idea why it never crossed my mind.  I guess because I‚Äôve been drinking so little.  And with opiates it was a huuuuge deal when I quit.  
But I will see my therapist in a week and my doc the week after.  I guess they aren‚Äôt concerned. I‚Äôm just panicking because I gotta rip the band aid off and really do it now.

799^iscream80^opiates^Congrats on getting this far!  Withdrawal of any kind sucks so bad.  And it‚Äôs hard to see the light some days.  I‚Äôm off opiates and it wasn‚Äôt fun. Still just trying to get through. 
60oz is more than I ever was drinking.  I‚Äôm not sure where the cutoff line is between mild or moderate or heavy drinker etc.  But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been going through it.  Good luck and thanks for the reply - I appreciate it.

799^iscream80^opiates^Damn I‚Äôm sorry.  And you don‚Äôt want to try and go off of it?
I‚Äôm holding out hope that I can quit all of it. But I‚Äôm scared that this is how I will feel forever. 
Fuck opiates and fuck the doctors handing them out like candy.  And fuck me for taking them.  
But I hear you.  Thanks for the reply.  Appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
800^TheDisobedience333^black^Kratom is illegal in my state. I have no experience with the black or grey market, so I wouldn‚Äôt be sure how to get some.

Plus I‚Äôve read that kratom will only prolong withdrawals. I‚Äôve also read the opposite though, so I have no idea what to believe. This is why I made this post; there is so much conflicting information out there!

800^TheDisobedience333^opiates^I am on day 4 of withdrawals. For some reason, I feel worse today than yesterday. I‚Äôve been in discomfort and pain for 4 days and I‚Äôm desperate for relief. 

My habit was around the equivalent of 40-50 mg of hydrocodone (though I took all kinds of different pills when I was actively using), then I got on suboxone for a month and managed to taper down to .5 mg. Suboxone was ruining my life (causing me depression, anhedonia, and suicidal thoughts), so I jumped off that onto extended release morphine. I rapidly tapered down to 15 mg of morphine, and my last dose was last Wednesday. 

I honestly thought withdrawals would be getting significantly better by now, based on my experience quitting in the past. I have work and appointments to go to starting tomorrow, and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it. The restlessness and the leg and back pain are terrible, but what really getting to me is the sweats. I‚Äôm either far too hot or shivering from cold - there is no in-between. I‚Äôve sweated through 3 pairs of sheets and 2 comforters in three days. Wearing clothing makes me too hot, but taking it off immediately sends goosebumps and shivers shooting through my entire body.

I know just one 30 mg codeine pill would make everything so much better at this point. But I‚Äôve come this far without taking anything... yet still, it‚Äôs calling to me. Screaming to me, at times. I can‚Äôt figure out whether making things better for me now will make it that much worse tomorrow. I only have 2 30 mg codeines left, plus a couple of 50 mg tramadols, so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to totally relapse on what I have, and I no longer have any access to any other opiates. I just want this to be over.

Edit: Apologies for the essay... withdrawals make me desperate to talk and talk and talk.

800^TheDisobedience333^opiates^Thank you for sharing your experience! So my issue is that I need to be functioning and back to work and such by Tuesday, but preferably Monday. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very important I don‚Äôt take anything to prolong the worst withdrawal symptoms. I have managed to quit opiates a couple times before, and my withdrawals only lasted about 3 days. 

I have actually had no problems with diarrhea or nausea this whole time, which makes me think my withdrawal must be much less intense than it could have been, and gives me hope that it will end soon. Perhaps tapering down with the suboxone is what did the trick? So instead of withdrawing from a 50 mg or so hydrodcodone habit, hopefully I‚Äôm withdrawing from the .5 mg suboxone instead. 

It‚Äôs really just the pain all over, the constant discomfort, and the restless legs that are getting to me and making me crave pills. But even if Imodium will help that now, I don‚Äôt want to take it if it‚Äôs going to prolong these symptoms to any extent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
801^Paran0idMan33^opiates^I hate to say it but you‚Äôre probably looking at closer to 6 months to ‚Äòreset‚Äô your tolerance, and even at that, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll ever go back to using it as prescribed. Maybe you can...but in my honest opinion it‚Äôs highly unlikely. I would look at ordering Kratom online or considering Suboxone. However Suboxone might not be enough for your pain. 

The best course is to try to get off opiates altogether. Taking 15-30/day, no matter your pain level, is addictive behavior. 

Talk to your doctor about exploring other options for pain management. Best wishes.

802^CaptainMorgner^opiates^From what I know opiates aren‚Äôt detected in saliva  after 72 hours (3days) after last use. 

I think you will be fine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
803^BalckDarcula^opiates^He said he wanted peak withdrawal before he took the sub and that the subs can be worse than other opiates so he wants to avoid them if possible.  He doesn't know i have more suboxone,  but if the worst is over and he might not need i think he'd rather not take itand id rather not give it. Im already worried about the clonazepam i gave him. Dude gets addicted to anything and everything so quick. Thanks for the reply!  He was using about .3mg of #4 heroin whatever that means. Don't know if that's stronger or weaker. He wasn't using needles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
804^kyevv^opiates^for RLS magic cure do a search on my posts. One of them is a thread called "quitting opiates the easy way: mucuna pruriens"

shouldnt use that stuff longterm tho cuz u might get parkinsons or dystonia symptoms.

807^Seakawn^dreams^"Reality checks" are merely statistical probabilities for becoming lucid in dreams, not guarantees.

You flip light switches in real life, making a habit of doing it all the time (even better if its exaggerated--i.e., every time you flip a light switch, you do it a few times in a row).

Therefore when you're dreaming, you're more likely to be in a situation where you flip a light switch. Heres where the statistical probability comes into play. **It won't work every time,** but it's not supposed to. The goal is to have it happen enough that **eventually** you flip a switch in your dream, and then the light ultimately acts funny (e.g. you turn it off but the light only goes dim instead of dark, or you turn it on and the light is only dim instead of bright).

And even then, you aren't guaranteed to become lucid. But you do it because there's a decent chance you will (e.g. hmm this light is weird... holy shit... I'm literally dreaming right now).

Lucid dreaming is a skill, and the more you practice techniques to initiate lucidity, the more you increase the potential that you'll become lucid.

And that's also why you want to practice as many reality checks as you can, to increase your chances from as many angles as possible. If you're dreaming and not in a scenario with light switches, obviously that reality check won't be applicable, and thus you'd have to hope for a chance for another reality check that *is* accessible (counting fingers, looking twice at a clock, etc.).

807^Seakawn^black^By this logic, literally near everything you do supports war, inequality, or general injustice.

So way to go--your philosophy actively frames all human beings as pieces of shit, just for the mere crime of living and participating in society/the economy just in general. You think you aren't supporting bad shit when you put gas in your car or buy food from your marketplace? Somewhere along the chain, you are. It's a grim reality that we all face.

Also the moral burden here isn't on people buying weed from the black market. It's on the government for illegalizing drugs and therefore creating a black market in the first place. If you don't buy the weed from your friend Joe, someone else will, so the wheel turns whether you engage with it or not. You're essentially advocating a boycott on the black market for a moral superiority, without realizing that boycotts are theoretically ineffective.

Ignoring issues is just as bad. What are you doing, personally, to stop the war on drugs? Check for blood on your own hands if you're not doing shit.

807^Seakawn^dreams^For me it was traumatic because of how anxious I was. If I didn't find my class on time, I dreaded the thought of catching up on missed work, walking in late and it being awkward, potentially going to the wrong class, etc.

And it became real because it actually happened to where I didn't find a class in time. So that just formed into a recurring anxiety that creeps back up in my dreams.

At least that's my best guess.

807^Seakawn^dreams^Yes, that's a less successful reality check, but it's definitely viable.

My friend kept a totam in his pocket for two weeks after seeing Inception, because he got interested in lucid dreams due to the movie and our following conversations about lucid dreaming.

He had a lucid dream after that time due to the totem. He dreamed that he had it in his pocket, and he messed with it and it didn't act physically normal, so he became momentarily lucid after recognizing the abnormality was because he was actually dreaming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
808^WesleySnape^black^Before going to China, I‚Äôve heard of the Chinese cock being small and I‚Äôm sure everyone has at some point. I wasn‚Äôt really on the habits of sword fights, so I could care less if they had a small chapstick for a dick. But as soon as I got there, something I wasn‚Äôt ready for happened. Something that really blew my mind at first, got me curious and then finally started getting me angry.


Chinese were curious to want to see what a black cock looks like in real life. Gay and straight, male and female, old and young. Everyone literally wanted to have a peak at it. That curiosity had no boundaries, no shame and not even a peak to be honest. 

Some of the things that have happened to me in China, regarding my cock are just too fucking weird to even post here. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have to post this in multiple communities before it gets a pass for posting or else it will just be a hidden story from all. 

Anyways, starts in my first week in China. I‚Äôve been to Beijing before but now I was there for an indefinite amount of time. I was staying with a friend but I‚Äôd have to find an apartment anytime soon. I‚Äôve heard that it could be tough to get an apartment there(this is another post by itself btw). 

On this particular day, my friend takes me to this bar around an area called Santorum, which is a shopping area mostly. Beijing night life for me is a bit dull. And other cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou have a more appeasing night life than Beijing‚Äôs. 

For some reason, Chinese like to drink their beer warm. I hate that and it gets your belly bloated. Other alcohol, you have to drink at your own risk, as most liquor is fake(bootlegged). Unless you drink Chinese wine, that‚Äôs a bit disgusting. You know counterfeit is a big problem when you start smoking Marlboro‚Äôs coming from North Korea(not shitting you). 

Another thing I hate about warm beer is that it makes you want to pee(at least for me it dies that). So after the second beer, I went to go pee. The yolo okey was where they had like 4-5 stalls and I chose to take the middle one as all of them were empty. Thats when the weirdest shit happens. I don‚Äôt know where they came from but all of a sudden all the stalls were occupied. I said normal, and didn‚Äôt give it much thought continues doing my thing. But then I kind of sensed someone behind me and then I turned around, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fucking dude, trying to look at my penis from behind me. Then I also notice , all four of them were actually trying to see what my cock looked like. 

I was shocked and I said, ‚ÄúWTF ARE YOU DOING?‚Äù I was actually pretty mad but who wouldn‚Äôt be. You have 5 guys staring at your cock and talking loudly in Chinese by now. I repeated, wtf are you doing?

One of the guys poorly spoke English and he said, ‚Äúwe want to see, black penis hahaha‚Äù and he said it like it was a normal request. As if like I was gonna feel sorry for his curiousity and drop my pants to be examined by 5 Chinese guys in a toilet at some random bar.  

I just said you guys are stupid but I don‚Äôt think they understood me as they were caught up in their conversation, which I‚Äôm sure was stilll about my cock. I didn‚Äôt even finish pissing but i has to leave cuz that made me uncomfortable.


I told my friend, who was also black everything that happened and started cracking up. He was like, ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve told you about that, it always happens‚Äù  And even told me that I‚Äôll have to get used to it if I wanted to survive in China. I knew it was gonna be a problem but him associating it with survival sounded absurd. 


Case 2‚Äì


I‚Äôm in Shenzhen. Beautiful city, great night life and I wished I had lived there to be honest. Shenzhen is the electronic of China FYI. 

I went to Shenzen from Guangzhou with a group of friends for a weekend of partying. Sunday morning, I wake up early and everyone is sleeping. We had a pretty long night and every one didn‚Äôt look like they were gonna wake up anytime soon. 

So i decided to buy something from shenzen, electronic city and all. I googled where the nearest mall around me was and I grabbed a taxi and go there. I I reached the place and I‚Äôm walking in and from behind I could two older ladies talking loud(shouting actually). Then they started shouting ‚Äúu, you‚Äù I turned around and they‚Äôre obviously calling me.

I stopped for them. They‚Äôre obviously in their 60s, short and very loud. Typical Chinese old woman as you‚Äôd expect. One of the older ladies holds my arms and without even acknowledging me, they‚Äôre still talking. I‚Äôm still trying to be nice,, 60 year olds. 

Then one of them takes out 200yuan and starts talking in chinese and I said NO CHINESE. Then she started pointing at my penis area and making a binocular sign. 

WTF! WTF!

Did I just get offered 200yuan to show my penis. I said what?? Now both are doing it, pointing towards my dick and binoculars. When they hailed at me, I expected rude, but not this. Not this at all. 


I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. But I said sorry, sorry and I left the two old women who were trying to lay me for a peak. WEIRD OLD BITCHES.



Case3‚Äì I rented an apartment and there was a shop underneath and one time I got condoms from there and surprise, surprise. They didn‚Äôt fit. Chinese condoms are small. Very small. You‚Äôd have a bloated dick after all the action. Sorry for the graphics but that shit is true. I told the shop owner  about this using my translator app and he laughed so hard that he made a phone all hole I was shopping there and he started laughing loudly on the phone. I had a feeling the conversation was about me. 

So the next time I go to the shop. The guy and his friends were there and they started laughing at me. Not in bullying way but it just made me uncomfortable as hell. So then dude takes out a package and says YOU, YOU. And he gives me DUREX XXL condoms. Idk where the hell he found XXL comdoms in China but I was really surprised. But as much as I‚Äôd like to write saying I used them all in a day, , XXL can fit my elbows, let alone my dick. I told him too big, then like he was saying really and starts trying to grab and feel my cock and laughing out loud with his friends backing him up.. I just left the shop pissed. 


Case 4- I am trying to hook up with a chinese girl. Girl started liking me but there‚Äôs something holding her back. I knew what it was, but I will say there was something holding her back. Then after a night out, she says ‚ÄúPromise me, that If we have sex, I‚Äôll not go to hospital‚Äù She said I know about black penis and I‚Äôm chinese, I could die. 

I‚Äôve never seen it as a cock of destruction but I promised her, nothing of that sort will happen. Not going to write the sex stuff but the aftermath,,sorryüôÑ


We started sort of like being serious and then I started noticing a trend with her. She‚Äôs love to come to the house, she‚Äôs love to go a bar that is dark but she wouldn‚Äôt want to be seen with me at day time. At first, it didn‚Äôt bother me but it gets to you. Like what the fuck. I didn‚Äôt do shit. 

So I asked and she said it was coincidence and nothing if that sort happened. Then she eventually started going out with me at daytime but I also started noticing people on the streets would point at us shamelessly and start talking in Chinese. I asked her and she said it‚Äôs not about us and that they‚Äôre talking about random things.


Whatever language it is,, you will know when somebody talks about you and I insisted for so many says that she tell me . It happened everytime so it was getting annoying too.

Then she tells me,, almost crying ‚Äú the reason I don‚Äôt like to be seen with you is because of people say about you and me,, she said that black guy has destroyed her pussy now, there‚Äôs no way she can be satisfied with a chinese penis now...her oust must be so wide, probably inserts a chinese mans head,, his dick probably reaches his knees.. blah blah,,I was like wtf,,my kneesüôÑü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÑ

809^jimmyayo^china^AFAIK people have only been buying breathing masks...who's overreacting? The market reacts the way it usually reacts to a destabilizing event, of which this is one. Many international companies have had to shut down their Chinese factories, inbound flight from China have been barred for many countries. They're all natural, expected precautions for the current situation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
810^drugzandfun^opiate^Ketameime. Lowers opiate tolerance, I noticed it after I nodded out off like one bag, after a week or two long ket binge, instead of three then did some research and turns out [BAM](https://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1948764) ketameime lowers opioid tolerance in patients who are resistant to the effect of painkillers

Edit: I'm mildly inebriated and completely skipped the 'not NMDA' part of the question. Sorry bout my useless comment but k is awesome still

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
811^OpioidSlumber^black^The hair is actually thinner there on most cats. You usually see it better on black cats because of the contrast between the hair and skin color.

813^An_absolute_unit^black^And do you still manage to live a somewhat functioning lifestyle? Ever been arrested? If it makes you feel any better there‚Äôs a black cat named Rupert on my street that‚Äôs adorable and your username made me think of him lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
814^AussieUpvotes^opiates^ThAts a large mood. Idk if I‚Äôd be addicted to opiates been using for 5 year. Without any actual addiction. But my tolerance would be wayyyy higher

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
815^Phreaky312^opiates^Hadnt done em in a month before that, haven't since.

I've found that opiates have a permanent tolerance to some degree, same way my friend who had gone even longer without them did 80mg the same night.

815^Phreaky312^opiate^2 weeks ago I did 110mg of oxy, 3mg Xanax and 4mg Klonopin in 8 hours.  I don't have an opiate tolerance but I used to do them alot.

How does that make you feel?

815^Phreaky312^gum^I ate a piece of fruit flavored gum on 2cb and acid and it was like a face orgasm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
816^Ef-Bee-Eye^opiates^Careful now... won't be too long till tolerance develops and you become an addict. That's how opiates trap you, that feeling of warm bliss all over is the best high ever.

816^Ef-Bee-Eye^opiate^Money over drugs. That way i can just live my life as a beach bum and just blaze really basic weed. Go exploring and all that shit. 

Drugs only go so far before they just turn into a problem that fucks your life up. I'm sure there's a ton of opiate users here that have spent a few hundred thousand dollars each on their addiction.

816^Ef-Bee-Eye^opiate^Recreationally for 2 years. Maybe 2 times a month, a perc or small mg oxy.

Then my dad got sick for 2 or 3 months outta nowhere. Went downhill from there and he died...

Upgraded to heroin soon after. Snorted for 2 years.

Quit a couple months back. No one knew of my addiction other than my 2 plugs and then when i was WDing and anonymously told reddit.

The people on here gave me hope and confidence and i am forever grateful. If it wasn't for r/drugs and the few opiate subs, i don't think i would have been able to get clean. That shit means soo much to me. I am a better person becuz of it.

Xanax kinda helped too lmao.

816^Ef-Bee-Eye^opiate^Take just enough for the pain. This sounds deceptively easy, almost to the point of being stupid, but it's easy to get trapped into a cycle of addiction.

You have to do a good job of balancing your priorities. If you can withstand the pain and loss of sleep, take less; if you place priority on pain relief, take more. 

The line gets real blurry and it's hard to know how your mind and body will react without the drugs after a certain period of time. My best advice is to not take them for fun and to feel high. Of course you'll feel something because it's a opiate but only you can really balance that out.

Stay safe and i hope you a quick recovery for that knee.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
817^sovietghosts^opioid^I would taper off Kratom first then Valium. The valium will help with withdrawals. I wouldn't recommend anyone using benzos to get over their opioid addiction, but since you're already using them you should keep it going.

&#x200B;

How much of each are you using?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
818^ShowMeYourTorts^black^That‚Äôs splitting hairs, and incorrect. Everyone except the stock bro who spoke had a script (eg nerdy computer guy, black producer, ex-nfl player, college girl, etc).

They delve into the recreational abuse of it, but that is far from the primary scope of the doc. It mostly focuses on whether it helps, if/how over-prescribed it is, and the history of the drug itself.

818^ShowMeYourTorts^black^A scare tactic? NFL guy was an addict, college girl was annoyed her friends wanted it, and stock bro‚Äôs buddy broke down. However, black dude loves it and so does coding guy. They both literally had no negative opinions on it the entire time. 

They had several doctors advocating it and some skeptical of its over-prescription n likelihood for abuse.

The only one who truly hated it was the weird artsy kid, yet he still acknowledged he needed it. 

They laid it all out there and showed many people, of varying ages and walks of life, with contrasting medical opinions, and they didn‚Äôt heavily favor one way or another as to its worthiness or benefits. 

I‚Äôve been prescribed ADHD for years (and had reluctant parents, which meant I got my script in law school - moreover, it was admittedly super easy to get despite my need for it). 

I thought it was a fair and accurate depiction of adderall/adhd both re how it affects the person in question, and the way it has influenced society. I used to get asked constantly for my addies in school (and still at work occasionally). 

But to each their own.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
819^lardtard123^opiate^If you don‚Äôt need it to get off a harder drug I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking it then. I just started taking it again for fun and if you aren‚Äôt careful it‚Äôs easy to get addicted because it‚Äôs an opiate even if r/kratom won‚Äôt say it.

819^lardtard123^opiates^Yeah just lost my best friend at 18 last week from a kpin overdose. I‚Äôm the one who found him too. Pretty shitty experience but honestly that‚Äôs where your bf will end up if he keeps doing opiates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
820^drbeavi5^opiate^I love a slight opiate buzz in public. It just makes me talkative, almost energetic in smallish doses. Just enough to really get the warm body feeling, not enough to nod off or slur speech ofc

820^drbeavi5^black^Be careful friend, I know many people that suffer severe issues from Xanax abuse - some of them ended their lives early cause it messed them up - and it's dangerous to stop taking them once you get a tolerance.

... Also you will completely forget everything (black out) if you drink on them too or atleast most people do. Become very belligerent v etc.

I'm not totally against xanax, if you take like 1 mg every other week or something, at a party etc. Should be okay. Do the drugs don't let them do you. Educate yourself

820^drbeavi5^opiates^Always end with a giant rock and wait as long as possible to smoke it. I prefer having something to come down with like xanax or opiates otherwise smoke it till I spent my life savings which is bad. 

I'd suggest laying off that shit too but this is a drugs sub so whatever

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
821^LevelVS^black^The media blamed VAPES like juul and other nicotine delivery devices when NO nicotine devices caused any of the illnesses. Despite that, the wave of illnesses from black market cannabis products resulted in a ban of vape flavors in some places when vaping had nothing to do with it. Yes, THC is vaporized when cartridges are used, but it's not called "vaping" and a battery with a THC cartridge is not called a "vape". Learn something?

821^LevelVS^china^The case with oxys is that they are pressed, they are ALWAYS fent. This is cause no underground manufacturer is going to synthesize legit oxycodone, way too expensive and much harder compared to just buying fent powder from china. So with M30s if it's not pharma then it's guaranteed fentanyl

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
822^xluzix^opiates^Me too I had gotten drunk before but I first enjoyed opiates before I had to like a beer lol

822^xluzix^opiate^That's tolerance bro, you got opiate tolerance so Tramadol won't do much as it is an opiate too

822^xluzix^opiate^Nah oxy is an opiate and klonopin is a benzo named clonazepam, very similar to Xanax alprazolam but these one other has a half life longer than Xanax and you don't get that super sleepy feeling after taking some, and the black outs aren't that bad. U said u r on Xanax u should know that tho

 but as I'm tryna put more effort to quit heroin cuz it sucks ass for me and any opiate at all. I used to like opiates too but I only can get it in here from black tar, and black tar sucks ass, poor quality drug which gets me feel no high anymore and just use it to properly function throughout the day. So I wanna quit that's why I'm taking these things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
823^chunx0r^black^But there is a black queer woman somewhere who probably has way less struggles than some white cis male? One thing I don't understand is do you see identity politics as a good in the world, or a necessary evil?

824^Muffinman392^china^Idk if it gets bad enough I wouldn't doubt China doing something like that. Not exactly uncharacteristic of them.

826^martinmartin538^black^As you mentioned, the things people tell other people to wear to get in techno clubs... 

You don‚Äôt have to be dressed in al black!!! Heck, the times I‚Äôve been to berghain I went fully white. I‚Äôve seen elderly women in there wearing very formal clothing, and even 2 guys that looked straight up like Nine Trey Bloods members.

Its not about wearing as much black as possible. Its about having a charismatic yet unconventional appearance. The bouncers are not checking if your pants are black. They look for people who go to these clubs because they genuinely enjoy the music and want to have a good time, not to get wasted or to see if the hype is truly worth it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
827^thehol^black^It‚Äôs not necessarily about fun. I mean, a lot of the people (especially teenagers) who take this shit are extremely depressed and looking for an easy escape. If you have not been deeply and truly depressed before, this quote from the book Infinite Jest describes it best: 

‚ÄúIt is a level of psychic pain wholly incompatible with human life as we know it. It is a sense of radical and thoroughgoing evil not just as a feature but as the essence of conscious existence. It is a sense of poisoning that pervades the self at the self‚Äôs most elementary levels. It is a nausea of the cells and soul. It is an unnumb intuition in which the world is fully rich and animate and un-map-like and also thoroughly painful and malignant and antagonistic to the self, which depressed self It billows on and coagulates around and wraps in Its black folds and absorbs into Itself, so that an almost mystical unity is achieved with a world every constituent of which means painful harm to the self. Its emotional character, the feeling Gompert describes It as, is probably mostly indescribable except as a sort of double bind in which any/all of the alternatives we associate with human agency‚Äîsitting or standing, doing or resting, speaking or keeping silent, living or dying‚Äîare not just unpleasant but literally horrible.‚Äù

When your only options are either feeling like that every waking hour, or taking a bunch of Benadryl and temporarily going crazy, but not having to deal with that shit... you pick the second option every time. There are tons of drugs that would do the job just as well or better, but DPH happens to be both ridiculously cheap and immediately available to anyone who wants some.

And, of course, some people just straight-up enjoy the high; either it gives them some euphoria or other non-delirious enjoyable qualities, or because they enjoy the feeling of being trapped in a custom made horror film for a while. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

827^thehol^gum^Reagent test. That‚Äôs your only option if you want to be completely safe. In lieu of that, you can try rubbing a minuscule amount on your gum. MDMA will not numb it, but cocaine will. That‚Äôs supposing, of course, that whatever‚Äôs in those baggies really is either of those two things.

827^thehol^opioid^Kratom‚Äôs active components (mostly mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) are opioid compounds, so no, it‚Äôs not a myth. It‚Äôs borderline impossible to OD on, and the withdrawals are supposed to be much less terrible than most other opioids. Definitely very useful stuff.

I‚Äôve tried it on a handful of occasions, having little other experience with opioids. It feels quite nice, I guess. Not exactly my thing but I can definitely see why it might be attractive to many.

827^thehol^black^People in a city near me are offering strangers hits of their ‚Äúweed‚Äù, then stealing their phones/wallets when they black out or start seizing. Disgusting shit.

827^thehol^opiates^Opiates are pretty effective antidepressants. So are stimulants. Both have been used historically for that purpose. If you want to get something somewhat similar, look into microdosing psychedelics!

830^HomiesTrismegistus^black^I saw a UFO with my friend one time and it scared us both very badly, we couldn't believe what we were seeing. We got lost in the woods when we were bow fishing on the river and followed all the tributaries for a few miles and forgetting which direction we came from or where we were.

We had the idea of "There is a train that comes through here. let's just wait until we hear it and go in that direction and follow it one way until it hits the road and we can find our car, if we go the wrong way we will know sooner or later and just walk opposite" we were entirely lost and that was literally our only option because it was becoming night time and both of our phones were dead and we didn't even have a lighter to smoke our pot or cigarettes(that part sucked).

Anyways so we had been following tributaries or streams forever thinking we would figure out where we were, but realistically just getting more lost. We heard the train when it was almost night time so we ran in that direction and found a road after seeing some headlights before we ever found tracks. We were exhausted and it was great because we could see all the way down because it was farmland, a house. The car had been going the opposite direction leaving the house, so too scared to go up to the house(we were in the middle of nowhere and had seen multiple no trespassing signs, so we were scared to let anyone see us) and ask where we were, we just followed the way the car we saw was driving.

On one side of us was the woods that we had just come out of, and on the other was a flat plain of farmland all the way to the horizon, there was literally nothing there. The sun was almost all the way down  but it wasn't quite dark yet, there were stars in the sky.

We saw, plain as daylight, this "invisible" triangular craft hovering about 50 feet off the ground, only about 300 feet or so away from us. And this thing was huge. We could make it out because there were three lights, they basically looked like stars, all connected by this black in color but almost like a mirror craft, we could see the color of the sky behind it and stars reflecting off of it. It was almost like it was invisible but we could make it out because of the three lights.

It made no noise and the "front" light would change in its intensity of brightness. It would stay the same size(these lights just looked like stars, they were pin pricks of light)but it would get SO bright like if we were looking into the sun and then it would dim back down to what the others looked like. It was so bizarre because it stayed the same size and was randomly changing in intensity to where just the pin prick of light would become so bright that we could barely even look at it.

We were scared shitless, I mean this thing was right in front of us and we still hang out to this day and talk about it. I will probably never see something as strange and novel as that again. Honestly with my personality I thought I would be curious and just walk up to this thing and investigate, but seriously, we were very scared of it and there was no way in hell we were walking up to that thing.

We kept walking and kept our eyes on it for a solid 15 minutes, it just stayed, silent. For a brief minute or so we took our concentration off of it and were talking to each other about it, then we look back and it's just gone. The thing was right next to us and then when we looked back it had literally vanished.

I'm a very skeptical person and even still if people tell me they "saw a UFO" I tend to not believe them or rationalize it to something else that is more realistic. But this really happened to us and neither of us will ever forget it. I looked up tons of things when we eventually found the main road leading to our car and drove home. It fit the description entirely of these "black triangle UFO" sightings. Before we started looking things up we did not even know that this was an actually referenced to type of UFO, it spooked us out even more reading some of the stories and how similar it was to what we saw. And we were reading that it probably was good we didn't walk up to it because apparently people who have have had cases of diseases caused by what they think was radiation(?). I don't know about all that but we definitely wouldn't have walked up to the thing, we had real fear going through us at the sight of that. It is such a surreal memory

830^HomiesTrismegistus^opiate^I wouldn't call myself insane.

If you took an opiate such as hydrocodone(in its pure form) once a week for 5 years and tylenol at 1000mg once a week for 5 years, the tylenol would most certainly be more physically destructive than the hydrocodone.

830^HomiesTrismegistus^opiate^I had a coworker die because he drank every night and took tylenol every morning. Everyone was explicitly told that the tylenol he was taking was the absolute main cause, not the alcohol and that tylenol is actually responsible for 90% of liver toxicity deaths.

I haven't taken a tylenol in ten years. It is literally just poison and the multiple gram dosage to even try to get rid of a headache(which barely even works) is very much not good for you.

Why it is the #1 doctor recommended pain reliever is beyond me. You're literally better off taking an opiate for your pain, as far as physical health goes. Of course they tend to pump those full of acetominophen as well. I do not know how much "more" healthy ibupofen or naproxen sodium is but in extreme cirumstances I will take naproxen sodium. I have basically convinced myself that it works better because of it working with the NMDA receptors. Also kratom, although the opioid effect for whatever reason won't get away headaches, however is a miracle for the pain I experience from breaking my pelvis in two places after a near fatal car accident. They were giving me 60mg oxycodone per day along with a lot of tylenol, which I then had no choice but for my body to become physically dependent on. Thank god for kratom, it is healthier than naproxen sodium in my mind. Even got all sorts of medical tests done a few years later and have had absolutely nothing go wrong with my body, the fact they are trying to ban it literally lives up with the "conspiracies" of big pharma wanting the population to be addicted to opiates. Kratom and marijuana stand in front of their profits. Interesting stuff.

831^Snail736^black^I was in a school shooting. I was at lunch, and heard a ‚Äúpow‚Äù! And I seen a girl that was about 20 feet to my left fall to the ground. (We had some lunch tables that are outside in the courtyard, and it was at the end of lunch so we were all standing around in the courtyard) I knew the girl that fell down, she was a really strange girl, that was pretty quiet all the time. When it happened a few people walked over and checked on her, but most people just kind of looked for a few seconds and shrugged it off. The gun that she was shot with was a .22 caliber rifle, so it wasn‚Äôt too awful loud. We had a habit of twisting water bottles up and popping off the lids at people, and that‚Äôs what I though happened. I thought someone shot a water bottle lid at her, and scared her. I started slowly walking over to her, and seen blood just pouring out of her neck. Once people realized what happened, everyone started running inside, and within 2 minutes, the school was put on a red alert. People were crying, and super freaked out. Teachers were crying, it was crazy. I ended up going to the principles office with about 50 other students during the code red, as we were told to go to the nearest room and get down on the ground. We were in there for about an hour before SWAT showed up, and escorted every student out of the school, and searched every student on their way out. I remember they all were wearing masks. I remember walking down the hallway and it being covered in lighters, dip cans, and cigarette packs, from people just throwing their stuff down so they wouldn‚Äôt get caught. We were escorted next door to the middle school, where our parents picked us up. I remember helicopters flying around over us as we walked to the middle school in a single file line with our hands on our heads. We found out the next day who the shooter was. He was a black guy, who was super calm, and friendly. I had a class with him, and played on his football team a few years back. Super nice guy. I found out the true story of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù it happened. There was a black girl in our lunch that got her 2 brothers to beat up the school shooter about a week before this all happened, and he brought a small 22 rifle to school and was going to shoot her. Not even sure how he managed to get a 22 rifle into the school but he did, I think it was a cricket 22. (Small single shot kids 22 rifle). Well he left class to use the bathroom, got the gun, and went up to the second story on the breezeway, and was trying to shoot the girl, who‚Äôs brothers beat him up, and accidentally shot an innocent person by accident, in the neck. It‚Äôs crazy because I was actually in the line of fire, as I was standing about 20 feet behind the girl who got shot. She ended up living, but if I recall was paralyzed from the waist down. Super sad situation. I think he got 25 years for it. Some people were really messed up from it happening; it didn‚Äôt really bother me to be honest. We had to go through metal detectors, and Had K9 dogs at school everyday for the rest of the year though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
832^DarkRollsPrepare2Fry^black^You‚Äôre right in almost any other case, but when it comes to the black vote over 30, it‚Äôs pretty much all Biden. Is it for a broad spectrum of reasons that a very specific demographic overwhelmingly supports a historically weak candidate? No chance. 
It‚Äôs because older and middle aged black voters are most familiar with the urgency of keeping racism out of government and to older voters of all races, Joe Biden is perceived as supremely electable. 
That of course will change as he proceeds to lose the first two contests.

832^DarkRollsPrepare2Fry^black^Being black has nothing to do with it. He described himself as a moderate conservative and that‚Äôs all you need to know to explain the character of his presidency.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
833^Mu-agonist^opioid^I mean yeah you could, probably wouldn‚Äôt do anything. When you take it orally it‚Äôs the byproducts of the drug that bind to the opioid receptors. Hydrocodone is also given via IV but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the same thing as boofing or sniffing it- will have no effect.

833^Mu-agonist^opioid^Red strains also have the highest amount of this chemical which is why they are good for opioid withdrawal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
834^Npapa01^opioid^No problem! 

The primary difference between drugs like etizolam, Xanax, and diazepam and drugs like Phenibut is that the former bind to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAa receptor and modulate GABA transport (to occur more frequently) while the latter inhibits calcium channels and actually has no direct influence on GABA (Phenibut being an exception as it binds to the GABAb receptor). 

I have no idea if kindling has anything to do with gabapentin wd sensitivity but given that the ‚Äòpentin‚Äôs have inhibitory effects similar to GABA it‚Äôs not too far fetched to think so. 

Kindling is usually discussed in the context of opioid drugs and GABAa/b agonists, modulators, but is likely involved in most systems. A good example to look at when trying to understand kindling is binge drinking. Binge drinking is actually more damaging than consistent alcoholism (to an extent) because when withdrawing from alcohol, your now uninhibited glutamate levels SKYROCKET. While glutamate is important for normalizing your receptors, it can also damage important neurological systems and worsen receptor uncoupling (loss of receptors). Repeating this process over and over again leads to more damage, unbalance, and uncoupling, making you far more sensitive to withdrawals and damage from alcohol.

834^Npapa01^opioid^Well kinda. So to start, alcohol is poorly understood from a pharmacological standpoint, but is believed to mediate its effects through GABA, 


‚Äú In any case, ethanol has long shown a similarity in its effects to positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and various general anesthetics.[19][52] Indeed, ethanol has been found to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated currents in functional assays.[19][52] In accordance, it is theorized and widely believed that the primary mechanism of action is as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator.‚Äù


With regard to opioid drugs, a study on kindling can be found here: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7200381/


^The TLDR is that opioid kindling exists but does not have much application to your original question.


Now, I can‚Äôt find any studies on the existence of gabapentinoid kindling (Phenibut, Gabapentin, etc.), however, from reading countless anecdotes on reddit, I‚Äôve found that people who abused and then cold-turkey‚Äôd Phenibut experience a very similar phenomenon. Besides the (sometimes) horrid ct withdrawals with similar symptoms to alcohol wd, they seem to experience significant post-acute withdrawal symptoms for months following abstinence, whereas people who tapered slowly do not often experience PAWS. Additionally, those who abused and wd‚Äôd from Phenibut report that, even years later, they‚Äôre unable to ‚Äúfeel the magic‚Äù that they once did after dosing Phenibut. 


The existence of PAWS and blunted effects upon relapse suggest long term or even permanent changes to brain chemistry following withdrawal, something we‚Äôve partially connected to the kindling phenomenon in benzodiazepines. Moreover, this phenomenon is predominantly found in users who did not taper and/or experienced severe withdrawals which indicates that a mechanism similar to the glutamate rebound found in Benzos may be occurring.


To answer your last question, it‚Äôs both. People like to explain tolerance and withdrawal through receptor ‚Äòdown-regulation‚Äô when, in reality, that‚Äôs likely not the case. The only evidence supporting that theory is from animal studies using incredibly high doses which fails to explain how nightly use of a normal dose of a short acting benzodiazepine produces dependence. 


So with alcohol, following an episode of heavy binge drinking, a 4-5 fold increase in glutamate release occurs. That much glutamate causes neuronal cell death, brain damage, and neuronal destruction. Specifically, the withdrawals change AMPA receptors (a type of glutamate receptors) in areas of the brain that control anxiety and seizure threshold, making that person more susceptible to anxiety and seizures. Repeating this process over and over again progressively makes the withdrawals worse (more anxiety & seizures). This is likely the primary mechanism behind neuronal kindling .

835^turner3210^china^Grav hires their own personal glassblowers in China. They CLAIM to pay them much better wages than those working for other factories. Grav also holds their glass to much higher standards and everything goes through at least a couple of quality checks before reaching the consumer. I cannot hate on Grav because they are very transparent about this, it‚Äôs posted on their website. All of their designs are patented in USA and China as well I believe. As much as I‚Äôd like to say ‚Äúgrav is just China go for dhgate‚Äù, Grav makes really nice pieces that captivate me in a weird way. Their quality is well above your average china glass.

835^turner3210^china^There are much better round bottoms on the DH which accommodate a regular bubble cap. I‚Äôd be very wary of buying a banger like this that only functions right with a specific type of carb cap. This is because china‚Äôs caps are always hit or miss on how well they seal, how much airflow they get, and the overall quality. There are normal 25mm flat top style bangers with round bottoms that people seem to really love. If you like the aesthetic go for it I guess

E: this elongated one with a skinny neck would be difficult to clean as well

835^turner3210^china^Although it‚Äôs amazing that China is finally making rigs with gill percs, it‚Äôs a damned shame he went straight for a salt glass clone. There‚Äôs so many other creative ways this perc could be used that would match chinaglass much better. This comes off as a broke ass salt clone :(

835^turner3210^black^This guy considers anything that isn‚Äôt hash rosin to be ‚Äúmid tier‚Äù wax. Which is an incorrect statement and demonstrates black and white thinking. There are many reasons someone may prefer one extract over another and claiming that the top tier is reserved for only one extract is down right ignorant. I personally prefer a good hash rosin myself but I‚Äôve also had hash rosin that was absolutely shit. All forms of wax exist on a scale of quality. Something important to remember is the skill of the extractor and quality in = quality out. If you‚Äôre paying top $ for wax from the top extractors in the country you can rest assured it will be of exceptional quality. Calling anything that isn‚Äôt hash rosin mids is a straight up insult to the countless hours of work put in by extractors to create signature products.

836^rlycoolgirl69420^dreams^Many awakenings taking place in these times. U been feeling like ur teleporting in ur dreams lately? Or waking up feeling like u just found out smt very important... Even my workmate said to me, religions out, spiritualitys in lol...

836^rlycoolgirl69420^dreams^I too had dreams about getting away from the hustle bustle that is my job and city, wanted to live in a van and just travel. I didn't do that. But now I feel completely whole, as if I could go anywhere and be happy now, I wake up everyday happy and ready for the day, even when I'm just going to my boring job ugh! Haha. But there was nothing that changed outside of me, it was a big switch that happened inside of me.

Op perhaps you won't find the happiness you seek by going off and living in your van, but perhaps you will, I took another version of what you could take and it worked out fine, perhaps yours could work out even better, but make sure you atleast have some money in the savings to keep you afloat! And make sure you can make some money along the way.

836^rlycoolgirl69420^dreams^It's been a hard 4 years, but I have finally been able to reach that point. Sometimes we get so spiritual we forget to care about people because we are so engulfed in becoming enlightened. After Christmas, I'm not sure what changed, but I began to feel so many human emotions I hadn't felt in a long time. I felt like helping my brothers n sisters (not literal just friends) and I wanted to be the one people know they can trust to ask for help and guidance. It's like a switch just went off and threw me back down to earth, my dreams have come back and much more. I'm very happy about this return, as I have developed the deep relationships I used to have when I was younger.

837^EmbracingHoffman^black^"Overdose" doesn't mean death. It just means you took too much. As someone who's eaten half a Black Bar before, that's too much, man.

837^EmbracingHoffman^black^I knew what they were referring to, but was more convinced that they had ignored the actual facts which are that, while her statements on tax breaks were slightly misleading, her general point about the negative impacts on the community were on-the-money as any reasonable news outlet would report (including the Vox article you linked.) The truth is rarely black or white; it generally requires a more nuanced explanation than "she is dumb" or "she is always right." I said it elsewhere, but AOC is young and passionate- it's okay to misspeak sometimes and take responsibility for it in your pursuit of justice and truth. We all misspeak sometimes, but few of us are recorded by dozens of reporters every time we do.

837^EmbracingHoffman^opiates^It doesn't fix any of those things. It disables your ability to be aware of anything. 

Opiates are the fucking devil. They ruin everything and fix nothing. They trick you into thinking they're the only road to happiness and then destroy every social connection you have, every ounce of self care, every bit of motivation and drive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
838^AtwellJ^opiates^Short answer:  Cherry Pie has the best fucking euphoric, relaxing effect I‚Äôve ever experienced. I can‚Äôt find the god damn seeds.

Long answer: I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic with nearly 6 years sober. I will save you years of liver damage, kidney damage, and money going to therapy: find out what is triggering you to crave opiates. Treating the plant as a replacement addiction only leads to more shit. Trust me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
839^dextromorphazepam^black^Maybe don't take 8mg next time. There's 2mg in a bar and that is enough to make you black out.

839^dextromorphazepam^black^Taking a bar to black out is one thing, but taking four like OP did is just ridiculous. He cannot blame Xanax, it was his/her idiotic idea to take four bars.

839^dextromorphazepam^opioid^The "holy trinity" is technically a benzo + an opioid + a muscle relaxer (typically Soma).

839^dextromorphazepam^opium^It's an opioid. It is not found in the opium poppy nor any other natural source. Opiates are morphine and codeine. Thebaine is also an opiate, while it doesn't act like opiate analgesics, it's still similar in structure and is found in the opium poppy. DXM is also an opioid because, while it acts different than an opioid analgesic, it is still similar in structure.

839^dextromorphazepam^opioid^Xanax doesn't even touch the euphoria Soma gives. Soma feels even more like alcohol than Xanax, it literally feels like you're drunk but with no nausea and with a STRONG body high. 1000mg Soma and some bud is the best I've ever felt from drugs, except maybe some acid trips. I can only imagine how the "holy trinity" feels (Soma, a benzo, and an opioid).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
840^RooseveltsRevenge^china^All of these people either have been to Wuhan or have close relationships who have. Still no clear person to person transmission outside of China.

EDIT: thus far most people seem to be realizing ‚Äúoh shit, I was in China and feeling sick, better go to the hospital‚Äù which is exactly what we want.

840^RooseveltsRevenge^china^This is a very serious situation in China, I don't think that's up for debate. The issue that the WHO is wrestling with is are the specific issues that allowed the quick transmission in China (The markets, population density, lack of early awareness of  novelty of the virus.) repeatable outside of China? As of now, it's unclear. If however, the virus begins to replicate outside of China, I'd confidently put money on WHO declaring a PHEIC.

&#x200B;

China ( A country nobody wants to give credit to on reddit.) has taking extremely proactive steps, steps I cannot imagine any western country taking.

840^RooseveltsRevenge^china^ 80 year old male, thus far the trend of it mainly killing older people is holding. (Not that this is a good thing, China has a very large senior population.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
841^clockfeet^black^Are you bothered that there are black people in Finland? Or just that the stereotype of them as drug dealers isn't unique to North America?

841^clockfeet^opiate^I think that may be partly because the pitfalls of opiate addiction are much more immediate than those of nicotine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
842^procoloria^china^We are already rolling with climate change. Climate change is here. The effects will intensify over the next few years. Expect to see more migrations. 

We must adapt as soon as possible. If we disequilibrate ecological systems by continuing unhindered emissions, these will spiral into maximum entropy. Complete breakdown of niches including our own. Competition for resources will triumph over coordinated coping strategies. Humanity extinct within a few millennia‚Äì very few might adapt quickly enough if we don‚Äôt start mass-mitigation now. 

On the other hand, if we begin mandating sustainability now, our future generations will inherit a fertile earth. It is too late to ensure their prosperity‚Äî their survival would be enough. This is dependent on reworking capital markets and weeding out production-oriented companies. A stronger, more responsible government run by younger people is a must. Democracy is secondary. China might emerge as the dominant model by 2050‚Äì USA sadly lacks a vision.

843^IVAISW^black^When does violence against oppression become justified? I doubt no one would argue that if African slaves in the 1800s had revolted and killed their slave masters that this would be wrong. I think most people would be accepting that the violence was justified. Skip forward a few decades to where black people are no longer slaves but have less rights than whites, can‚Äôt attend schools, have to give up seats on the bus, get beaten for touching white people etc. In this period of time black people are still horrifically oppressed but now people wouldn‚Äôt say a violent revolution is justified. MLK v Malcolm X; we view Malcolm X‚Äôs approach as wrong and that he shouldn‚Äôt have used violence to free his people he should have done it peacefully like MLK. That‚Äôs at least the view of the majority. 


So how oppressed must a person be before a violent revolution becomes justified? If a group of people are suffering due to the actions of another group should the oppressed group not end their oppressive rule by any means necessary? Or should they politely ask the oppressive group to stop oppressing them for as many decades as it takes?

843^IVAISW^black^Do you have issue with the revolution or is it just the violent part you disagree with?

844^newlightpsych^opium^Great points my friend, thank you for taking the time to write out this elaborate reply. I recently started learning programming again so I can't allow my mind to be cloudy, but funnily enough, the brain fog seems to be even worse during the initial WD period than when on a low dose of weed. 



You're right about us forgetting how it is like  to be sober. WD doesn't feel like sober, it feels like misery. I wish I could also have a puff of weed before sleep without all the negatives, but it's the same way for me like how you described, the next day I simply just keep wanting more, and even though I'll keep telling myself how stupid of a decision it is to get more again, I'll simply do it regardless, it feels like total lack of self-control, as if my mind was controlling my actions and not the other way around. 


Some things I've found to help are exercise(at least an hour of continous running for me), getting immersed in something non-drug related that interests you, avoiding pothead friends and above all, patience. It really is a struggle that gets downplayed by most people when they say "Oh, it's just a plant", yet so is the opium poppy or the deadly nightshade. 



Many potheads are ignorant, and the addiction indirectly feeds ignorance towards the subject as well, since people who love pot are guided by their emotions, not their pure rationality. Oh well. Here I am on my 3rd day of sobriety again, after my relapse, being sober for 18 days, the longest I've managed to get since years of daily use. Hoping to make it a month this time, please wish me luck.

So weird for black humor sub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
846^kodeineKrazy^black^I wasn't asking anybody to give a fuck though? And I'm not American so the racism in the USA holds no relevance to me.

But isn't it unfair for people to say that all whites are racist like somebody commented on here? 

Black people being enslaved was disgusting and people nowadays who know anything about human rights or at-least with half a brain will agree, my descendants were Trinidadian, one of the most affected of the Carribbean slave colonies.

I'm just saying that people can't keep saying that "the whites did it first" without any knowledge in the subject.
And he never mentioned here an now, just that whites are racist in general.
The poster never states that "the whites did it first, in America" 
He just makes a broad statement with no factual evidence.

846^kodeineKrazy^opiate^It's not as strong as other opes like methadone, heroin and fentanyl.

But I love codeine, it was the first opiate tried and the one I have always favoured.
I've done stronger opes and still get a great buzz from it.

846^kodeineKrazy^opiate^Oh I get ya dude. 
To be fair, I use DHC on occasion and use codeine twice a week now, just a couple months back I was a heavy opiate user.
I can survive the WDs from these as I used to codeine to come away from the stronger stuff.

I do however feel that your withdrawals can be subsided with regular doses of Ibuprofen and paracetamol alongside normal doses of loperamide to aid the bathroom issues.

I think that a-lot of addiction recovery isn't to stop the cravings for these drugs but more to learn to ignore an control them.

I know for most, it's easier to say than do but I have done it before and it is possible brother.

Try what I did and taper for a while before trying to go cold turkey.
For weeks, I took nothing more than 150mg codeine on a morning and the same at night and after a while, I even started to be able to get high on codeine again.
Now it's just twice a week and whatever dose I fancy because I know I won't do it again the day after.

I mean I might not do art full time, might work a little side job or something, but art is my dream and my passion, something I‚Äôve loved since I was a very little girl.

849^420andcars^black^Tbh i really like it turns out it was given to big donors for a renovation of independence hall in 1859 by a samuel h black in new york im a history buff so id like to keep it

849^420andcars^black^This was made by samuel h black in 1859. starting in 1857 independence hall had began renovations, in 1859 a fundraiser was held and this was given to the top donors. Samuel h black was born around 1829 on a plantation in Kentucky as a slave, in 1857 he escaped and came to new york. In 1859 he started a business specializing in electrotyping and guilding. In 1861 he left the business to fight for the union army and left control of his business to his son samuel black II and he ran the business until 1876. Samuel h black  lived until 1930 passing away at the age of 101 years old.

849^420andcars^black^I found a few examples of mine looks like the came in copper and white metal they were made by samuel h black in 1859 ( i misread the 3 ) for the highest donors to a renovation of independence hall samuel h black was a electrotyper and guilder active in new york  city from 1859-1861 turns out he lived from 1829-1930

850^Cocaine5mybreakfast^opiates^I don‚Äôt know the terminology but you‚Äôre absolutely incorrect if you think some people aren‚Äôt more prone to addiction then other people lmfao I know so many people addicted to smoking weed who would probably be dead in 6 months if they stumbled into opiates

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm invulnerable to addiction lmao I‚Äôm saying I generally don‚Äôt have any issues w putting stuff down / knowing my limits , when I was 16/17 I had basically unlimited access to pharma oxy‚Äôs and I just stopped once the tolerance got to a point where it was a waste of money

851^CS_zombie_plague^china^The chunks from speed paste are usually cuz its pressed for smuggling reasons. The speed I get is always clear white with powder and a decent amount of chunks. The drug in the image is slightly yellow, Ive had completely yellow amphetamine. It was disgusting. Wasnt washed in acetone at all! All I'm saying is, it isnt china white heroin for sure, it could be any drug including speed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
852^dope-priest^black^>racism isnt a big deal nowdays

Are you living in a bubble? I started by agreeing with almost everything you wrote, but your whole text has been disvalidated after this dumb shit you wrote, its obviously better than the past where black people were slaves, but we still live in a very racist world with slavery wounds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
853^i_dont_sell_weed^black^The boomers who were in my family were selfish cunts, they would have protested that charity work in Africa. The boomers used to be called the "me generation" by the generation before them. So I'd say yea, boomers were cunts and still are. Plus boomers talk mad trash on every other generation. I'm not saying your parents were cunts, because we cant generalize a group and I have met good people out of the boomer generation, most dislike there own gen. I would also argue that boomers were more evil in there time, atleast now days I can sit and have a meal with a black man without people giving looks or comments.

857^smoothslappyhours^opiates^Not on small doses. 100 mg is like a stimulant mixed with opiates. 

It‚Äôs called psychedelic heroin for a reason. Don‚Äôt dose more so you don‚Äôt end up tripping. 

Use dexcalc for weight and dosing and different plateaus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
858^-mjneat^opium^Ketamine fucked me up as well. I only used for 2 years but It was 2-3 grams each day. I once ordered 50gs from a website, forgot I ordered it(I was high) woke up to a package I had to sign for and went on a bender that last 2 days and I went through 18gs. Gave the rest to a friend and quit. I've used over 150 different drugs and ketamine(MXE to an extent as well) had me hook line and sinker. I've even had opium lying around I've managed to use a few times a month with no issues but ketamine just had me in it's grips unlike anything else I ever tried.

I'm around 8 1/2-9 years off now. The only way I got sober is when the whole country went dry around 9 years ago. My dealer only really sold to me by the end. Didnt help they lived in a flat beneath me. I still get a funky feeling bladder every now and again and I will never forget the bladder/gallbladder spasms that usedd to have me curled up in pain for 6 hours at a time.

858^-mjneat^opium^Heroin and opiates generally are not so amazing that you really want to take it again(minus IV maybe). I've done probably half an O of heroin over the years and only once had minor withdrawals. The thing with them though is there's no hangover or comedown. If you don't IV your quite likely to think 'whats all the fuss about'. The problem is the high grows on you and it totally relieves any amount of anxiety you have. I use opium at max once a week and have done for 8 years with only 2 bouts of minor withdrawal after 3-4 days of use in the first year. After going through that first opium tea withdrawal I knew not to get addicted to it again and it's been a sunday treat for me for years now. When I feel that psychological addiction starting to take hold I take a few months off and I have at least a week off every month that I do do it(so 3/4 sundays of the month I'll use). Also when I run out of poppies I take a few months off.

It's nt impossible to use opiates reasonably but I think it get's a lot harder when it comes to IVing. Also PPT is a bit of a pain to prepare unlike racking up a line or prepping IV. IIRC only 20% of recreational opiate users end up being problematic users. Funny thing is thoughh I've had plenty of addictions to other drugs but opiates scare me a little because of the physical aspect of the addiction. KEtamine for example absolutely hooked me hook line and sinker. I used to IM ketamine so I know how much more addictive the needle is compared to other ROAs.

Still wouldnt suggest recreational opiate use to anyone though but it's not quite like it's made out.

858^-mjneat^opiates^Most drugs have limited physical withdrawal effects outside of opiates and downers like alcohol/benzos. I've been taking opioid 2/3 times a month for around 6 years with only having a mild WD once but I smoked cannabis for 15 years daily. I can have opiates lying around because I know they are physically addictive and that is a trigger for me to take a break.

Because weed doesn't present many WD symptoms and doesn't impact you to the point of not being functioning it's almost a more insideous addiction because you believe everything is fine and it's not a problem. I'm pretty sure a lot of people who claim it has no negative effects have just not tried being sober for a while and don't want to quit. I do 100% get rebound REM nightmares and sweats when I quit though. Weed 100% has withdrawal effect they're just not that bad and honestly physical addition isn't nearly as bad as a psychological addition anyway so people saying it's only psychological and nothing to be worried about are kidding themselves.

It's fine to smoke weed but it's not a cure all, harmless drug like a lot of people like to believe and this is coming from someone who has always loved cannabis... It's not the devil drug that a lot of people believe either and has a lot of benefits but also has numerous drawbacks if it's overused.

858^-mjneat^dreams^Everything has its price even weed IME. I find it easy if I haven‚Äôt got it but abstaining if I do isn‚Äôt as easy. It stresses me out for a day or two and gives me bizzare dreams for a week or more. I Used and abused most types of drugs and cannabis seems to be the most forgiving but long term heavy use isn‚Äôt without some risks and there is a WD period to it it‚Äôs just minor in comparison to most other drugs. 

A lot of people think of cannabis as being a perfect drug with no negative effects, which isn‚Äôt the whole story either, and will dismiss the fact that a weed smoker can also be an addict and experience problems stopping.

858^-mjneat^opiate^Definitely less addictive than opiates. Opiates are just really easy to use all the time because you can pretty much function without impairment. They are kind of like the perfect drug for any time. I would say alcohol is much worse to come off though(from my experience with mild GHB and benzo addiction). Alcohol isn't exactly easy to get addicted to if your in a good place in your life. You have to be hammering it for years really and the hangover becomes a pain in the ass when you get older. Opiates though your tolerance can build pretty quickly especially if you have any history of use.

This is the closest thing I've heard in regards to the how and why of opiate addiction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9huWlXFA1s

858^-mjneat^black^I‚Äôm not really a fan of Shapiro but I don‚Äôt get the hate monger thing either. From what I can see he just has a different viewpoint to the left but he gives his reasoning and it doesn‚Äôt seem based in bias. I like Peterson as well and really struggle with most of reddit/twitters view of him as well. I can see how people can take short clips out of context but I don‚Äôt see most of the issues that he‚Äôs always critiques for. After watching his classes and lectures his view is a lot more nuanced than people are willing to believe. I think it‚Äôs the ‚Äòyou must agree with me or your a bad person‚Äô polarization that the internet seems to foster. There is no more grey just different shades of black and white...

858^-mjneat^opium^I got into weed because my friend gave me hash cake when I was 14. It went from smoking weed to pretty much everything else when I turned 18. Ketamine was my first real drug addiction though that stuff really got me hook line and sinker. Got over the ketamine and continued to use a plethora of different drugs an RCs. At some point during my K addiction I developed a benzo habit which ruined me slowly and took 18 months to fully get over after 10 months of abuse. Do not abuse benzos, it's so not worth it... Mostly sober these days(although I am drinking some opium at the moment). Turns out I was self medicating ADHD and since I have been prescribed Ritalin then my cravings have dropped through the floor and I can control my drug use which is a strange feeling...

I'm not really a Data Analyst even though I do spend a fair amount of time doing that these days. I work in the education sector in a small business delivering work based learning. We've grown over the 12 years I've been there so we're 10x the size so my role went from managing small networks to helping scale and redesign what and how we do things. I do some systems admin but that's mostly down to the MSP we have on hand. I tend to do things like powershell scripting to automate the creation of learners from one system to another. I support my boss on a lot of BI stuff because he knows what we need and enough of PBI to get the job done and I fill in when he's struggling with the DAX or SQL or just figuring out how best to do what he says we need. I also setup and maintain our SQL database that pulls datasets from different sources and standardizes the data into it's own structure so any changes or additional fields we need I need to write the SQL to automate from our hosted DB(shared in-between a few companies so it's off site) and to import locally after transferring VIA FTP(all automated). 

I do spend a fair bit of time maintaining training laptops or doing tech support if the MSP cannot fix the issues. We had one issue where OneDrive wasn't displaying anything in the online version and I had to troubleshoot(after MS support couldn't fix it) that required me brushing up on the client side object model to generate a new view since the functionality isn't in the GUI. Knowing that OneDrive is basically sharepoint I thought it was quite likely I could use the sharepoint libraries on the OD platform and it worked. In terms of sysadmin I probably do more with O365 than the onsite infrastructure because I setup and maintain the sharepoint sites and other o365 services. I'm hoping that I'll be doing more development work since we're at a point where I think that's what we need to do to grow further. I'm kind of a jack of all trades when it comes to IT which is pretty common to be honest when it comes to Small Businesses and IT. If your generally interested in IT then a small business is the place for you as long as your quick enough to learn whatever you need to in relatively short notice periods. It keeps you fresh but it can also wear you down. If you want to specialize in something then a bigger business is where you want to be because they are unlikely to have a few people doing everything.

If your interested in data science some things you can do is web scraping using beautiful soup for python. You can essentially turn any website into an API with web scraping which means anything on the WWW can be your dataset. I had done some python courses in data analysis on courser a few years that was a pretty good intro into the whole field. I have the book the course was based on here in front of me called 'Python for informatics - Exploring information' if your interested. PowerBI is a lot easier to churn out the dashboards though so you focus more on getting the right data instead of coding the whole thing out. I am hoping to look into the AI models that are common in python though once we finish V1 of the dashboards.

Good luck! If you ever need a chat drop me a PM

858^-mjneat^opiates^I was more talking about the 'everyone has nightmares therefor it's not the weed' comment. All I'm saying is there are negative effects from quitting recreational drugs and everyone is different. Also that because it's psychological and not physical doesn't necessarily mean that's any better. The most damaging addiction I had was to ketamine and that's not generally seen as an addictive drug to most people. The drug I abused most was probably weed because it seems so innocuous but the full range of it's effects were not really clear to me until I stopped using for a good while and went back(such as how it can heighten anxiety. Most drugs are not physically addictive in the way benzos or opiates are but most drugs will present some physical sings of withdrawal if they are used long enough.

858^-mjneat^opiates^Ahh that sucks but I can see it happening even if a lot will say it's all in your head. As I got older weed seemed to go from doesn't effect me whatsoever to I have to be pretty careful with it. It seems to cause me anxiety if I overuse these days whereas I used to be able to just smoke through it. I still can but I don't want to force myself into an anxious state for the sake of it.

I struggle with insomnia and depression so I know how those feels. Funnily enough since I cut down on my smoking and got off benzos it's so much better. I always thought weed was helping (and it kind of did) but turns out I was medicating unmedicated ADHD which was a cause of my sleep disorder and unhappy disposition. I'm of the belief that most heavy drug users self medicate to some extent so if your still in that lifestyle try and get it under control. Quitting benzos was the hardest thing I've done but it eventually made a lot of my anxiety related issues go down to basically non existent.

Weed really helps me sleep which is one of the reasons I wish I could have a bit lying around so I can smoke just before bed but it always, without fail, leads me to smoking more and more through the day. I went from a pipe a night to 3.5gs a day within a week last time I tried that. It's such a strange drug when it comes to addiction. I wouldn't call it addictive  in the sense opiates or cocaine are but because, for most people, the WD is minimal it makes it way too easy to abuse and if you keep it up over years then you essentially forget what being sober and having a clear mind is like.

I need to find a good hash dealer because I'm not really a massive fan of the super strength high thc weed everyone seems to love. I much prefer a good amount of CBD to level out the THC and I never get anxious from hash. Try hash if you can it helped me cut down massively. Went from smoking 3.5gs a day to using a pipe to cut out tobacco and eventually moved to hash and since I done that I no longer feel the need to always have(therefor always smoke) it lying around and I can take it or leave it these day.... mostly...

858^-mjneat^opiate^Ye but it only happens after I stop smoking. It's not a coincidence I've been smoking it for 15 years and only a few years started taking regular breaks. What your saying is like saying to an opiate addict that it's not withdrawal, everyone is sick and sweats at some point, not related at all or telling a benzo addict that it's all in their head and not physical just because the major symptoms are anxiety.

858^-mjneat^opiates^My mother had metal plates in her back and some sort of metal brace along with shaving parts of her spine off. 6 Months recovery time and to start off they gave her apap and ibuprofen. This is in the UK not the US. Had to tell my old man how ridiculous that is for an op like that. I get none for minor operations but she was in terrible pain for weeks even after she finally got some tramadol. 

It's like they only want to give them to terminal cancer patients and even then their pretty strict. I get opiates are addictive but they are the gold standard for pain relief for a reason. Even then you could solve the addiction in most cases with a quick sub taper after the pain eases off. Shes pushing 60 and never had any addiction issues in the past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
859^gmiwenht^china^You make an interesting point. But I don‚Äôt think the abolitionism shift was quite as sudden and as complete as you make it out to be. 

First of all, it didn‚Äôt happen overnight and as you know there was a civil war in the US, and it still continued in an institutional form right up until the civil rights movement, which was less than a century ago.

Second, we are nowhere close to eradicating slavery. Africa basically still has slavery. They might use different words for it, or they might not call it anything at all, but it still exists and it‚Äôs rampant. Cambodia still has actual and very literal child slavery. China has perhaps the most polished and politically sugar-coated form of slavery, but it‚Äôs still essentially slavery. Just because a person is not in chains doesn‚Äôt mean that their whole life isn‚Äôt owned and controlled by a government or a group of powerful individuals.

Which brings me to your original point. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going to be a paradigm shift or some kind of ‚Äúcatharsis of the grand consciousness of humanity‚Äù. I think we will slowly get to Oppenheimer‚Äôs vision as technology gets us to the point where we *eradicate scarcity*. The day that no man, woman or child anywhere in this world has to worry about food, water, electricity, education and internet is the day that we will begin to stop fighting wars.

At least the way I see it, everyone will eventually get to somewhere on the spectrum from apathetic to happy, and there will be nothing left to fight for. People will either pursue meaningful activities like reading, sports and the arts, or they will entertain themselves to death. Dictatorship will fall out of fashion because everyone will have whatever they want, and people will just calm down and plug into their VR sets and ignore all the bullshit. Armies will dissolve and governments will take on more of a passive role as human needs reach a kind of global equilibrium. But we‚Äôre talking about 500 years in my opinion. I don‚Äôt buy into the singularity hype so much.

859^gmiwenht^dreams^I just had a dream that I was writing my dreams down into a red journal called the Reb Book. I was almost finished but I ran out of ink. But I had already written down the dreams in my dream for that date. It was Tue 5th 7 12th or something. It didn‚Äôt make any sense. But I just remember the numbers Tue(2), 5, 7, 12. 

Then I woke up. I could remember the dream and I started writing it down in my actual dream journal. My actual dream journal is not red and it‚Äôs not called the Red Book, possibly because I‚Äôm not Carl Jung, but I‚Äôm not sure. So as soon I started writing down the dream, I couldn‚Äôt remember the dreams that I had written down within my dream.  All I remember was there was one static image and 3 dynamic dreams that each had a past and a future scene. So one and three pairs that is 1, 3, 3.

I could remember them all more or less and was juggling them in my ephemeral short term memory, but as soon as I went to write them down *they vanished*. You know how dreams just vanish from your memory as soon as you wake up, unless you catch them? Well I thought I caught them, but I only caught the dream, not the dreams within the dream. I‚Äôve been trying to relax and mediate and let them come back to me but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs happening.

Construction work started on the Huoshenshan hospital on 23 January and finished eight days later, a day short of breaking their own record time set in 2003. 

Timelapse video shows the scale and speed of construction, which appeared to continue through a number of nights. The new hospital has 1,000 beds and is expected to begin admitting patients from Monday

866^SeedEater-1o1^opiates^Dude it's not like that. I feel like getting back to that lifestyle, that I already am in but not idk. 

I just need something that can get me high and that doesn't destroy my life. Like weed. It's good but with my experience some strain is better than others. When I am high I don't want to go back and use opiates. I just enjoy life as it is, u know

866^SeedEater-1o1^opiates^Hell yeah I know that. That's why it's better to become dependent on weed than on oxys or percs or heroin or meth or benzo. I am trying to move my addiction from the opiates to weed. And maybe one day quit weed in the future, idk. I am past the withdrawals so I just need to stay clean, I have used other drugs just not opiates. And I want to limit my drug use to just weed. Cause I feel like weed is the safest drug, compared to all the other shit you can buy on the street

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
867^flatline904^opiate^The 2-methyl should be able to touch WD‚Äôs. When I was taking 15-20gpd of tianeptine sodium doses anywhere from 50-200mg of 2-methyl staved off WD‚Äôs for hours. Gabapentin would help your case a lot. I‚Äôve also had good experiences using DXM to alleviate opiate WD‚Äôs.

868^rememberwhatbarneysa^black^THRAK and Power to Believe rank among my very favorite Crimson albums. Only Red, Starless and Bible Black, and Discipline definitively defeat them for me.

869^Neanderthulean^black^I didn‚Äôt knock him out, didn‚Äôt even choke him out. I just Damian Maia-backpacked him until he sobered up enough to realize what a moron he was being. Also this was back in Highschool, I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre from but where I come from highschoolers were testosterone fueled morons who thought getting blackout drunk was ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

Like I said in the comment, I tried talking him down. But when people are blacked out on Gabaergics (ethanol, benzodiazepines, etc.) they aren‚Äôt themselves. They *literally* black out and every time  they eventually ‚Äúcome back‚Äù they always say stuff like ‚Äúwtf there‚Äôs no way I did that, I never do that shit‚Äù because they don‚Äôt. Drugs, when abused, can be absolutely destructive, especially ones which cause blackouts+reduced inhibitions.

Also I haven‚Äôt knocked anyone out in years, like I said Highschool wrestling teams are full of egotistical idiots who love fighting. Once I actually started training MMA and learned just how dangerous knockouts and brain damage can potentially be I haven‚Äôt done so since. 

I have no problems talking about how much of an idiot/cunt I was in the past, If you can‚Äôt look back at your past self objectively and say things like ‚Äúholy shit that guy was an absolute dumbass‚Äù you can easily stunt your own self-development. That‚Äôs how you end up getting the ‚ÄúWow! You really haven‚Äôt changed a bit!‚Äù at the high school reunion

If the reason you‚Äôre responding so negatively is because you think I‚Äôm coming off as a tough guy or something just know that that‚Äôs not my intent at all, I could see how someone could interpret it that way considering tone is impossible to interpret over the internet.

869^Neanderthulean^black^Intelligence and personality are physical? Disposition to mental illness is physical? Every study on the matter shows that people‚Äôs intelligence is primarily determined by genetic factors, not environmental. Also those of different genetics have varying degrees of predisposition to mental disorders. And physical differences are very important, Black people are at a much higher of cardiovascular disease than white people. Those of mixed races have a hard time getting bone marrow transplants (iirc it was bone marrow) because of their differences to those of a non-mixed race.

Health wise, physical differences are almost the only thing that matter.

869^Neanderthulean^opiates^It‚Äôs one of my favorite topics to learn about. It‚Äôs insane how even small differences in our genes can cause such huge differences between our organs and neurochemistry. Little things such as liver enzyme composition can be the difference between essential oils smelling nice to humans Vs. essential oils causing liver failure in cats  (of course this is between 2 different species but same principle, but seriously never let your cats anywhere near essential oils)

 My response to a lot of substances is different from almost everyone I know.
For example I can‚Äôt stand weed, MDMA, Alcohol, or opiates. LSD is alright if I‚Äôm alone and don‚Äôt have anything to do for the next 2 days but otherwise I do not like it. All the while my friends are absolutely in love with LSD and MDMA. 

Tryptamines and amphetamines are by far my favorites. Salvia was great too even with how intense it was. Coke and the phenidates are by far my least favorite highs. Not a huge fan of meth either (thank god) but Adderall is tied for my #1 favorite along with Psilocin. 

Ketamine is probably my second favorite, used to love DXM (first ever high that wasn‚Äôt weed) but after trying ketamine it feels straight up dirty.

870^Gucci__Flip__Flops^dreams^I hope so, thanks dude. Just a recurring thought, I have dreams and plans but if that doesn't work I know what I'm doing lol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
871^WillfulMurder^opioid^This is actually slightly true. Kratom contains opioid agonists AND antagonists. This is why redosing kratom doesn't work well until it wears off. Because of this, if you take kratom before other opioids, it will "dampen" the effects.  


But they don't cancel each other out. If you take your other opioids first, your receptors will sort of get saturated, then you can take the kratom about an hour later and you'll be good to go.

871^WillfulMurder^opiates^Opiates cause histamine release which often can lead to nausea among other things. Nicotine can also cause nausea, so I'd guess your body just isn't a fan of the two in conjunction.

871^WillfulMurder^opiate^Gabapentin is nice. I used it to ease benzo w/d process earlier this month. It kind of feels like a stimulating opiate.

Take 300mg every 30-45min with a tablespoon of peanut butter and drink some soda.

1800mg was a nice spot IMO. Didn't feel much cross tolerance from benzos but I was only using them for a year.

872^snaresht^dreams^There are several places that are reoccurring. One dream I‚Äôve had since I was very young, was thing haunted house that you would walk through that still pops up today. And then recently I‚Äôve been going into this creepy suburban area in my dreams

873^ChiTownChick^opioid^What is wrong with being an atheist/agnostic?
I disagree that faith can fix the opioid crisis. 
I‚Äôm not trying to start anything that‚Äôs just my two cents.

873^ChiTownChick^black^SPOILERS 


I agree with this poster. He writes whatever He wants to. Op are you saying you didn‚Äôt enjoy San Junipero? Imo that was one of the best episodes of Black Mirror. Also as this poster is saying there are only so many bad endings you can write. 
I have always loved this show for being as dark as it is. Having an occasional good ending mixes things up. San Junipero was incredible. I also loved Hang the Dj. 

It‚Äôs more about twists imo. Yes most episodes are dark and bleak, but even the lighter episodes have awesome twists. 

It did become more Americanized, and I was concerned that it would affect the show in a bad way but imo I don‚Äôt think it was. Yes early episodes like White Bear and White Christmas were amazing because of their dark twisted endings.

873^ChiTownChick^gum^You‚Äôre so strong to be able to quit! Unfortunately patches have never helped me personally, but gum did. I think if I did gum and really stuck to a regiment, I could be smoke free by my birthday (September). 

Anyway back to the case. I agree with you that the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù between Lisa and Michelle was more in Michelle‚Äôs head. It did feel like Michelle fantasizing in real time. You‚Äôre right that Michelle lied about a lot of things. I also believe people who say they were raped, but Michelle was changing her stories about that all the time. She was a known liar. I‚Äôm a survivor and sometimes you convince yourself that X happened so you don‚Äôt feel as bad and then after therapy you realize Y happened. I‚Äôm not saying she was raped, and I always believe the survivor. I‚Äôm saying you have a really good point about her changing her story and then saying it didn‚Äôt happen at all. 
As far as Lisa goes I think she did have feelings for her but they were one sided. I think you‚Äôre right about why Lisa‚Äôs mother cut off their friendship. It seems like Michelle could be a pathological liar to get attention, such as saying Conrad raped her and then saying they got to third base. I know we‚Äôve discussed this a lot but despite her lying issues I do think that her confession was true. We don‚Äôt have to discuss it. You have your opinion and I have mine and honestly we will never know who‚Äôs right. 

Conrad did have a history of multiple suicide attempts. I think if Michelle has called his mom things would be much different today. I don‚Äôt know why he wasn‚Äôt institutionalized. He should have been put in a residential program like I was. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs his family‚Äôs fault at all but they should‚Äôve looked into residentials. My family was able to get the state to pay because it was too expensive. But they didn‚Äôt do it alone. The therapeutic day school I went to helped them contact the right people. I was like Conrad as a teenager. My last suicide attempt was using my mom‚Äôs back pills ( OxyContin and norco plus Valium and dilation). I was already in residential but it was abusive. After that attempt I was put in a room that was empty for 6 months ( I wasn‚Äôt allowed clothes or anything else. I‚Äôd understand maybe a month. But 6?! There‚Äôs so much I could say but this isn‚Äôt about me). It wasn‚Äôt because they were worried, it was because the therapist took it personally. Thankfully Jewish children‚Äôs services investigated and saw proof of emotional abuse such as 3 hour ‚Äúsessions‚Äù , monitored phone calls, and when I couldn‚Äôt tell my parents how bad it was I wrote letters which were intercepted. It gave me ptsd and I had physically painful nightmares for years. Sorry to go off. I do think Conrad would‚Äôve benefited from a good residential treatment facility. I think his mom was so surprised because he was doing ‚Äúwell‚Äù outwardly. 

I absolutely agree about the Glee connection. It sounds crazy that there was one but when you look at things Michelle said after Cory Montieth died it is very clear there was a connection. I think she follow his death and Lea Michelle‚Äôs words obsessively. I remember when Chris Benoit died and what he did. My brother was a big WWE fan and he was really upset after it happened. I wasn‚Äôt into wrestling but I was upset after it happened. It was total tragedy. 

I definitely agree with you. She wanted to be Lea Michelle. She wanted to be the woman who had the dead boyfriend but was strong through out it all. Maybe she did want to be a singer/actress or maybe she just wanted the attention. I agree with you. She became more insistent the closer it came to the anniversary of Cory‚Äôs death. She did also mention contemplating Conrad‚Äôs death after Cory died.
I really enjoy talk to you about what happened between Michelle and  Conrad, and how Michelle factored into his death.

873^ChiTownChick^gum^Oh I can definitely relate to that. I‚Äôve known people in my life who had schadenfreude when I was struggling. It‚Äôs messed up. Trying to get you to start smoking again are the fucking worst. It‚Äôs hard enough to quit! I‚Äôve tried many times and it is so hard. You‚Äôre stronger than me to be able to quit :). Just a side question- how did you quit? The gum helps but it‚Äôs more about me being able to toughen up when it gets hard. 

I agree with you about Michelle being bisexual. I figured even if something did happen with that girl her mother and her would NEVER admit it. I don‚Äôt think it was only because that girl may have been bisexual and her mother( who maybe didn‚Äôt know) and they wanted it to be a secret it to look like Michelle was a crazy sociopath who would say anything for attention. I agree she had issues with being dramatic and wanting attention, but I do believe she had genuine feelings for that girl. I think her name was Lisa. 

I didn‚Äôt know his death was on the anniversary of Cory montieth‚Äôs death. I think that could explain her extreme insistence that he do it as soon as possible. I also know that people who‚Äôve made up their mind about ending their life usually will do so. However her insistence seemed to make him less sure and actually going through with it. I know we will probably disagree on this one point, but I think he could‚Äôve been helped. I do think Cory Montieth‚Äôs death definitely had a huge impact on her. Remember when she started saying weird things and he was like why‚Äôre you saying this stuff and she just appeared to be obsessed with Cory Montieth‚Äôs death and Lea Michelle. ( that‚Äôs her name right?) If she hadn‚Äôt been the little devil whispering and sometimes yelling in his ear I think he could‚Äôve made it. They should‚Äôve been kept apart. If she‚Äôd just texted his mother with whom she kept in contact with then there is a possibility he‚Äôd be alive. I‚Äôm saying this with experience with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Sometimes I‚Äôd get extremely suicidal but I was like Conrad and did research. When I found out that I‚Äôd have to take my mom‚Äôs OxyContin, norco, Valium, and Dilantin to really do it I was ready to die. Then when I woke up I tried to tell my mom I‚Äôd taken pills. She thought I just got high and I was taken back to the emotionally abusive residential that Jewish children‚Äôs services eventually came to the conclusion that there was abuse and I was removed. ( long story) but my point being I was thought I was resigned to die but I wasn‚Äôt. 

I think if Conrad was medicated and in a partial hospitalization program or full residential then I truly think without the Michelle factor he‚Äôd still be alive. That‚Äôs just my opinion. He had tried to commit suicide but no one is beyond help imo.

873^ChiTownChick^black^I had a couple extremely close friends when I was dealing with my anorexia and anxiety. I think she had issues with being overdramatic as well and wanted attention. It was very obvious I had an ed too. at 14 I got down to 87lbs at 5‚Äô5. Although the girl I thought was my bff ditched me afterwards. My mom was going to take us to six flags for my birthday and then she was supposed to spend the night. She called me and said she couldn‚Äôt go. She said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt your medicine make you tired?‚Äù And I was like ‚Äúwhat are you talking about??‚Äù  I think she was trying to trick me into admitting I was on psych meds but I wasn‚Äôt. She also started saying bad things about me and openly flirting with my long term first serious love. ( we were together for 2 years). But I realized she was just jealous and started getting really close to another couple girls and then there was my real BFF ( he was a guy and we‚Äôd been really close for years. We‚Äôd talk on the phone for hours and had so many inside jokes. He was my bf‚Äôs best friend first and then we became really close).  Sorry to go off on a tangent. My point was it wasn‚Äôt really her ed and other problems as much as she was an attention seeker and had a flair for the dramatic which would make people dislike her. 

The relationship with the girl was mentioned in the hbo documentary. Her relationship with Conrad became unhealthy almost right away. She asked if they were going to get married and he asked her what was wrong. She got very upset and said why?? WHY???? She got the attention she needed from him most of the time but was still a dramatic girl. 
Yes she was intense and did lie for attention but I truly believe that she confessed to that girl months later because she felt guilty. I don‚Äôt think any of that text was a lie. It is depressing. She was the weird dramatic girl who told lies for attention and it ultimately got a guy to commit suicide. 

I am considering her past lies and behavior when I say I think she did tell him to get in the truck and was even freaking out about getting caught. I think she was spinning out because she finally realized that she was a part of her boyfriend‚Äôs death. Telling that girl that she told him to get back in and also saying she felt guilty but at the same time was afraid of getting in trouble. It‚Äôs complicated but I don‚Äôt think that was a lie. If she‚Äôd texted it right after he died then yeah I‚Äôd say lie but it was months after and she realized she was fucked. 

When I say she grew a conscious I don‚Äôt mean she became a completely different person. I think she felt guilty and as far as her lack of apology or taking any responsibility well I don‚Äôt think she was there. She may never be there. Part of her feels guilty but the most important person in her life is her and I don‚Äôt think she still fully gets it. I don‚Äôt think she lied but I also don‚Äôt think she fully comprehends what she‚Äôs done. She can be of two minds about it. She can feel guilty but she can also feel like she didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. 

When I said she had a lot of supporters I should‚Äôve said that there are people who think she got the raw end of the deal because she has issues. I think because of how RedHanded  was defending her so much that there are people out there who feel she shouldn‚Äôt have been charged or that she should‚Äôve gotten more sympathy from the press. As far as the press goes I think her portrayal as a black widow to a defenseless teenager is wrong. She was very isolated and no publications really delved into her issues or anything. At least RedHanded took a side that was totally different than others. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but from what you‚Äôve told me about the podcast defending her actions so much I feel like there are people who think the bullying wasn‚Äôt that bad or don‚Äôt believe she ultimately pushed him over the edge. That‚Äôs why I loved the hbo thing. It shows both sides of the argument. During parts of it I did feel for her. But I still think she should‚Äôve gotten more time. The fact that she never took any responsibility shows that she still doesn‚Äôt believe what she did was all that bad. In her mind he was going to do it anyway. Except when he showed any hesitation she mocked him and got mad at him. It is in the document I linked. You should at least read the texts. I understand what you meant now about RedHanded. Of course it‚Äôs not as objective as a documentary. I just don‚Äôt know why they picked her side. They read the evidence. I understand though that the point of having a podcast is to share your opinion. They have a right to their opinion just like we have a right to ours. Even though we differ on certain things I still feel like we mostly agree. I didn‚Äôt know it was 11 months. It‚Äôs not nitpicking to correct me lol.

873^ChiTownChick^opiates^Thank you for saying that. It really does mean a lot xx. I just hate that I still have that itch ( you know the one) and I need to scratch it sometimes. I can‚Äôt just be on my regular doses sometimes because I miss being opioids and since I don‚Äôt want to really mess up I just stick to occasionally taking extra of medication I‚Äôm on which isn‚Äôt any better than buying it on the street imo. I had the chance recently to get some oxy which I used to abuse a lot in my teens when it was still crushable lol and I knew if I did it once ( I mean I‚Äôd have to stop taking the zubsolv first for a week which would be hell in and of itself since I‚Äôve experienced Suboxone withdrawal and it‚Äôs horrible) I‚Äôd keep wanting more and probably go back to h which would ruin my marriage and probably land me jail or in the ground so I didn‚Äôt do it. At least I have that. At least I know if I ever went back to opiates I‚Äôd be fucked. I‚Äôm trying to  do what you‚Äôre doing and take what I‚Äôm prescribed. It‚Äôs just really hard. My life is going great right now and I still want to get high which makes me feel guilty but I know addiction is a disease and I have to take every victory no matter how small as a huge deal. Sorry for the long response lol.

873^ChiTownChick^opiate^Well most drugs, even ones people don‚Äôt abuse like seroqual or SSRIs, cause withdrawal if you suddenly stop taking them. Gabapentin doesn‚Äôt cause withdrawal like benzos or other gaba drugs. It is more of a nuisance than torture like opiate withdrawal or benzo withdrawal. Trust me I used to abuse it and run early every month. Then I‚Äôd get insomnia, restlessness, and some anxiety but it‚Äôs nothing compared to benzo withdrawal which I have been through as well which causes seizures and psychosis just to name two symptoms. You‚Äôre overthinking it. Just take it as prescribed and you‚Äôll be fine. Gabapentin isn‚Äôt a gaba drug like ambien or klonopin.

873^ChiTownChick^gum^I know cigs are bad for your health but when I heard that the age had been raised I instantly got angry? Idk why. Maybe because I started smoking a month before my 18th birthday and then on my birthday I bought my first pack of cigarettes. I shouldn‚Äôt have been upset since I can obviously buy cigarettes now, but I sympathize with all the smokers who were suddenly  screwed. I‚Äôm sorry op. I tried to quit a couple times and it was horrible. The gum really does help though. The patches never did anything but the gum did. You‚Äôll get through this op. It‚Äôs better that quit now. I regret that I‚Äôve been a smoker for 14 years.

874^inthea215^opiates^Some normie meme because thinking that 

1) opiates make you hallucinate 

2) hallucinations often consist of dragons and seeing things that arnt there.

874^inthea215^opiates^It‚Äôs def not uncontrolled it‚Äôs either schedule 4 or 5. 

But soma is very easy to get from overseas like India. It seems to be similar to how tramadol is easy to get but not anything stronger. 

I know there‚Äôs occasionally people on the darknet that resell their Indian shit if you don‚Äôt want to deal with customs. 

Also the stuff is for sure not totally safe. You can totally overdose and fairly easily when mixed with other drugs like opiates and benzos. Also it may cause seizures. I‚Äôm not too familiar with it. But I‚Äôve heard a few stories of people trying to make their opiates stronger with it and then getting so fucked up they can‚Äôt speak or become unconscious

874^inthea215^opiate^Don‚Äôt worry too much. But yeah it‚Äôs pretty bad sadly many peoples opiate addictions get pretty crazy. People have managed to get through fent. 

I would def talk to a doctor ASAP. You could go to rehab and they‚Äôll get you through it. 

If I‚Äôm remembering right u4 is similar strength to oxy. It‚Äôs a lot but back when pill mills were popping in Florida people got up to 600+ mg a day. I‚Äôm sure some people have been where you are and made it but you need to get help.

874^inthea215^opiates^I can‚Äôt even imagine what being on meth feels like while dopesick fuck that. I personally get sooo tense and uncomfortable while on lots of stims. I always need benzos or opiates to mellow it out

874^inthea215^opiate^So you took an unknown amount of strong synthetic opiate with a massive blackout amount of benzos. 

I don‚Äôt mean to be offensive but dude do you want to live? Because if so I highly recommend you changing the way you live. Don‚Äôt get me wrong there‚Äôs plenty of people using dangerous drugs here but you seem to have such disregard for your own safety.

874^inthea215^opiates^People keep saying the naloxone keeps you from getting high but it‚Äôs really the bup. If you took generic bup it would work the same as subs. It‚Äôs binds to the receptors tighter than most other opiates preventing you from getting high. It also binds tighter than the naloxone meaning it‚Äôs pretty much ineffective.

874^inthea215^opiate^Over time dealers come across people with scripts and buy there shit to resell. Pretty simple. 

Currently tho pain pills are not ‚Äúflooding our streets‚Äù if you want to see that go back before 2012 when the pill mills in Florida we‚Äôre running and before the news started it‚Äôs hysteria over the ‚Äúopiate epidemic‚Äù 

Right now we have a fent epidemic or better yet I would say were in the middle of a synthetic epidemic. Meth has been constantly raising even more than opiates now that they cracked down on pills. The real issues are fent being sold in all the pills and heroin and meth and spice

876^Desilae^opiates^Right. And a lot of people sell RC's saying it's Xanax, acid, or opiates. Mdma too, but usually if people sell bunk mdma it's just meth. It's just to make money and it's despicable. 

Rules of thumb: don't buy from someone you don't trust or who seems sketchy, and even if you do trust them, test it. Testing kits are cheap online.

876^Desilae^opiates^I'm happy for you man. It sounds like you went through hell, but you came out on top.

Personally i feel like I need someone queued up to smash my face with a brick everytime I do opiates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
877^TrainerCalypso54^toys^I‚Äôm sorry that you have been so worn down by something you cannot control. It‚Äôs not your fault, and the only thing you can control about this situation is how you react to it.

PIV sex is only a portion of the sexual experience as a whole. I would recommend becoming comfortable with toys if you‚Äôre not already. If it‚Äôs really that much of a mental tax and don‚Äôt feel as if you are satisfying your partner (which I can almost guarantee would be an issue more in your head than someone who truly cares about you), you can always have a special strap on made to fit you that could extend the length. 

I can understand why it would be damaging mentally, but what you need is someone who loves you for you and is open to communication, then nothing else matter

880^Punchingbloodclots^toys^Guys look at pics though! I'd have it obvious in your 6th Tinder pic. If you don't want a pic of you and your kid on a dating app, you could take a picture of you enthusiastically surrounded by lots of kid toys. Or make sure you mention it asap when chatting to not waste your emotional energy.

880^Punchingbloodclots^chocolate^FYI if you're making these and have never melted chocolate in the microwave before, go low and slow. 2min 50% power for melting chocolate. It burns in the microwave easily. Stop to stir it frequently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
881^Harrypc95^opiate^I mean, mushrooms are infinitely more intense than weed? So you‚Äôve already jumped the gun there.

But if you haven‚Äôt smoked weed much already then just stick with that. You‚Äôre in for a lot of fun, but don‚Äôt believe all the ‚Äòit‚Äôs not addictive‚Äô ‚Äòit‚Äôs not detrimental‚Äô hype. Like any substance, if you abuse it, it will abuse you. 

The next step I‚Äôd go for is the benzo class. Preferably Valium (Xanax is a bit dangerous imo) - it gets you to a really nice & chilled out level, and isn‚Äôt too disruptive, but again it can be addictive. 

If you‚Äôre looking to feel genuinely amazing, then MDMA. Make sure it‚Äôs clean, should look like brown sugar. 

If you‚Äôre looking to feel something unique: ketamine. 

If you want to trip, but in a more euphoric way than mushrooms: LSD

If you want to break open the universe: DMT / Mescaline / Ayahuasca 

If you want to freak the fuck out: MXE / DXM

If you want to become heavily addicted: opiates 

If you want to feel uncomfortably detached from reality briefly in a way that makes no sense: Salvia 

If you want a weird lucid but sedative feeing: diphenhydramine

If you want pure sedation with a touch of euphoria: codeine (an opiate tho) 

If you want the craziest auditory hallucinations: Diisopropyltryptamine 

If you want a stimulant which isn‚Äôt really all that psychoactive: Kratom (Low dose) - or high dose for sedation 

If you want to feel incredibly confident and that you‚Äôre the most important person on earth: cocaine 

If you want to feel bee‚Äôs In your teeth: meth 

If you want to lose your mind for a while: PCP or other bath salts 

If you want to get a stranger to withdraw & give you all their money without them remembering: give them some scopolamine

882^liveinsanity010^china^Don't watch the olympics either than. Both sides need to compromise and work this out. Why is it that the NHL is automatically the bad guys here?

Edit: On top of this, I really personally do not want the NHL to go to China. Fuck the Chinese government, look at how they make the NBA bend their knee..or any business that is in China but also worldwide.

882^liveinsanity010^china^I really don't think that the NHL should try to grow the game into China. I don't want the NHL to have to concede to Chinese government demands.

883^vman411gamer^black^Well this makes me sad. I'm on my third, and I need to get it RMA'd too, but I really like the stealth black version. But yea, 2/3 of mine have had the latch break. Stupid piece to make plastic. The savings from making it plastic guaranteed to have cost them in the long run with RMAs though. Still, I just want a stealth black MV1 that lasts as long as my Crafty did.

Right now I am tying a shoe lace around my MV1 to fix the broken latch because I don't want to be without it lol

885^VoidShaman25^opioid^I don't mean every plant, you can't for example create a chemical purely synthetic that is as safe as cannabis (look at spice/k2 for example). There's also no human made opioid that is as safe as kratom

886^Tra5hAng3l^china^Dude you're puking cause you have no tolly and you're sniffing fentanyl. 

Stay away.


PS My first go was #3 and second was the china white. Street fetty is shit and even the CW wasn't that great compared to the 3. Addiction happens fast and esp with the heavy shit you're fucking with. I started in June and was at the point where banging less than half a point feels like nothing by august

886^Tra5hAng3l^china^Honestly real H is hard to get nowadays and almost always China White is Fent, a few hours is normal for fent but H is 12+ if it's good. 
Definitely keep that mindset it's too easy to justify it to yourself and it doesn't help for long with mental shit. it stops working and you need more to get to be not in pain and that's not even counting getting sick. And stay the fuck away from needles, that's a whole other demon in itself. Fuckin injecting anything just cause. No worries on the tangent thing I do it too lol.

890^spinderella69^opiates^Opiates arent entirely harmless. They wreak havoc on the endocrine system, cause extreme constipation, which in itself can cause health problems, are disruptive to mental health for many people, opiates arent as damaging physically as some other drugs are, but they arent totally harmless

890^spinderella69^opiate^Tweakers look down on opiate addicts, opiate addicts look down on tweakers, everyone looks down on crack heads, and pot heads think they are superior over everyone. At the end of the day we're all just trying to get high and get by, and instead of judging and hating each other, we should have each others backs. We already get enough hate from "normal" people, we shouldnt be hating each other

890^spinderella69^opiates^You dont have anything physically wrong with you so Doctors arent going to give you opiates, its really that simple. Doctors dont care that claim you are in pain from your job, anyone can claim that they have pain from a job and be given pills if that was the case. You need to actually have something physically wrong with you for you to get pills. Get a new job and stop trying to use it as an excuse to get pills to get high.

890^spinderella69^opiate^Opiate addiction or a job? No doctor is going to sign you up for opiate addiction, cmon now.

892^AntiqueVictory^opioid^[Here‚Äôs a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/cubvxg/please_please_test_your_drugs_every_single_time/exszez2/) about the time I OD‚Äôd. But it doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot to explain what it actually felt like. So I‚Äôll do that right now. 

I was addicted to a research chemical opioid at the time. I got a new batch, did a bump, and within 3 minutes knew something was drastically wrong. I did the bump, started getting high, but then it kept going, to the point where it was uncomfortable and I didn‚Äôt feel good. Then I pretty quickly started feeling nauseous. I spent like a solid hour throwing up, even when I had nothing in my stomach. When I wasn‚Äôt throwing up, I was sitting on the edge of my bathtub. And I remember feeling really tired. And my friend would snap at me, and try to get me to stay awake. And I remember saying something like ‚Äúfuck guys, I‚Äôm just really tired, let me sleep‚Äù. But (and I realized later), if I‚Äôd gone to sleep, I wouldn‚Äôt have woken up. I remember feeling my breathing get really *really* shallow. It was a weird feeling. I was too out of it to really process what was happening. But in retrospect, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was feeling my body trying to shut down. My friends were there with me, keeping me awake. When I stopped throwing up, they‚Äôd take me outside and walk around with me. I remember just being really out of it. Almost as if I was really wasted. But I just remember being really fucking tired. Finally I started feeling better. And all but one of my friends left, and the one who stayed did so to watch over me while I finally got a little bit of sleep (the whole thing started at like 10pm and didn‚Äôt end until the sun was rising, and I had work at 8am), to make sure I didn‚Äôt die. I woke up around 7:30am, dazed but better. But it took a while before the severity of what happened really sunk in. If you have further questions, ask me or /u/roreads - he was there and he was the one who stayed with me until the morning. I owe that fucker my life.

892^AntiqueVictory^opiates^Yeah man, I don‚Äôt know if you read my original post I linked to but I got super lucky. If my friend hadn‚Äôt showed up when she did, I would have done a second bump and been toast. Sounds like you got similarly lucky. 

I hate to break it to you, man, but the vendor didn‚Äôt shut down his page. The market did after he got enough complaints. He was cashing out. He probably was out of U47, and just sending out 4-FBF until enough complaints accumulated that his page was banned. Because - and I remember - the page was banned. But by that time, he‚Äôd already made a fucking profit off shit that was killing people. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting but that‚Äôs how the illegal drug trade is. And that‚Äôs how I learned the hard way to always test my shit. 

I hope the rehab goes well. I‚Äôve been clean from opiates for a little over a year now, with no intention of ever going back. I hope good things for you, man. Please always feel free to hit me up if you ever want to talk about shit. It‚Äôs not very often I get to speak to someone who went through literally the exact same thing I did.

892^AntiqueVictory^opiates^Yeah I understand her (faulty) reasoning tbh. I‚Äôm sure she was as anxious about the idea of having to call paramedics or go to the hospital or whatever as I was (because that‚Äôs just who she is). And yeah I don‚Äôt necessarily feel bad about her leading that shit because she did a lot more experience with opiates than anyone else, plus she dated her ex, the EMT. She knew more about how to handle that than most people (and it was good y‚Äôall were on the phone with him at the same time too). 

But yeah ultimately, kids, don‚Äôt risk that shit. I should have taken the narcan at the very least. Now I‚Äôve got 3 or 4 of those things stashed away, despite the fact I don‚Äôt know anyone who does dope anymore. But you can never be too careful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
893^Reddi5or^black^Goes to show that things aren't black and white, just different shades of gray. Sure, a man saved a life, but that same man is a racist piece of shit. Is he a good or bad person? Does he eat at the Lord's table, or does he dance with Lucifer in the Pale's Moon Light?

893^Reddi5or^black^Nothing more lame than a white guy getting outraged on behalf of black people. If there's a black person who has a problem with Blind Fury let them take it up with him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
894^SerenityTranquilPeas^dreams^Nsfw response: Oh yeah, that's withdrawal symptoms. You may even start having wet dreams. I am an alcoholic and similair things happened. I guess I got so used to "orgasming" when I was drunk, I forgot what a real one felt like. 3rd day of tapering, I almost passed out I came so hard after 30 seconds. My entire body became goosebumps and this pleasureable sensation crept across my entire body as my vision was flooded with staticy colors. In layman's terms, your body is so used to being numb all the time, when it finally begins waking up, it goes into overdrive. Your libido is suppressed for so long, you get a rebound effect. Kinda like when you smoke weed for months every day when you eventually quit, you experience REM rebound and you have crazy dreams.

894^SerenityTranquilPeas^dreams^Sorry for the late reply. Your sleep cycle is affected by marijuana and a lot of other drug usage. Basically you have stages of sleep, and the one where your mind is most active is called REM sleep. I'm no expert on it, but it is the stage where dreams happen. By missing(through drugs or other means) this stage you kinda build a debt with your mind. The more your body is forced to forgo this stage, the longer that stage lasts. I've noticed the effects from not smoking 6-8 hours before sleep, but complete sobriety produces the best results. It is not pleasant and you'll find yourself waking up constantly at seemingly random times after having the most vivid and insane dreams of your life. A 30 minute period of sleep can feel like ages. At least that is what happened to me, but it is a widely felt phenomenon and a quick google search will show you hundreds of similair stories.

895^therealxannyphantom^opioid^I've personally never done it but heres something I found on the internet 

Percocet and Vicodin both bind opioid receptors and depress the central nervous system. And both drugs can cause serious side effects if taken at higher dosages. Overdose of either Percocet or Vicodin can result in dangerous outcomes that include:1-2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
896^al_eberia^china^Probably trash. Multiple colors of the same press are almost always a bad sign, it means people are making small batches. Small batches means a small crew or even just one guy in his basement, who are much less likely to have a solid source of MDMA rather than meth or research chemical garbage sourced from China.

896^al_eberia^opiates^Depends entirely on what drugs and your location. The main drugs that tend to be pricier are stuff like cocaine and heroin, where much of the cost is due to having to smuggle them from producer countries. 

The other thing that tends to be more expensive are certain prescription drugs. I wrote up a little explanation about why:

>Why are some prescriptions so expensive on DNMs? It's because you can't obtain it in bulk, unless you are robbing a pharmacy (bad idea). The vendors selling it are folks selling their own prescriptions, or someone who is buying a few prescriptions from people in their area. So the supply of pills is limited, but the market of people who want to buy it is in the thousands, because anyone around the country or the world can buy from the vendor. Low supply and high demand means high prices. 

>This is mainly for schedule 2 substances like stimulants or opiates. Other pharmaceuticals can be sourced from countries like India, where regulations are much more relaxed. However opiates and stimulants are heavily controlled throughout most of the world, so there are no easy sources (of prescription quality, you can get plenty of heroin or meth).

896^al_eberia^china^A clearnet US vendor killed 11 people by sending out fentanyl asn 4-FA. So yes, it happens.

>According to the allegations in the indictment, on March 12, 2016, BROUSSARD placed a drug order for 100 grams of 4-FA, a controlled substance, which was shipped from China and contained approximately 100 grams of fentanyl. Between April 1 and April 27, 2016, BROUSSARD sent packages containing fentanyl to multiple customers throughout the United States. After ingesting the controlled substance received from BROUSSARD, eleven of the customers died from a fentanyl overdose and four customers suffered serious bodily injury.

Test them and find out though.

896^al_eberia^black^>the chances of getting caught

Very low

Pretty much guaranteed. People aren't lining up at retail stores to buy carts to flip, you are getting grey market or black market carts.

897^therealillist1^opiate^I'd choose methadone over any opiate any day, you nod harder and longer for sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
898^mycelium-magic^opiates^Thank you both for the genuine concern. I want to to seek out therapy, detox and rehab it‚Äôs just difficult to tell the people in you life something like this when they‚Äôve been unsuspecting of it the whole time. 

I know that I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. I think to myself ‚Äúi don‚Äôt even want to be doing this anymore‚Äù as i do it and continue to make excuses.

It‚Äôs like i set my mind on the straight and narrow and somehow throughout the day it twists and warps and takes over my actions and i proceed to use these drugs. 

I‚Äôm deff going to come clean with my mom about where I‚Äôm at right now. She knows about my past substance use and was a user herself (honesty she really got me hooked when i sprained my ankle at 14 and gave me a Vicodin for the first time. I wanted to feel like that forever) she‚Äôs been clean off her d.o.c. which are benzos and opiates. The Apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree in this case.

It‚Äôs my grandparents who i live with I‚Äôm having a hard time coming clean about this with. They are in their late 70‚Äôs and completely still all there. My grandma is a saint, god bless her soul, i know i could tell her and she would understand and my grandpa would understand too, it‚Äôs just.... how disappointed in me he will be and honestly kinda pissed cuz they both have done a lot for me and still decide to choose drugs over everything else. 

Even when they make me blackout and wake up with a broken nose, vomit on my shirt and no memory of what even happened the night before (NYE 2017) Even when they make me slur and stumble in front of my little brother and sister who look up and adore me. Even when they are the sole reason i can not save a dime. I always go back to them.

All to avoid one thing. Being alone with myself. Descending into the shame, guilt and cringe of my past. Fearing for what the next day holds and how fucked sideways it will be given to me. The weight on my shoulders of 7 digits of student loan debt from one year of university. 
 
Another effect, caused by drugs. If i would have focused on school instead of partying I‚Äôd have a completely different life right now. I‚Äôve quite fucked my future too for as of now until i get all this debt paid off.

Oh yes and the sweet sweet ptsd and intrusive suicidal ideation. Look at this, I‚Äôm not ignorant or blind or naive to my case. 

I know how about getting myself fixed, the steps i need to take to make myself a better man. Though i have no motivation to take them.

Like two sides of my mind battling each other. Logic and positivity always seem to lose to depression and impulsiveness. 

That‚Äôs what makes it worse, i wish i was ignorant to this all and blind to how my actions affected my future and relationships with my peers, family and ex-girlfriends.

I don‚Äôt even remember who i really am. I also fear sobriety is like a false prophet. What if I‚Äôm still depressed? What if i still get those suicidal urges i pray and wish and beg to be banished from my mind for eternity, yet they... always... come... back. Always.

Is my life worth living? Yes. Yes it is. There is no question.

Except for that one that won‚Äôt leave my head.

898^mycelium-magic^opiates^That actually sounds like a nice combo... i usually take 25-50mg if dph anyways when using good opiates to keep away the itch. I‚Äôm curious how the dxm added to the experience i might add some into the mix right now.

I‚Äôve taken a couple line of a fent press fake 30 and two Xans thinking about adding 50mg dph and 100mg dxm.

900^zipthalip1243^opiates^It‚Äôs simple, different people react differently to weed.  It also changes over time.  For me I smoked weed and loved it, never had anxiety issues, got pretty heavy into opiates and kept smoking no issues, after being clean for a few years (still on kratom) and still can enjoy weed.  With all that said I did have times through all this where I could get anxiety or have a bad weed ‚Äútrip‚Äù from smoking too much in a sitting.  It‚Äôs really easy to overdo the weed if you have no tolerance. Not saying you should but have you ever just tried taking the tiniest hit of weed?

900^zipthalip1243^china^In the US, biggest reasons for me are it‚Äôs hard to find a trusted vendor, chance of getting inactive or mislabeled powder, having to pay bitcoin and waiting for shipping from China / Canada.  and when I can get robocough or extract 5.4g of dxm for about $25, it‚Äôs hard to justify buying a boatload of powder especially since I don‚Äôt use it that often.

900^zipthalip1243^opiates^Not really.  After sitting for years the potency may go down slightly but it probably won't be noticeable.  For example a couple years ago I found 17 years past expiration pharmaceutical opiates, they worked just fine.

900^zipthalip1243^china^Couple reasons, firstly its hard to find trusting reviews of your website, this post sort of comes across as shilling to me.  But otherwise Robocough is US based and accepts credit card and has fast shipping.  Your website accepts bitcoin and ships from china so will take a while.  Also min order for dxm is $80, robocough min order is like $15 or less.  And BTW this might break reddits no sourcing rule but not sure

&#x200B;

Edit: per sidebar no sourcing of raw powder, this will get taken down most likely

900^zipthalip1243^opiate^Part of me wishes I felt that way from it, the other part is glad I don't.  If I could feel a strong opiate buzz from something as cheap as DXM, I would be in trouble.

900^zipthalip1243^opiate^Have to recommend Kratom or an opiate, Kratom has worked too well for me before to where I could not even finish! If you don‚Äôt take too much you can last as long as you want pretty much

901^daw-nee-yale^dreams^I'm excited for Phil Wickham at Lakewood Church [this weekend](https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugz8pBdyaj4fqVFSEQt4AaABCQ).

[Running Over](https://www.joelosteen.com/Pages/Blog.aspx?blogid=14224):  
>In Psalm 23, David says, "My cup runs over." When you pour water into a cup, you stop when the cup is full. You're limited by the cup's size. But God says, "When I pour out a blessing, I'm not limited by your capacity to receive." Our dreams and our cup of faith may be small. If God only blessed us according to how much we believe, we would be limited. If it was just up to us, we would never see the promise of Ephesians 3:20: "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think." But God is so good, He says, "Even when you have a little cup of faith, that's not going to stop Me from the big blessing I have in store." Get ready. He's not going to stop pouring at the top of your cup. He's going to give you a running-over blessing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
902^junkyjesus2020^opiate^Oxycodone has a high like no other opiate. Its that sedated feeling but wrapped in a warm blanket with a very nice energetic buzz.

I'm not sure on why it's this way in comparison to other opiates but it is.
Word of warning tho your tolerance shoots up super quick

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
903^slowdeine^gum^Just for future reference, you should really do more research in the future, especially with a drug like MDMA.

1. 80mg-100mg should be a good dose, considering we don't know how much you weigh.
2. Bomb it. Snorting it will make it kick in quicker but it won't last as long and it's painful and damaging.

Now, things to keep safe:

* Drink no more than 1-2 cups of water per hour (0.5-1 pints of water)
* Don't mix it with anything else, including alcohol (also, before you take it, are any of you on medication?).
* Keep yourselves cool, to prevent overheating.
* You're gonna want some chewing gum, too.
* Make sure you get a good sleep after.
* Don't use MDMA preferably for at least 3 months, otherwise you may deal damage to your brain.

903^slowdeine^gum^Did you have some gum? Take a look at magnesium supplementation in the future. [Here's a good guide on supplements for MDMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation/).

I suggest you have some soup or noodles to eat. If that's too difficult, at least drink some sugary drinks to get some calories in. Perhaps look at some ulcer cream that contains an anaesthetic, such as lidocaine. They're usually available over the counter.

903^slowdeine^gum^I think you'd seriously fuck your mouth up, especially since you can't really chew gum with braces. Fear not, however, there is a possible solution:

* Certain amino acid salts of magnesium, such as magnesium glycinate or lysinate, amongst others, will prevent gurning. Dosage really varies though, depending on where you look. Have a little dig around online, see what you can find.

905^aleden28281^china^The issue is the quarantines and barred travel which are severely affecting trade and global supply chains. Would you rather have officials release these restrictions and allow the virus to spread? And you should know better than to believe the numbers that China reports at this point lol.

905^aleden28281^china^China‚Äôs economic growth is already slowing and manufacturing from there is looking weaker too. This virus is definitely going to have a major impact on their economy for at least Q1 and it‚Äôs going to cause some major supply chain disruptions. But for now, investors are still in that ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù mentality, so until the public gets certifiable proof that the situation in China is a lot worse than what it appears, it looks like people might just continue buying up equities.

905^aleden28281^china^U gotta be careful when China opens its markets. They‚Äôre for sure gonna tank, I‚Äôm worried that it will bring down the S&P with it.

905^aleden28281^china^I mean, Chinese markets have been closed since the 23rd I believe and in that time the Hang Seng and Taiwan markets have tanked even more. I should think that China would follow, with probably more intensity. You‚Äôre welcome to take the opposite position tho lol.

905^aleden28281^china^$YANG is a 3 times leveraged bear ETF against 50 largest Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong. It‚Äôs a good way to get big moves against China‚Äôs economy in specific, because while other markets might not be hit as hard or at all by this virus, China‚Äôs definitely will be. I guess you could buy puts on something like $SPXL but again, I think it is a lot smarter and more rewarding to bet against China‚Äôs economy right now.

905^aleden28281^china^That‚Äôs moreso to help mitigate the damage, not reduce it completely. Think about it, in the time that the Chinese markets were closed, Hong Kong and Taiwan markets tanked several percent. It‚Äôs only gonna be worse for China.

906^elvenrunelord^chocolate^For whatever reason I started out my cooking journey with "The Frugal Gourmet" as well. It was the cook show equal to Bob Ross's painting show. Happy little meals so to speak.

I guess that was the start of my cooking adventures.

Today me and some friends went out to eat at a local Golden Corral. To be blunt, the food sucked. Well rather the meal sucked. The chocolate chess pie I had for dessert was pretty damn tasty but the rest of the food was subpar at best and gross at worst. Another friend of mine who like me never salts anything found himself reaching for the salt a few times during this meal as neither one of us found any satisfaction with the taste of the food.

After all reading your post it occurred to me that I've grown to like my own cooking better than the majority of restaurants now. I remember going to Golden Corral many years ago with my mother and we both enjoyed their food a lot. Not anymore. I would rather spend that $12 and make something amazing at home I can eat and freeze the left overs for at least one and sometimes two extra meals. And I'll enjoy it more on top of that.

I boil all this down to my skills at cooking.

I will disagree with the OP on one thing. Some of those ramen flavor packets are good. Maybe not the best for ramen but good for other seasoning. I in particular enjoy the  [Maruchan Ramen Chicken Tortilla](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Maruchan-Ramen-Chicken-Tortilla-3-oz/152206072) flavor and the  [Maruchan Ramen Noodle Soup Chili Flavor](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Maruchan-Ramen-Noodle-Soup-Chili-Flavor-3-0-OZ/22086240) seasoning packs even if I don't use them in ramen itself. Although the chicken tortilla flavor with melted cheese added is very good in my opinion for a quick snack.

906^elvenrunelord^black^>Shin noodle bowl

Is the shin black actually worth the premium price? I mean the over $2 cost for a brick of ramen is pretty steep.

906^elvenrunelord^dreams^I mostly get individually wrapped tea bags that are well wrapped. Celestial Seasons is not well wrapped in my opinion while Bigelow teas seem to last forever. I've opened packs of Bigelow Sweet Dreams tea bags that were over 4 years old and they seemed as fresh as any I have opened right after buying them.

906^elvenrunelord^black^That was not innocent black man he sprayed on that was the bottle next over. He must have grabbed "Thug Life Cologne"

906^elvenrunelord^black^I just checked my local walmart and the shin black bricks are cheaper by the 4-pack than 4 cups of the red would be.

907^purppuma^opiate^I‚Äôve only been able to get this stuff once.  I know it was real since it‚Äôs a fairly unknown opiate, without a very big demand.  I took it during school back when I was still in high school.  It‚Äôs also fair to mention I had smoked weed that day too, which added to it.  I kept getting those dream like nods like you mentioned, and then when I woke up I was seeing stars and shit.  It was intense, but not many people knew I was fucked and just assumed I was tired.

913^Thesechudsareduds^opiates^There have been *plenty* of posts from people here that went CT off of high doses of kratom, talked about weeks of grueling withdrawal and sleepless nights only to relapse shortly after they‚Äôre out of the woods. I probably see at least one post per day outlining that exact experience. So your tough guy suffering regimen clearly isn‚Äôt the magic bullet you seem to think it is. Statistically, people that CT from opiates are several times more likely to relapse than people that use medication treatments to quit.

You seem to suffer from a specific brand of lack of empathy that I sadly see in a lot of addiction support groups. You‚Äôre the ‚Äúmy way is the right way and anyone that does it differently is dumb and wrong‚Äù guy. This post definitely reeks of far more arrogance and misplaced impotent rage than I‚Äôm accustomed to seeing, so I suppose I‚Äôll have to give you credit for making the cliche your own.

This might be news to you, but everyone has different pain thresholds. Everyone has different experiences. For a lot of people, the fear of days to weeks of withdrawal keeps them trapped in the addiction well beyond the point they stop enjoying the high. Some people work 60 hours a week. Some people have children to care for. People have responsibilities that they are obligated to and don‚Äôt have the option of carrying them out in full blown withdrawal.

If you remove all of the tropes you‚Äôre ‚ÄúSO TIRED OF1!!‚Äù from this sub, what would the point of it be? You‚Äôve basically outlined the entire point of this group, so not sure why you stuck around in the first place.

When you go to bed tonight and are reflecting on your day, be sure to think about the fact that you dedicated a huge chunk of time typing out a temper tantrum meant for a bunch of people that are already going through a rough time. I hope you are able to work out your anger issues and become someone that has more empathy for others, this kind of misguided rage is typically only found in people that are fundamentally unhappy with themselves. Probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt to make an appointment with a mental health counselor.

913^Thesechudsareduds^china^Because Fox News tells them that affordable health care will turn us into Soviet Russia or China. All they need to do is repeat the words ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù and ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and their audience will clutch their pearls with trembling hands and vote for the guy that cuts their social security and gives tax cuts to billionaires.

913^Thesechudsareduds^china^It isn‚Äôt racist to be skeptical of a government that is committing genocide, holding over a million prisoners without cause and trying to wipe out their faith. I know that for me at least, I‚Äôm critical of China because I feel horrible for its citizens that are essentially stuck under authoritarian rule.

This is what I understand about China‚Äôs government:

-	Aforementioned concentration camps and genocide 
-	constantly violating the rights and privacy of its citizens through mass surveillance
-	Commits corporate espionage to steal intellectual property and bolster their economy will undermining the economy of other countries 
-	Raping and killing protesters 

If this is all just western racism, can you show me independent sources that debunk these things?

913^Thesechudsareduds^china^Interesting that you‚Äôve been white knighting for China in numerous threads over the last few days. That‚Äôs not suspicious at all.

915^therealogbrahh^opiates^I had to stop using because of this problem. I put down the needle after a decade and picked up a stem. Not a great trade off believe me. I never understood cocaine addiction because you can't withdraw from it like my DOC opiates. The struggle is real.
Edit: it used to take me upwards of a half hour to an hour to hit once and sometimes I wouldn't be able to hit period. Nothing like blood all over your body, track marks for days, and wasted speedballs that cost ~$40 a shot.

916^soberasfuck^black^Carefully thought out ideas? 

His offensively named Douglass plan is awful. It is meant to help minorities gain forgiveness for their student loans, but requires them to start a business after college that employs at least three people. How many poor people who received Pell Grants and student loans will be able to afford to start a business right after college, let alone one successful enough to employ three people?? Almost nobody. So this plan being held up as an example of how he is ‚Äúlooking out for black people‚Äù is outrageous.

Also, they lied about receiving support from hundreds of people! His campaign sent out an email and if people *didnt* respond, the campaign took that as support and added their names. That is unbelievably unethical and dishonest. So many black community leaders were shocked to see their names attached to a plan that they didn‚Äôt support, put forth by a candidate they didn‚Äôt support either. 

This is just one example. Pete Buttigeig is not an honest person. He is using every slimy trick he can to get elected. I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt see straight through this.

916^soberasfuck^opiates^8ball of what substance? Any stimulant I can think of would kill him at that dose, so would most opiates and downers. Also, anything I can think of would taste atrocious and be extremely noticeable in a drink at that large of a dose.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
917^Nineteen_oh_two^opiates^Opiates that are cheap? I mean codeine is out there. You've chosen the wrong DOC for value, honestly.

917^Nineteen_oh_two^opiates^I am sorry you're in pain. Your dad shouldn't have thrown them away, obviously. But I understand why he did, even though it's an overreaction. I'm a parent myself and I would be terrified if my son was prescribed vicodin at such an early age (living at home I assume you're minor). Rationally, he probably should have just held on to them and doled them out as necessary.

A lot of comments are along the lines of you can't get hooked on opiates from getting ten. Again I can only speak from personal experience, but I was prescribed vicodin at 17 and immediately decided I wanted more of that feeling. 2 decades later, 3 inpatient rehabs, 4 times narcan'd, countless NA meetings and literally tens of thousands of dollars wasted...and yet I still am hooked. I'd do anything in my power to stop my son from going down this path.

917^Nineteen_oh_two^opium^Haha I didn't think of it but that's a very good point about the right kind of opium producing poppies. I hope this guy isn't growing California poppies and going to all that effort...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
918^squirlasmr^opiates^Yeah, I've done that. You're not addicted to other opiates right now, right? I dont want you to get precipitated withdrawal.

918^squirlasmr^opiates^I used to love taking opiates after a workout annd my body would be so noodley and relaxed. Now im an addict and barely excercise or play sports. :(

918^squirlasmr^dreams^The most worstest dreams are in withdrawal though. I swear I had a wet dream to an alien that was a sack of eyeballs and tentacle things.

918^squirlasmr^opiates^Lol im so tired pf trying to reeply with my horror storiea of how insane PWDs can get. Im terrified of subs,, and dont want my worst enemy to go through that. I really cant describe how horrible it was.

Then im seeimg people ask8mg "can i take a sub after my methadome" and im like OMG WTF. Then i sew other replies that say you get precips of you take opiates after subs.... which is opposite..... like we meed some resource on the wiiki or somethimg so people domt try this.... like suboxone is insane of done wromg

918^squirlasmr^opiates^I took my last fent analog friday or satday, took 2mg subs on wednesday... got PWD... thankfully it wasnt as bad as usually (pukimg yellow acid for days and death).... but idk maybe its just me... i cant do suboxome... mqybe my body is retarted or i have waaaay to mmuch opiates in my system ? Start slow, wait long. Severse precipitated withdrawal can feel like 24h nightmare,nplus a week being dead in bed.

This is just my experience. I have a phobia of subs now. I just switched to methadone today.

918^squirlasmr^dreams^I hate this the most. I have the weirdest dreams too, busting to the grossest or freakiest stuff. Worst part of withdrawal. I just wanna stay dry when withdrawing.

918^squirlasmr^opiate^I'm sure they dont keep inventory on these highly controlled addictive drugs during this whole "opiate epidemic" bs going on.

918^squirlasmr^black^That's clearly the writing slany of a black person. They probably are just more afraid of the popo. I doubt it's your fault.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
919^funkyastroturf^opiates^I have absolutely fucked my brain up with psychedelics, opiates, crack, ketamine and nitrous balloons. I mean my drug of choice was everything and more. I was severely suicidal (got on good meds) and depressed. Now I'm clean and in early recovery. I'm still depressed but just sort of numb. I fucked my life up though. I've been diagnosed with drug induced bi polar and major depressive disorder.

919^funkyastroturf^opiates^Oh I've been in and out of recovery my whole adult life. And you're right. It's not a great idea to be hanging out in drug subs when you're trying to stay clean. But drugs are all I know. They are always a passion whether or not I'm clean. But I've learned that opiates, alcohol and benzos are the only truly physically addictive substances. I never needed recovery until crack / heroin/ fentanyl came into my life. But this is how I get my "fix" without using. Although they do say if you hang out at a watering hole long enough you're bound to drink.

919^funkyastroturf^black^My loved ones know my stance on life well enough that I wouldn't need a note. I'm pretty stable on some good meds right now that have me pretty numbed out but I still have a very inviting stance on my own death. I explained to my mom who also suffers from depression just how miserable existence is for me. She's the only person I'd feel bad for but I've talked to her a bunch about it. I am one of those people who just tough it out due to the people in my life I feel I'd let down by killing my self. I've successfully reached the black nothing twice and was brought back to life both times. My mom cried about it the first time. But the second time she was sullen. My fianc√© however really felt betrayed and couldn't believe I'd leave her alone in life. That shit hit me hard. Now I just pray for death. I don't think I can kill myself due to the guilt.

921^griftylifts^black^You would've been 'black and blue for days' if you raised your voice to ask for water? Holy fuck

921^griftylifts^opiates^Your own experience is yours to speak on. 

You may not speak on what things to do "everyone else", you haven't walked a mile in their shoes. 

Some argue that cannabis makes you apathetic to pain as well. 

I disagree that either cannabis or opiates make one apathetic (not that it's a bad thing if they do) when used as prescribed - I also use cannabis, CBD oil, arnica extract, Epsom salt baths, and anything else that will give even fleeting relief, on top of my tramadol prescription. It's the combination, or rather the specific 'cocktail', tailored to each individual that works. 

You're very fortunate to be able to treat your pain without opiates - enjoy that, and come with gratitude instead of projection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
922^DamiensLust^opioid^So, full disclosure: she wasn't an "influencer", and it wasn't a photo shoot request, and I'm not a photographer, but there was this one time when the girl I was seeing was picking up a little extra cash by babysitting her niece, which was very, very easy money since her niece was 7 years old & an angel, super well-behaved. My partner's sister was married to a very wealthy guy, and so they hired a couple of cleaners who came in a few times a week to keep the place spick-and-span. 

A short while prior to the evening in question a non-trivial amount of money had gone missing out of the house, so they had installed some spy cams around the house as they wanted to catch the perpetrator rather than just firing everybody and hiring new people. 

Me & my partner had been together a couple of years at this point, and things needed to be "livened up" in the bedroom (the real cause of which was my opioid addiction that i'd been maintaining secretly, but that's another story). After she had put her niece to bed, we got close on the sofa, and one thing led to another & we ended up having sex. We went upstairs to the guest bedroom just so we'd be alerted if her sister came back early for some reason and she started rooting around for condoms. She found some - along with a bunch of sex toys, many of which looked new. One of these was a 6" inch strap-on. I was immediately less than enthusiastic about the prospect and my first excuse was that it can't possibly be hygienic to share something like that, but she pointed out that there were 4 different detachable dildos and 3 of them were still shrink-wrapped inside the box. 

I really wasn't up for it and had the situation been different I would have shot down the suggestion. But, the circumstances of our relationship meant that I was in dire-need of some good boyfriend credit - my habit at the time had meant I was emotionally & mentally distant which she had rightfully picked up on, and I could feel her mutually drifting away. I was becoming worried about losing her, since she was my anchor to a normal life and the one thing that had stopped me from jumping down the rabbit-hole head-first, and I just knew that if I lost her then I wouild spiral out of control. I also knew that her ex had been into a lot of S&M stuff and that he had taken her to a place called the torture garden and they'd done a lot of kinky shit together. Though I'd never have suggested it, or gone for it under normal circumstances, I figured that if gritting my teeth and clenching my fists while my girlfriend pounded me in the ass was the price to pay to stop the best part of my life from evaporating - then so be it. 

To keep it SFW, I'll spare the details. I will say though that it really wasn't as unpleasant as I expected and that my girlfriend was into it *a lot* more than I thought she would be. If I had been unsure before, afterwards I was certain that that wasn't her first rodeo! 

Anyway, we finished up, my girlfriend took the dildo (detached from the strap-on at my insistence), replaced it all, and we went back to watching TV until her sister came back. About a week later, having forgotten all about it, we were invited over for dinner. The two of them made quite a lot of ambiguous comments that I didn't think much of at first - "are you OK? you look like you're still sore", "Take a bigger piece if you want, DamiensLust. We know you love taking the meat" etc. We both started suspecting something at some point, and then 50 double entendre and innuendos later, the conversation got onto the money that went missing and my partner's brother-in-law said "We never found out where that money went. It was definitely taken, but whoever it was must have grown a conscience or maybe noticed the cameras. They're quite subtle though - you'd never know they were here, but they're all over the house. There's one over here, in the living room, in Carla's room, in *THE GUEST BEDROOM* - I bet you guys didn't see it at all last week, did you?" and then the two of them started laughing. 

Fortunately they both found it very funny. I was left a little red-faced but both of us apologized and took it as well as we could. After dinner my partner even asked if they wanted to play the video, and before I could say absolutely not they told us that it had been deleted after he had found it while reviewing the footage....after showing it to my partner's sister first, of course! So, not quite a photo shoot, but for a period of time quite an outrageous and embarrassing video of me existed, and I wonder from time to time if they really did delete it or if it still exists on their laptop. 

I know this was pretty distinct from the question the OP asked, and I figured that though it was pretty irrelevant, it's a story I've been waiting to tell and I figured i'd post it here where it will be buried but at least it will be off my chest.

927^Bluescorpion76^opiate^If you think about it, using is the worst thing you could do in that situation.  Life is gonna hand ya all kinds of problems in the future.  Hiding under an opiate blanket isn't gonna make those problems go away.  

Tackle this problem sober and you'll start a trend.  Pushing good habits to the forefront takes time, but it's the best policy.

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^I've read that you have issues with cluster-headaches.  I don't know if I would have come off opiates if I had to endure that type of pain myself.  You certainly have my sympathies.  

I feel like if I was in your shoes, I would ween down to a moderate dose and work on my discipline to keep that level.  I know it's a slippery slope and tough to keep a set dose for people like us, but if you don't want to quit and need pain relief, I'd say it's your best bet going forward.  

You're right, life shouldn't be that easy, but it shouldn't be that difficult either.  We only get the one life, I feel we should strive to make it count.  

Well wishes to you mate.  I hope you can figure things out and may your headaches be minimal .

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^Chance would be a fine thing.  

I don't dream that often and I don't remember them if I did.  I smoke a lot weed though and I've heard it hinders dreams for some reason or another.  

I did have my sex-drive go from stop to overdrive in a matter of two days quitting opiates though.  I'm still horny a lot more lately, but at least I'm not a one and done guy still.  

Just side note, humans aren't too different from each other.  Even the most embarrassing things are shared by most everyone to a degree.  Sad we can't be more open with each other.

927^Bluescorpion76^toys^I wish I was a boomer.  They got shit on lock and had a pretty sweet upbringing.  

I grew up in the 80s, so I don't feel cheated too much.  Now this current generation, damn, y'all are fucked.  

Y'all have some nice toys to be sure, but the security nowadays is awful.  I'm glad cameras weren't everywhere when I was young.  Can't imagine having my whole life recorded and photographed to be brought back up twenty years later to bite me in the ass!

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Since I've quit opiates, I've been drinking whiskey more and boy howdy, one needs to knock back a cool glass of water in between three and four shots.  If I neglect my hydration, I wake up with the worst hangover and it can last hours.

Stay safe out there peoples!  Also, OP, I hope you recover well.  Kidneys are workhorses, we should really take better care of them!

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^I think that tapering using weaker opiates is a good idea.  I don't know how well those hydrocodones are gonna help ya, but it's better to come down slowly than drop like a rock.

You're gonna be dope-sick for a few days at some point.  Don't be nervous, we all have to go through that at eventually.  If you really want to come off opiates, you're gonna have to rip that band-aid off eventually.  

Well wishes to you.  Just remember that after the withdrawals are over, you don't have to go through that again if you don't want to.

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^I miss reading and taking opiates!  I'm re-reading 'From Hell' in the MasterCraft version and I've forgotten how much I enjoyed Allan Moore's work.

To be fair, saying cops are assholes is as wrong as saying junkies are all worthless scum.  It's simply not true in either case.  Can't really paint any group with broad strokes.  I'd probably be in prison if not for some really cool cops, so I'm witness that there are good ones out there.

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^You sound like a good woman.  I appreciate your devotion to your SO.  I hope things change for you two and y'all can move on with life.  There is a lot of stuff out there that opiates aren't gonna allow you to do.  You just get the one life!

927^Bluescorpion76^opiates^Oh man, our junkie minds at work.  

There has been so many times I'd go through withdrawal purposely until I was over it, only to have my mind tell me, "wow, you went through a lot!  You need a break.  Why not take some opiates as a reward"?  

Damn it took it me quite some time to break that cycle.  At some point we all have to tell our minds to shut the hell up.

930^brodaki^china^You‚Äôre correct that westerners wrongly assume most Chinese hate their government but are simply afraid to speak out. They mostly love the CCP and their newfound prosperity after 100 years of economic misery and constant wars, atrocities and colonizations. And something like 40% of mainland China is still largely rural, where people are poor and uneducated. These people don‚Äôt even think about geopolitics. 

However you would be surprised, a lot of Chinese aren‚Äôt aware of tiannamen square massacre and things like that.

IMO, the government having public support makes the situation way worse. They‚Äôre completely willing to rationalize or overlook their own atrocities and unscrupulous practices, as they‚Äôre ideologically motivated. You can say the same thing about westerners blinded by patriotism, but the western liberal democracies actually have a semblance of accountability and balance of powers, even if it‚Äôs not perfect.

930^brodaki^china^You realize trump is the most hostile president to China in history, right? I have no idea how you could think that.

930^brodaki^black^Yeah, I won‚Äôt argue that the military, like all government programs, is disorganized and intentionally obfuscated to hide corruption and overspending and the funding of classified black ops that don‚Äôt technically exist. But there‚Äôs no way 21 trillion went missing. I mean isn‚Äôt the entire military budget like 1 trillion dollars?


Edit: it‚Äôs like 640 billion. There‚Äôs no way a number 35 times the budget disappeared.

930^brodaki^china^I‚Äôm sorry, what? There‚Äôs so much here. First of all, jews aren‚Äôt white and nearly every country in the world has a history/culture of anti-semitism. Jews having white-ish skin does not matter to any white person. White supremicists hate jews more than any other race. Also, what current laws are against native Americans? I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt exist, but if they do I‚Äôd like to be educated on that because I‚Äôve never heard of that. 

I‚Äôll accept china is killing Muslims indiscriminately, but the US? I imagine you‚Äôre talking about wars in the Middle East. There‚Äôs a big difference between genociding certain religions in your own country versus civilians dying as a byproduct of civil war. It‚Äôs horrible, but it has nothing to do with race or persecution. Look at the civil war in Serbia in the 90s, or literally any war involving white people ever. Civilians die. No one is indiscriminately killing those people because they‚Äôre white, just like no white people are indiscriminately killing brown people because they‚Äôre brown. In China, they actually are. 

You‚Äôre right about treating all Latin Americans the same because of the actions of a small minority. Same goes for Africa.

930^brodaki^black^I‚Äôm a drug addict. You know, the whole white people using drugs as much as black people but don‚Äôt get arrested as much is classic correlation /=/ causation. Hopefully I can speak to this a little bit. The obvious reason is that crime rates are higher among impoverished communities, and those communities tend to be concentrated with POC, those areas with higher crimes also have more policing. Putting police where the crimes take place is not racist, it protects those communities. 

The implication people make is that police are white supremacists, catch white people doing drugs, and then let them go because...they‚Äôre white. I can unequivocally tell you that is not the case. And I hate police as much as anyone. Seriously. 

People who do a lot of drugs typically carry drugs with them almost everywhere they go. If you‚Äôre doing other crimes because you‚Äôre poor, you‚Äôre going to get arrested. If the only crime you ever do is take drugs, you will likely never get arrested.

Culturally, you know what I‚Äôve seen consistently in every country and state I‚Äôve ever been to? Black people do drugs outside. White people do drugs indoors with the curtains drawn. Speaking as someone who has done hard drugs with like a thousand people of all kinds, and as someone who has been arrested and harassed and profiled many times by cops, while being white passing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
931^2ndwaveobserver^black^I‚Äôm a concrete finisher and yes on the final pass, a little water does make it a little easier but it also adds some quality as well. You can use a trowel machine to ‚Äúburn‚Äù the finish and it ends up super hard and more of a black color. When I finish by hand with a little water, it works up a really fine mud we like to call Aunt Mables Nut Butter lol but it gets into the smallest of holes and blemishes to make a perfect glaze across the top to the point that it shines and you can see a reflection in some places. The water actually colors the concrete as well. Gives it a beautiful grey finish and can get it so slick you can damn near eat off of it. We like to say ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt finished until you‚Äôre sharpening you trowel on it.‚Äù Some people think concrete is easy to finish but being able to stay with it and basically rub it until the very last possible minute of it completely setting is a real skill and to me an art. I can actually get into that zone where time doesn‚Äôt register in my mind. It‚Äôs hard work and isn‚Äôt the greatest on my body but I love knowing that I have one of the oldest trade skills known to man. Once I get to a full slick finish like on a basement floor, it‚Äôs already set enough on top to straight up walk or build on. The center is still curing though and it is actually still creating heat for up to 48 hours in the middle but the top is as hard as it can get. 

Fun fact, the Hoover dam has so much concrete that it‚Äôs STILL not done curing in the center and won‚Äôt be for possibly another 50 years at least from what I‚Äôve heard. I believe they said it‚Äôs so thick that it‚Äôll be curing for over 100 years. It‚Äôs crazy to think about.

931^2ndwaveobserver^opium^The thing is, besides the OD potential, opiates are not dangerous drugs. There has been no evidence to support any kind of organ damage from prolonged use of opiates alone. It‚Äôs the Tylenol in the lower dose pills that will kill you. The line between a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù dose of Tylenol and compete organ failure is tiny. Yet that shit is in every store in America and everyone takes it because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnon addictive‚Äù. Most people aren‚Äôt ready to have this conversation though so it‚Äôs whatever but the research is there. If someone had a regulated dose of of opium or morphine or pharm grade heroin, they could live a long, healthy, and pain free life.

931^2ndwaveobserver^opium^The only reason street heroin is ‚Äúbad‚Äù is because there are unknown cutting agents mixed in. Heroin actually originated in a lab made by Bayer. It‚Äôs basically just morphine that has been synthesized to be a lot stronger. Morphine is the first drug that is made from the poppy and the most basic besides opium.

Edit: to add to this, diacetylmorphine which is the real name of it, is still made in pharmaceutical grade labs to this day and can still be prescribed in a hospital. It‚Äôs extremely safe when administered properly. Most people die from accidentally overdoses when mixed with fentanyl and diseases associated with bad using practices, like hep C, HIV, and endocarditis.

931^2ndwaveobserver^opiates^I get it. Most of that behavior I‚Äôve only really seen from people who get on benzo binges like Xanax. I‚Äôve never seen opiates make people do shit like that and I spent years doing oxy and heroin. Now I‚Äôm not saying somebody in withdrawal won‚Äôt boost some shit but anyone I ever knew who would rob stores or break into cars and houses were strictly on Xanax. That shit will turn you into an animal with no care about anything. I never could do that stuff. I could literally take some and immediately wake up the next day. Knocks me straight out lol

931^2ndwaveobserver^china^Yeah China was already addicted. Even the empower was hooked and he outlawed it but the brits said ‚Äúno fuck you, you‚Äôre gonna keep making it and we‚Äôre gonna keep buying it‚Äù

932^Faxon^chocolate^Well experienced stoner, it definitely can have an effect. If you want to try something not in the mango family though, cardamom also contains high levels of myrcene as well as other phytochemicals. Eating a couple of raw cardamom pods when i haven't built up a tolerance to them is enough to take me down some nights. I need to bake a batch of cardamom spiced chocolate cookies (contains cardamom cinnamon and a few other spices) again as they always put me right out

937^yerdunclelarry^opiate^Loperimide and gabapentin saved me.  My idiot doctor tapered me wayyyy to fast and I was already withdrawaling at 2mg (was on 12 for over a year and much more before that).  He did it over 2 months.  I had the shits so bad I literally had to sit by the bathroom all day.  I also felt the Suboxone withdrawals are much harsher than morphine or H, unless.of course you're doing the comperable amount.  (8mg subs is equal to IVing 80mg of dilaudid or 200mg of regular morphine.  It's a very strong opiate.  Loperimide in higher does helps but don't use over 5 days or you won't shit for 2 weeks.lol.  gabapentin takes away the anxiety and restlessness, and I only used it for a week as gabapentin withdrawal can be bitch especially if taking high daily doses.

937^yerdunclelarry^opiate^Xanax is awful.for your mental health long term.  It says right on their end its a SHORT term fix.  I was prescribed benzodiazepines for years all different kinds Xanax, valium, lorazepam, clonazepam, tamazepam, and librium.  I tapered down to .25 for a couple months, after completing coming off I did.  It was 100x worse.than opiate withdrawal and I've shot alot of dope.  I would definitely recommend getting off them as in time it becomes very hard to get off

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
938^EthelWinters^opiate^Fent will not come up under opi panel they need a specific fent test but unless you did straight fent it was probably cut with another opiate.  The last time I was tested every opiate except heroin showed up fent included but that was a lab test and well as a like 12 or panel screen.  So glad I dont have to worry about this shit anymore stick with the subs my guy you'll be way better off in the long run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
939^NeverGoFullHOOAH89^china^Yep, my family owns a landfill and we pack 4-5 of these a month with copper, aluminum, cast iron and platinum. They definitely pay to ship direct to China.

940^FBIintern^black^If by hug you mean get Eminem to destroy the shit outta my tight mouth with his huge black cock, then yes, I want a hug very, very fucking much. Gimme.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
941^Marijuanaa^opiate^How do you like it? Do you have an opiate tolerances I also ordered some and it should be here in about 4 days give or take. I‚Äôm really excited, wish I had enough for some 2fdck but maybe another time :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
942^gethighbeforyoudie^china^2 weeks in Canadian customs is nothing. Id be concerned at the 5 week mark. This is why I avoid buying anything internationally if I need it some time this century. Especially China- they basically have to pretend every thing could have enough fentanyl to decimate canadas population

942^gethighbeforyoudie^opioid^Yeah another vote for Kratom, though I was jumping from 0.33mg of suboxone. And if you want to be totally substance free, I get that, and I was going to use Kratom to taper off completely but I love being on it at a small dose. 5g a day of red Bali (well, every 22 hours) and I feel great all day, with energy, and a positive disposition. Sort of like being on like 1.5mg of oxy with the energy of a Vyvanse but half as intense and twice as smooth. Like if I had the choice to wake up tomorrow and not be dependent on any opioid type substance and never be allowed to touch it again or keep taking it and be lightly dependent, I would stay on it.

942^gethighbeforyoudie^china^Or you could look at it as supporting the place that is fighting against China, but that's none of my business

943^reggayman^black^i was on adds + whatever SSRI of the month... after 5 years of adds and persistent anxiety i was asked, "how about a benzo?" and a downward spiral began---i wasn't too addicted. no shakes/seizures/etc (that I know of)---but id pretty much take the scrip' in a few days and black out/brown out weeks/month at a time. radicalü§ôü§ô

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
944^infinityflash^china^I started counting bites during that first meal to keep from shoveling food into my face. It's tedious, but I needed to do something to teach my brain/body that the food wasn't going to disappear if I didnt eat it right away. 15 bites before I swallow. Also, I had to unlearn that finishing the food on my plate was a requirement. 

If I'm full and there's 4 bites left on my plate? It's fine. I'll be fine. Kids in China aren't going to starve because I left half a chicken breast on my plate.  Tomorrow I'll get a smaller serving, and if I'm still hungry after a small serving tomorrow? I'm allowed to eat more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
945^akf2680^opiates^Well I don‚Äôt know about that,it‚Äôs just that I have detoxed so many times off opiates I guess It kinda didn‚Äôt phase me too much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
946^saymynamebastien^chocolate^Is it expired?! That's so weird! Maybe it got mixed too much and it started forming into chocolate butter or ice cream?

946^saymynamebastien^black^Right? By the time he finds a safe place for his kids, his wife is already down. This isn't nearly as black and white as they seem to think it is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
947^Oxynod^opiates^I‚Äôm in twice weekly therapy as well as a combination of 4 different psych meds. Maybe it‚Äôs more than opiates - maybe it‚Äôs not. But I definitely felt a happiness and pleasure on them that I no longer feel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
948^fancylamp12^black^you can interpret it how you want i don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre trying to pick apart my story like a lawyer. i‚Äôm not bringing him to trial i even said he likely didn‚Äôt rape me and that i was confused because i was on drugs and couldn‚Äôt fully comprehend what happened. this is probably a third of what happened because ambien makes you black out. we all took ambien and it was a dumb idea but the ambien wasn‚Äôt mine i just worded it wrong so you can calm down

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
949^Dank167^opiate^Exactly if you‚Äôre in a relationship BEFORE your addiction WAYYY different emotional feeling to know you‚Äôre stressing over getting a fix and if your gf might be ranting or trying to talk about her day you might just nod like you‚Äôre listening but be crying inside knowing you can‚Äôt switch that damn thought of ‚ÄúI need a pill, like, shot, whatever opiate you do and however you do it‚Äù

I cry to my gf and say sorry once a month over her still loving and putting up with me. 

Fellas, if you got a women who has NO idea what opiate addiction really is or feels like but she still loves and takes care of you she REALLY cares about your life and quality as a person.

Ladies same thing, if your guy never struggled with it but is still by your side or even help you get it, he loves you as much as it hurts him to grab it.

It‚Äôs true facts. Even thought my girl gets fed up and if we have a argument go to far and that junkie word slipped out. She always said sorry as soon as she realized she was going there. I‚Äôm on subs but I might relapse I‚Äôm out now.. and she know and she‚Äôll still be here but I still break my own heart continuing this lifestyle. 

I was better than this before I used to do anything for her cause I had money a car 2 jobs. Now I have 1 job and most my money goes to bills and subs and if I‚Äôm out of subs (pills are expensive) about more than half my money will go to pills then.

949^Dank167^dreams^See what true mental things get you into addictive personality. Everyone has a crutch. I‚Äôm extremely anxious, ptsd. And was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago.

I‚Äôm only a 20 year old male.

So no, I say fuck ptsd medicine (dreams) and I say fuck ssris‚Äô (expensive for a chance of happiness I never got)

So here I am. I do benzos and switch which kind I take I never take Xanax, Valium, kpin, phenazepam, etc 2 days in a row and he‚Äôll if my days going good (I have a gf that brings me joy) I‚Äôll just leave it be.

Thing is there‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôre called ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù addicts. Wherever you decided to stop popping pills or doing h or f or scramble. You were most likely rock bottom. 

Use that crutch you find to get you out the mental hole and then everytime you REALLY feel a relapse coming on of a drug that destroyed your life. Use your crutch (weed, benzos, kratom, hell even Suboxone we can actually work and do everything we need to do in normal life I just choose to quit to actually have my own space and piece of mind

I knew I wasn‚Äôt suffering from chronic pain. I just switched from my Xanax script to my plugs norcos then perks then morphine and hydromorphone.  That whole time I wasn‚Äôt on my meds I need I need to be chilled I‚Äôm a hothead through childhood. (Don‚Äôt like if someone makes a joke about me I feel like I always have to stand up it‚Äôs the anxiety and ptsd working)

Now I‚Äôm on benzos. Yes some Friday and Saturday nights I turn in early cause I‚Äôm on schedule but it feels good to have control over sleep eating and work and money.

Trust me man I‚Äôve been off the everyday pills since end of November, suboxone till last week. And I‚Äôm here now battling lil things but happy you‚Äôll get there

949^Dank167^opiate^No I feel there‚Äôs a difference in going into a relationship with opiate addiction and going into a relationship clean then ending up using. Your thoughts and heart will play at you if you really love that person it‚Äôs why I wrote a rant

949^Dank167^opiates^A good doctor would put the fact of that weed causes paranoia into my lifestyle I barely can get by with it anymore on painkillers it was just another thing to bring a high. Now it‚Äôs like ew I don‚Äôt want a headache sometimes at night when I‚Äôm on my medicine I do a dab of weed shatter or wax for a good sleep. And if a doctor prescribes a chronic pain patient 120 vics 10s every month cause of pain from leg surgeries, his education is probably right. If a doctor wants me to have 60 Xanax 2s a month for my mental illness‚Äôs. Again, education, better, than, yours. 

I wasn‚Äôt me with out it and when I was first prescribed Xanax (my first benzo) this doctor did separate visits with psych talkers and therapy always there. Never forced it on me if anything told me consequently what could happen with addiction. 

Which is easier for me than opiates

949^Dank167^opiates^I‚Äôm back and forth from doing it. Only way out is suboxone in my opinion. Takes the withdrawals mostly away and after a week you can be full functioning on it. My advice take 8mg once a day for 3 days, then cut down to 6 for a week, 4, 2 etc. and then stop subs before you get addicted to those.

You can message me, I also tell people see a therapist or psych doctor. Dopamine (interest) is different for everyone some people don‚Äôt have as much as others. Same with serotonin (happiness). There‚Äôs benzos and ssris and even ptsd medication or just plain sleep medication.

But a doctor can ask you about your life and figure out why you need a crutch like h to get by (although just say you‚Äôre on opiates not heroin) 

I was figured out to be depressed, ptsd, and hypertension with anxiety so the manic version.

Ill admit I‚Äôm 20 year old male who was prolly raped while I was young by a blood brother of mine. So it makes sense why later in life I was confused with feelings and did drugs to ignore or face the fact that I‚Äôm one of those.

950^Moneyman3658^china^Never seen tar down here in the dirty south. We had a china white stint for about 2 or 3 years. Now it's dry down here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
951^TirelessGuerilla^china^there's actually a lot of the first cases that trace people that didn't go to the market and the believed to be patient zero didn't go to the market as well to be honest I'm leaning more towards the theory that it's from the lab. It's documented a chinese man who works in the Wuhan lab worked on and wrote a paper in an American University where they got a bat Corona virus to infect humans. That's a pretty big coincidence. look at the conspiracy subreddit for the documentation I'm too lazy to post it. Don't get me wrong it could definitely be that nasty ass market with it's bat soup, but I don't really believe in coincidences this big at the same time. Also as a bonus when China constructed the bio research lab to save face they did not get input from other countries on how to build such a lab and when it was being built people were worried that things would escape from it.

951^TirelessGuerilla^china^We won't know until it gets worse outside of China because China has a record of not reporting accurate numbers in times like these, remember SARS.

951^TirelessGuerilla^opium^Ok man, look, heroin becomes morphine in your body. Opium has morphine in it. What do you think?

951^TirelessGuerilla^black^As a tangent I would like it known that those companies are a complete fraud and people have sent the same genetic sample to multiple companies and each one gave them different results you literally cannot trust those companies anyways. skin color doesn't have to do with Africans are less evolved it's because people need to synthesize vitamin d and having white skin in Africa will get you killed from sun radiation and having black skin in Norway will get you killed from lack of vitamin d synthesis

951^TirelessGuerilla^opium^just taper with whatever you have then it's all morphine just do it until your not throwing up and then stop before your high. People smoke opium out of those long opium pipes but I assume chasing the dragon on foil would work too but idk I've never had it either man

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
952^pajamaman621^opiates^if you're drinking enough that you get the shakes (delirium tremens) or on benzos you should talk to a doctor before quitting, withdrawal from those two substances can be deadly and best done in the hospital. If you are addicted to opiates, you can detox at home, it's doable, but much harder. I'd suggest going to a doctor and detoxing in the hospital for that too...

&#x200B;

You're going to have to be honest with your spouse about all of this, and most importantly honest with yourself. Nobody else, in theory, needs to know. 

&#x200B;

Once you've detoxed, I'd highly suggest going to a rehab (inpatient depending on how severe your addiction is, but at the very least an outpatient one). In addition to that, you need to do AA/NA/CMA/CA, any of those, they're all the same basically. 

&#x200B;

If you really commit to doing all of this, you're going to be amazed at how great your life can become in a pretty short amount of time. They key is, you gotta do the deal, you can't half ass this stuff.

&#x200B;

Feel free to message me at any time, happy to help in any way I can.

953^Smokemctoke420^opiate^You must not be from the U.S. lol fent is short for fentanyl which is a really powerful opiate that‚Äôs easy to produce a lot of for cheap so people are cutting non opioids, like cocaine, with fent. People are also pressing 30mg oxys and whatever other pill they can with the shit and it‚Äôs killing people by the thousands. Shits crazy.

954^813phlebotomy^opiates^Depends who is working the work phone. Out of the three different runners two of them is always open by 8am sometimes 730. The third runner who works 4 days out of the week has no consistency.. He will come to my house at 830am rarely. Mostly 10am he is ready and rarely 11am.he got here at 1040am today. They have lifes to live too and I respect that, all I ask for is communication don't leave me ghost. 

A couple years ago I got from this guy who was a user also and I could stop by his place before i had to go to work some mornings early as 615am.   

Opiates is defiantly a morning game and if they want the sales they will run shop at the right time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
955^LiddleFace^opiate^Haha yeah I‚Äôm not saying I started smoking right after my opiate use I‚Äôve been smoking since 2004, I was saying after getting clean it‚Äôs not like I could just stop thc, it took 9 months after getting off opiates to stop the herb, and I was on opiates on and off since 2008.

955^LiddleFace^opiate^Not gonna lie I didn‚Äôt think I could ever stop smoking either , I smoked hash or herb every day for 9 months after my last opiate use and only because of a new job I stopped smoking 3 months ago. I wish I could still blaze but the anxiety kills me . I used to think I was more anxious without weed but it‚Äôs actually the opposite.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
956^AfterTod4y^opiate^Taking it easy today. I think I‚Äôm catching my poor kiddo‚Äôs cold/flu thing.  
Otherwise been holding up ok. IDK how many opiate- free days I have but it‚Äôs been a little over a year and I‚Äôm proud of myself for that! Take care everyone!

956^AfterTod4y^opiates^Doing ok. I‚Äôve been getting more cravings this month than I have in quite a while. I‚Äôm NOT going to throw away a year clean from opiates though! 
I‚Äôm considering checking out Smart Recovery. A friend of mine has been completely sober for a year because of it.  I haven‚Äôt done any sort of a program since quitting - it might help keep me off drugs and maybe help cravings? Maybe??
I don‚Äôt know why this month is so difficult. Probably because the winter/boredom. 

Hang in there everyone!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
957^soiledhoopskirt^opiates^Do you take Adderall or have done any type of upper prior to taking it? My ex was prescribed Adderall and would always say he didn't feel the percs we'd get. Once he stopped taking it that's when he was able to feel to opiates. I regret every single time I use anything speedy- I spend the rest of my night blowing through my dope trying to come down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
958^Wheeler559^black^When I was a kid 6-7, i was in the backyard helping (more like playing) while my Dad removed our old stinky above ground pool. Behind our backyard is an old 7up Bottling plant. It's basically a gigantic old warehouse covered in sheet metal panels with a huge over grown yard attached. The yard was basically just dry grass that reached your stomach and a few unkept over grown walnut trees here and there. 

  I'll remember this forever and just typing it is making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. While my dad was preoccupied with whatever he was doing, I was playing near the fence that the two lots are connected by. I don't remember why I looked, maybe I heard something, i dunno, but i definitely saw something. Peering through a knot hole, I could see what appeared to be a tall man, wearing a black jumpsuit standing underneath and in between some of the walnut trees. The over grown grass covered most of his legs, but i remember staring at him and him staring back at me.  He didn't move, he just stared. I remember backing away from the fence and then running for my Dad freaking tf out.  

  My dad gave me the same annoyed look like "what is it this time". He went over and looked over the fence but saw nothing. So i went back to the knot hole to see if he was still there. But instead of him standing there it was just trees and grass. I've got some crazy goosebumps right now just re-telling this story. I have no clue who or what it was, but its a memory that'll stick with me forever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
959^malachi347^opiates^Yup. That's how I got hooked. 6 years of rx'd percocets for a degenerative spine disease. Doctor left my med group and BAM - you're left with withdrawls and a brain programmed to require opiates. I really feel for chronic pain patients because I couldn't imagine living like that my whole life. I'm very glad for how things turned out because I finally found a way to control my pain that doesn't require my brain to check out.

959^malachi347^opiates^Burning man? Running around on a nudist colony? Going ham on the drums/an instrument? Traveling to dangerous/weird places (slab city!) Haha so many things can get me going...

If you could afford opiates you could afford extreme sports. Just a matter of saving up. You wouldn't be able to get "high" all the time, but life isn't about that. It's about looking forward to those times. "The journey is the destination."

Don't look at it as a hole, it's the "prep" space leading up to the best moments/memories of your life...

959^malachi347^opiate^I have found that it does prolong some of the symptoms - but it absolutely is a invaluable tool. Don't use more than 2-8mg for the first few days. You may find that once stopping you'll have some additional lethargy (which you will have anyways) and also the runs, but having a good diet and exercise will mostly solve that issue. In my experience, I just try to take the smallest amount possible until I'm down to 1mg a day. Immodium really is a powerful opiate - it just happens to not cross the blood-brain barrier very easily. Hope this helps!

959^malachi347^opiates^I really only see one solution here -

1. Tell your family he is trading the treatment drugs for illegal drugs (that is, if you know this for sure... in which case provide proof). They are enabling him and sending him to an early grave.
2. If he wants to continue MAT through that clinic, the family should be testing him themselves for other opiates before driving him to the clinic.
3. Set boundaries - if you catch him with a 30 or he has fent in his piss, cut him off.

959^malachi347^black^Looking forward to reading your post... and yeah, I noticed he was posting as well... you need to tell him "I can't help you if you're not going to be honest with me." There are literally a thousand different paths to recovery out there - and you can certainly help him with each one if you love him enough to stick it out with him - but if he continues to lie, just know that his use WILL come at a huge cost to you - mentally, physically, financially, emotionally. It's selfish of him - if he loves you he wouldn't lie to you. Hard truths, bud, sorry. That's pretty basic, black and white IMO. Honesty is the foundation of any genuine, loving relationship. It's what everything else is based on. Just be prepared, at some point in X years he may say "After trying a million ways to get clean, I've realized I don't really want to quit." At least then you can make an informed decision on how you want your future to look.

959^malachi347^opiate^These are alll crazy thoughts so take it with a grain of rice. I'm not a professional, lol... You'd throw the bag away the moment he got it. That's if he's just after the "rush" of picking up or wanting to "know it's there" (spoiler: that's bullshit). If his excuse is he needs "just needs one night sleep" - fine give him a point before bedtime and flush the rest. 

I'm not saying the boundary has to be "use even a tiny bit and I'm moving to Canada forever" - perhaps for your situation it can be "use behind my back again and I'll leave you until you can piss clean for a week". An ultimatum worked on me, but that's perhaps because my SO knows me so well. The thought of losing her was enough for me to suck it up and be a man and power through the pain. Plus I know she would have stuck by her word and left.

Also, you'll find opiate withdrawls are rarely life-threatening - especially if he's already at day 4. Sounds like he's just making excuses. Yes it's uncomfortable, and yes it's miserable, but you have to pay the piper after taking all that pleasure on credit.

960^zoodula^opiates^Hi- you may want to post this on r/opiates. This is a subreddit for people getting off and staying off of opiates.

960^zoodula^opiate^Hi You!  I know all about this.  My "old school" home group is staunchly for calling everything alcohol in AA. Singleness of purpose.  To the point that they have chased out a newcomer for introducing themselves as an addict.  With my usage history (alcohol, opiates and booze) I really struggled in the beginning because I was so sick from opiate withdrawal and it was my main addiction.  Talked to my sponsor and others in the program and decided that all of my addictions were the same disease and now feel comfortable lumping everything into alcoholism.  

That said, when I was the speaker at a meeting, I talked about my opiate addiction as it is part of my story. I respect the singleness of purpose and have found recovery in AA, but am honest about my history. I do introduce myself as an alcoholic though out of respect.

960^zoodula^opiates^Nice!! Good for you.  I'm feeling the same way. My desire to drink is gone through working the 12 steps (AA version- I think they are all the same?)  It's been 18 mo. since my last drink and I can't say when I lost my obsession with opiates and alcohol, but I feel free. That "triggered" feeling is gone. 

I live with a drinker and have booze in the house, so I haven't avoided it, but have no desire to pick up. Yay for us!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
961^thebenzpartyisover^opiates^My therapist once told me that opiates and benzodiazepines stunt our emotional growth. 

Maybe try not using them for a while and try to work through some of this shit you're going through. A year off really gave me some perspective.

962^Lat3ris^black^favorite song ; Lateralus

>It runs 9:22
Radio stations usually play a shortened version of the song that has a shortened intro and the quiet part after the solo taken out. 
 
Reasons


* All of the art work done on the album cover, the CD itself and even the background screen at the concert are the works of Mr. Alex Grey. He is an artist that attempts to capture what humans look like without their outside flesh. Many of his drawings are of human bodies that lack all exterior features such as hair, skin, nails, etc. Grey has found a way to not only draw humans in this state but has drawn their "energy" surrounding them and in them.



* The line "Black then white are all I see in my infancy, red and yellow then came to be" has to do the the Aborigines from Australia who at first did art work only with black and white paints then later discovered how to make red and yellow, which they incorporated in their art. The "Spiral" would probably be either the earth twisting on its axis or its rotation around the sun. 

*  The beginning lyrics of the song use the Fibonacci number sequence, where each number is the total of the two before it....


>Black (1)
then (1)
white are (2)
all I see (3)
in my infancy (5)
red and yellow then came to be (8)
reaching out to me (5)
lets me see' (3)

Their drummer is also known to use several other mathematical sequences in his playing. 

The saying 
>"as below, so above and beyond, I imagine"

 probably has to do with the principle of the saying "as above, so below" used by Neo-Pagans while opening the Magic Circle. 

According to an All-Tool issue of MERKIN magazine, this song was originally called "987" because it the time signature changes in a repeating sequence of 9/8, 4/4, then 7/8. Justin Chancellor(God himself), Tool's bassist, had this to say about the song: "For me, the song 'Lateralus' was the turning point. I wrote a bar of nine, a bar of eight, a bar of seven, and we originally called the song '987'. I saw it as something that kept getting shorter and shorter and, like a spiral, it kind of folds in on itself

Did I satisfy your inquiry?

Spiral out

963^totallyincorrigible^opiate^I unknowingly took a massive intravenous dose of some unnamed dissociative or hallucinogen. I do not like hallucinogens (I avoid weed and even THC makes me trip), I certainly had no intention of taking them and I was not prepared *at all*. It was possibly one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. Definitely the most intense sustained fear I have ever felt.

I used to be an IV heroin user in the Philadelphia area. The summer before last (so June 2018) there were a lot of anecdotal reports going around of some tainted dope working its way through the supply chain. I was happily all aboard the self-destruction express at that point and so I didn't really care. I typically would take the train into the city to cop and then fix up in the station bathroom before heading back out.

On this particular day, after I already bought my usual quantity from my usual corner I had a few extra bucks on me so I bought a few bags from another dude I'd never seen before so I wouldn't have to break the bundles I had. The stamp bags were pre-printed which is unusual in this area. Got to the station, went into the women's room and got out my works. I mixed up two bags of the second guy's dope - it seemed like a normal color and mixed up normally. Shot the two bags. It burned a tiny bit but nothing out of the usual.

After a few seconds I felt what seemed like a normal high coming on, but it was suddenly replaced by a very different "wave" that did not feel at all like an opiate. I started worrying that I'd taken too much and was about to fall out - I had already had two previous ODs. I blinked once and instantaneously - I mean literally it was like flipping a switch - I could not remember where I was, how I had gotten there or who I was supposed to be meeting. I could vaguely recall there was *someone* who was waiting for me (that would be my boyfriend) but I couldn't remember who they were, or their name, or my name for that matter. I began to get very scared at this point. I looked down at my hand and I was already getting intense visuals. My knees sort of gave out and I fell against the stall door and the wall. Somehow I had the wherewithal to yell *Can anybody hear me??* I vaguely recall hearing several women call back that yes they could hear me, and so with the last bit of conscious effort I possessed I literally screamed *CALL AN AMBULANCE* and with that I completely dissociated from my body and blacked out.

Of course I wasn't entirely blacked out because I was being bombarded by these intensely bright, chaotic fractals against a field of total darkness, like a spirograph or something. I should emphasize that I was completely 110% convinced I had overdosed and died, and that I was dead and that this was just what happens to us after we die. It was pretty logical really because, for one who really knows anyway, and two I had already nearly died twice from ODs, and I mean what *other* explanation could there have been? It's not like I had deliberately eaten a bunch of mushrooms. I somehow still knew that I had just shot a bunch of heroin and so I was terrified and acutely afraid that I would just go insane. There's a short story by Stephen King called "The Jaunt" where this futuristic technology allows people to teleport but they have to be asleep to survive it, and it turns out that if you go through while you're awake, the matter comprising your physical form goes through in a matter of seconds but your consciousness actually gets "stuck" somehow in this infinite timeless void and the person literally comes out insane and screaming at the other end. Welp, that's exactly what I thought was happening. I can't emphasize enough just how certain I was that I was dead. (Spoiler: turns out I am not dead.)

Ultimately I began to come out of the acute dissociative state after a few minutes (which felt like years) to the sound of several of Philly's finest crammed into the women's bathroom trying to figure out what to do with the panicked marble-eyed troglodyte I had become.

I was taken to the ER but never found out exactly what was in the stuff, but my best guess was something along the lines of MXE. I suspect a mixup with whatever Chinese online pharmacy was supplying the bulk fentanyl they cut the dope with. Something nearly identical happened a couple months later en masse, and something like 30 or 50 people ended up in the hospital with symptoms that were "atypical of opiate intoxication" like hallucinations, tachycardia and severe agitation. It was ostensibly blamed on K2.

965^psychobabbleX^dreams^I weighed myself at 3am this morning: 197.2

Then I weighed myself at 6am this morning: 198.8

That's why it is advised to do it 1x week, 1x month if you can. I like to watch the fluctuations, personally, so I do it daily. 

I just happened to wake up at 3am thinking it was 6am (weird dreams, let me tell you), so I weighed myself. Today was an anomaly.

965^psychobabbleX^dreams^Strange dreams are my favorite dreams. Well, all dreams are my favorite, I'm quite fascinated by them.

Once I dreamt of eating shrooms and actually felt the body buzz and started to see hallucinations in my dream. It was the night before my sister's wedding...not sure what the connection is, but I had not done mushrooms in many years prior to that nor was I planning on it anytime soon.

Potatoes are a miracle cure sent from God himself.

968^appleparkfive^black^That's apparently happening already, from articles I've read. 

I think he's slowly winning over the black community, which is very important. Biden had them because "Obama's VP". But that's it. Now a ton of very influential black figures are endorsing him, and it's huge.

968^appleparkfive^black^Nevada seems to be oddly overlooked lately. It's a real tight race, and with a lot of young people voting, often for the first time ever. A LOT of people from California and the major east coast cities have moved to Northern Nevada, due to the massive amount of businesses moving in there. Plus Reno is heavy into the arts, has a nice walkable area with people living in a mini version of an east coast city.

I believe their 2018 midterm turnout was massive too. Might be wrong. But I heard basically everyone came out, young and old. Voting lines were an hour or more, when they're typically like 20 minutes.

I think there's more progressive democrats there, as opposed to Iowa which seems to have more centrist democrats. I think Warren will definitely have a better turnout, and wouldn't be surprised if Bernie wins.

As for southern NV, basically Las Vegas, I think Buttigieg won't fair nearly as well. We all know he has a problem with people of color currently. There's a lot of black and Hispanic people in Vegas, not to mention Asians and other groups. If the Hispanic community goes for Sanders, it's going to be a definite win. Buttigieg might do well with the folksy Iowa crowd, but... Nevada is basically Las Vegas in the south, and Reno/Carson City in the north. A lot of empty space in between with tiny cities.

968^appleparkfive^black^ At the start of the race he got it for being Obama's VP. But as time has gone on, a lot of the influential black figures have endorsed Bernie. They see what he's saying is similar to MLK, even if people want to look past that part of MLK's rhetoric. MLK wasn't about equality for black people alone. It was for everyone. Regardless of race or circumstance.

Also there's a damn picture of Bernie being dragged away and arrested in the 1960s for protesting against segregation. That helps. Haha.

968^appleparkfive^black^Black people, as a community, are VERY good at pointing out a bullshitter, or a con man.

968^appleparkfive^black^"Pete, black people have dubbed you 'The Second Crack Epidemic", I hear on the streets. Why do you think that is?"

"Bernie, can you tell me about this picture of you as a baby sitting on Karl Marx's lap, and what it means to you? Oh wait, your time is up, I'm sorry"

"Klobuchar. You're a great American and economists state that you will hurl the stock market to new highs, like a stapler at an intern. What are your thoughts? 5 minutes, go ahead."

968^appleparkfive^china^I don't even see why people are downvoting statements like this.

Guys. Think...

The way China is acting is extremely ridiculous. Yes, our country has major issues too. But still. 

I feel like this sub, of all places, should comprehend the issues in China. Because its a lot like what we have, but amplified.

970^ShhActNatural^black^No, you are misrepresenting the difference. White assholes argue that black people are lazy and violent because they are assholes. Using a qualifier such as "black", "white", or "fat" are purely descriptive (adjectives) and not stereotypes until they are attached to stereotypical behaviors. No stereotypical behaviors or qualifiers were used, so you are simple upset that this person said fat people who were jealous of other fat people losing weight are assholes. So, do you disagree that people who are jealous of someone's dedication and sucess in losing weight the way they want to but who are unwilling to put forth the effort required to lose that weight but instead call that person terrible names are assholes? Are these name calling, jealous, unwilling to work for their goals in favor of putting down those that do people assholes?

970^ShhActNatural^black^You seem to be the only one confused on this. The qualifier 'fat' was used to describe the particular type of asshole specifically because the content of the comment required it. You know this because it was about fat people who got jealous and angry at someone who was able to do what they themselves were not. So it's not just any asshole, it's specifically fat assholes. The comment in no way suggested that all fat people are assholes or that all assholes are fat. The same type of comment could be said about a person lacking in intelligence and/or common sense being upset and jealous when someone who previously was ignorant chooses to educate themselves. They are dumb assholes who are jealous they haven't bettered themselves the way that person did. However, the same situation cannot be applied to race since it cannot be changed or improved upon in such a way that would make someone else a "black asshole".

972^LexBrew^black^I live how African Americans are always listed as one individual like they vote together. Here's my opinion, blacks as a group are poor and have a lot going on in their lives, poor people don't have the privilege of staying informed of every little political thing or where everyone stands. They have work and children to raise and thus bigger things to worry about than a bunch of rich white people arguing on stage, where most of what they say are lies. The other day, 3 of the smartest people in the country couldn't identity a picture of Adam Schiff on Jeopardy, most Americans are not clued in.

Sure Biden had more support right now, but only because of Obama, I guarantee most people who don't pay attention to politics cannot articulate a single difference between the 3 front runners. So, they support Biden because of name recognition and the media links Biden to a hero of the black community, Obama. Just like when Obama was elected, the narrative is he didn't have black support until he won Iowa, no, most black people didn't even know who Obama was until he won Iowa because his press coverage BLEW UP. 

My point at last, who cares about how much black support Biden has, support doesn't matter, getting people out to vote is what matters; and it's obvious that Biden is not going to get blacks out to vote like Obama did. So, while they are an important voting block,Obama win because he got a lot of blacks to the polls who normally could have cared less about politics. We have Trump because Americans are starting to realize that politicians are a ruling class of people who are all currupt. Many Bernie supporters something like 20% voted for Trump after he lost the primary. If Bernie wins the primary, a lit of Trump's support will disappear, peole are tired of the establishment. 

I was laughing at the anger over CNNs treatment of Bernie, like you people think a multinational company like CNN is going to support a populist who wants to overthrow the elites and brjng power back to the people. I'm sorry but, I'm 100% voting for Trump and a good economy before I vote for an establishment candidate like Biden and I guarantee most Americans agree.

972^LexBrew^black^Not to minimize black subjugation but you guys were hardly the first people that were enslaved via the bible, Christianity, and religion as a whole. Honestly, almost as long as there has been organized religion, it has been used to preach to subjugated people. I mean it's core principal; that this life is filled with misery and that ONLY by following the laws of those in charge will you get to paradise and that is where real life begins, has been used to control enslaved people since it's inception

972^LexBrew^black^Staged, the last thing his campaign wants is for people to realize that a lot of people still don't agree with being gay. Like do whatever you do but they don't agree an Especially black and people like Mexicans who are very religious. I mean I don't give a fuck who dude loves or fucks, but a lot of people do.

972^LexBrew^china^How about closing the borders and now allow any Chinese visa holders in for a set period of time. I mean it's lunar New year and a women was already caught going to France infected because she didn't want to spoil her vacation and bragged on social media. I know we can close them all the way and ships arrive with Chinese goods and workers daily but if China is going to create this issues they need to be quarantined. Eatjng fucking rats and snakes and wolf puppies, fuck China, your government needs to control everything but could care less about wild game that spreads diseases.

972^LexBrew^black^So, 2 studies said 12% and another said 6% but that coupled with those who just skipped the general definitely had an impact. Now with a great economy I imagine that this would play out the same this coming election. 

Either way, recent reports show Trump with 30% support in the Black Community. I know the study is contested but the point remains, most people judge a president on the economy because like I said earlier, people recognize that regardless of the party in power little actually changes for the average American. Over the last 60 years, each party has held enough power to do as they wish and little has changed. 

People see Bernie as an outsider and rightly so, he doesn't belong in the Democratic party. Now as much as I would live to see the reforms he is promoting, Congress is still controlled by the elites and like the Republicans with Obamacare, it's easy to posture and declare that you are going to do something when you have no power to do so, but when it comes to actually voting to eliminate billions in debt or getting rid of a trillion dollars healthcare industry, I guarantee they will not vote against the interest of their donors.

972^LexBrew^opiates^As someone who lost everything to H, yeah legalize it a but there is not demand for Fent, dealers are using it because it's made in a lab, not grown and susceptible to downturns. The buzz sucks, a microgram gets you a ok buzz, 2 and you instantly go unconscious for an hour, 3 and your dead, no fun. If it's all legal, Luke everything should be, it would be tested for purity and everyone would be back to better dinner synthetic opiates or real H.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
973^ElixerElla^opioid^In responding to your post and some of your comments, a suboxone taper plan could save you. My input as someone who has been on suboxone MAT, used it to taper from heroin MANY TIMES, and done as much research as a person could do-- I agree with a commenter above who said to try to taper before giving in completely to a MAT program. Suboxone usually comes in 2mg or 8mg. If they are 8mg, get between 8-10 pills for a 12-14 day taper. When you start dosing it, start with 2mg and dose another 2mg every 4 hours up to 8mg, there shouldn't be any reason to take more than 8mg because of the ceiling. I (and doctors in treatment centers) recommend 8mg split in four 2mg doses for the first four days. Days 5,6,7 jump down to 6mg in three 2mg doses. Days 8,9,10 jump down to two doses (wake up and bedtime) of 2mg. Days 11 and 12 you'll take 2mg just at bedtime (helps with restless legs in the final stretch). You can even do 1mg for days 13 and 14, for the final doses. Don't take it longer than two weeks. The length/ higher dose you take, the stronger it will attach to your opioid receptors, meaning the longer/more painful the withdrawal will be. You will still face minor WD symptoms, but it should be off and on chills, sweats, RLS, and stomach upset. Nothing unbearable. You've got this! Take my advice. This method works.

977^lzbumblebee^dreams^First off, THANK YOU for introducing us (myself) to this lesswrong community‚ÄîI found it incredibly fascinating and wholly aligned with my own journey of creating new foundational beliefs, systems, and rituals for myself‚Äîperhaps this plays a bit into divination and the timely randomness of happenstance.

To speak more directly to this essay and your post in general, reading through the essay itself and some of the comments, I noted how it was elaborated on how divination and I suppose mysticism and ritual as a whole, were communal activities‚Äîa system that essentially encapsulated the superstition of man and the need for a more streamlined and ordered society. Is mysticism real? Is there merit in a belief in ‚Äúspirit‚Äù or a higher power or ‚Äúdivine‚Äù, cosmic plan. An ultimate Ultimate as a favorite writer of mine once said. Is intuitive belief or knowing a ‚Äúthing‚Äù? And how does one who calls themselves a skeptic or agnostic in belief, or secular as the name of this sub implies, come to terms with their use of such traditional divination tools like tarot, despite saying it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúmeditative‚Äù tool.

I don‚Äôt know if I wholly believe in the randomness of tarot as noted in the essay‚Äîcomments below it mentioned probability and needing to make sure that your own core and system of beliefs and philosophy aligned with whatever divination system you were utilizing. But I have found myself wading between the waters that tarot awakens a suppressed subconscious through its universal imagery and pictorial representation   and that maybe ‚Äúmore‚Äù is actually at play. Whether I believe that‚Äôs a greater power, I‚Äôm less inclined to believe. But perhaps there is a collective consciousness, a biological down to the shared DNA, means of connection that evokes a similar call and response in each of us. I say that as someone who is a practicing psychonaut, a creative, and someone who strongly believes in community and the necessity of returning to and creating rituals (for mourning, for moving forward, for celebration, etc), to get us back to a more grounded and authentic way of existing and being.

For myself, personally, I have been using tarot as a meditative tool, but I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt get a spooky ‚Äúwoo‚Äù, there‚Äôs more at play behind the scenes, feeling, when certain cards jump out and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù to me or my current situations. It feels too uncanny to be dismissive about. Some thing that something, wants me to pay close attention to or re-engage a reassurance of belief in‚Äîbut again, is this my own subconscious projecting itself, or more. And does it really matter?

I was going to make a post about it (and still may) about how sometimes tarot cards and their images will come, randomly and without prompting, into dream. I had one such occasion and it is either buried subconscious knowledge, or that more I was speaking of‚Äîbut ultimately, it doesn‚Äôt matter. The tarot dreams gave me a hope and a shift in perspective I would have never had. Maybe sometimes it‚Äôs best not to so much question the alleged source, but instead, take the message.

978^993username^opiate^I've taken opioids and drank multiple times and I really don't see the point of it. It's just super risky and usually the alcohol just overpowers the opiate so I'd rather just take one or the other. But if you still wanna (like for the social aspect of drinking with the boys) then having a beer should be fine, boy it's a slippery slope

&#x200B;

[this](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9bdymy/hamiltons-pharmacopeia-804-v16n4) is most likely the exact article you read

980^dontyouwannagodown^opiate^hey duder this is a normal part of the process.  your brain hates you right now and its pulling out all stops.  dont give up, you can get out.  don't rule out maintenance like subs or methadone.. i did methadone and havent done another opiate since 2014, stopped the methadone in jul of 2017 and i was hardcore.. you can do it

980^dontyouwannagodown^opiates^I don't want my comment to sound shitty so first I'll say its good that you are open to the help offered by your bro..  but, man, kicking opiates and not smoking weed are two different beasts.  You should definitely quit, and its good that he is pushing you to.. i just hate the 'tit for tat' quitting mentality and i had to comment.  good luck man, its better au natural for sure

980^dontyouwannagodown^opiates^tbh i'm not sure how good it was before, but definitely feel ya on this-  feels so awkward too.  i know people think i'm strange,esp at work, because i'm content not socializing and don't complain about my job.  how could i complain about it?  ive been in withdrawal in jail with no money to my name.  this is a walk in the park!  not an active addict, but i still feel like abusing opiates had something to do with it.  on the other hand, i feel like it made my long-term bonds even stronger than they were.  i fiercely care for them and i'm content w that

984^keepforgettingname6^opiates^Subs withdrawals last a pretty long time like methadone don‚Äôt they? So The worst probably lasts for quite a while compared to a few days with short acting opiates?

984^keepforgettingname6^opiates^Just nausea. But Iv never experienced it like this from other opiates, apart from maybe h time to time if it was quite strong

We are working on my dose at the moment. As Iv jumped over from bupe (where‚Äôd I‚Äôd worked myself down to 4mg a day) but I was still using from time to time on top of that, so it didn‚Äôt help

I‚Äôm just hoping this is the way forward to keep me off h for good. Didn‚Äôt expect to be feeling this shitty and sick though üòÇ it‚Äôs almost like withdrawals, but like I said the oxy didn‚Äôt help to make it go away, which I thought it may have if it was w/d‚Äôs

985^sketchburger^chocolate^Went from a high carb low fat vegan diet (I wasn‚Äôt militant about it and would eat animal food if someone made it for me) but was really sticking to like 80/10/10 or sometimes 90/5/5 macros and eating tonnnnns of fruit and rice Durianrider style. I was already thin when I started doing this, it was for ethical reasons and as a sort of body composition experiment (I am a graduate student of nutrition and take great interest in this). 

I started running a lot and was getting injured and fatigued so started adding in a lot more protein and fat, first beans and peanut butter, then eventually eggs which made me feel like 100% times better and full for hours which I hadn‚Äôt  felt in months eating the hclf vegan way. 

I transitioned  over a couple of months to a very high fat and protein low carb mostly meat and egg and some cheese diet with a few veggies wine and dark chocolate  (I‚Äôve done it before with good results) which is how I‚Äôm eating now with even lower body fat but a little less in the way of the fitness I built up.  I try to be conscientious of the kind of meat I consume in regard to animal welfare depending on my budget.

Sorry for long winded answer and that this may seem extreme but because of my experience and knowledge of human metabolism, I know I that a person can only stay lean without calorie restriction by eating mostly  carbs OR fat, not both. So keep that in mind when switching diets if body comp is important to you.

Low fat high carb will result in great fitness performance for endurance sports. Keto/carnivore will not at first but I‚Äôm hoping to adapt and get back where I was fitness wise. In my experience, I feel so much better between meals on an animal based diet too, like I won‚Äôt die of reactive hypoglycemia if I don‚Äôt keep a bag of dried fruit with me at all times. Also skin is less dry and teeth less sensitive. Most vegan diets are not sustainable long term.

985^sketchburger^chocolate^F/31/5‚Äô6 CW116 (down from around 123 before this round of Keto-not intentionally but fine with it)
I eat around 2,000 cals per day currently about 55% fat/25-30 protein/5-10 carbs. I prefer higher protein because the satiation factor and am interested in building lean muscle, so I‚Äôd say amino acids a are not an issue. 

I eat mostly animal foods right now, lots of egg yolks beef chicken pork lamb and fish. Some cheese, a bit of veg and dark chocolate and wine. Phased out whole grains first then most fruit and have been strictly Keto for about a month or two now. I have always been salt sensitive but have been embracing it more lately and adding more to my food. 

Truthfully I‚Äôm not even sure if my drop in performance is due to diet or much less training though I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs all interrelated. When I was running on carbs and eating literally whole boxes of pasta in one sitting or 5 banana smoothies, I felt more compelled to burn them off because I‚Äôve had issues with my blood sugar before, now I feel more calm and less hungry all the time but also less motivated to do endurance sports. I miss the sweat factor and want to race again this Spring.

Thanks.

986^atetoomany^opiates^I hope you have narcan as pink is very dangerous. I would put s tiny amount of powder on my finger tip and just taste it and see how that effects you. If you are very experienced with very strong opiates then proceed from there as desired. Please be careful

986^atetoomany^chocolate^Eat them with something like chocolate. Get like 5 Hershey bars melt them in a pot over low heat stirring a lot to make sure it doesn't boil. Dice the shrooms and way out an even amount to put into each mold. Pour in the chocolate add the amount of shrooms you want and wait to cool and harden. Enjoy

987^CosmicCatDaddy^opiates^I agree, but I‚Äôm not that person so can‚Äôt say how they feel. I unfortunately abused opiates at a young age and got on methadone for five years at the age of 20-21 can‚Äôt recall. For me, being happy is having a job to look forward to/pays well/room for growth and have things to look forward to after work.. whatever that may be. Even being clean, but isolating ones self from the world put me in a very bad place mentally and physically.

991^FreddyLynn345_^opiate^Honestly I think any opiate zaps the humor right out of you. 

The last time I was super dope sick I told my mom to stop talking to me because she was making me laugh so much that it was physically uncomfortable. I think it felt weird because I hadn't used whatever muscles you use to laugh in years

991^FreddyLynn345_^opiates^I kinda thought that it was actually a symptom of very mild withdrawal. When I quit using fent on top of my methadone I felt lethargic and heavy... kinda how I feel in withdrawal but just like 5% as intense. I think maybe I felt like that cause my brain was just adjusting to having less opiates in my system

992^PurpleElee^opiates^Lol sorry I didn‚Äôt compliment it like everyone else who commented did, just telling the truth. Apparently true enough for me to be the only comment you replied to. I think you‚Äôre forgetting that a subreddit dedicated to opiates has a higher tolerance for bad content relating to it. See if /r/comics like this as much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
993^Where_You_Want_To_Be^black^> Unless the argument is that black people by default subscribe to the apathetic, lazy, uncouth "culture".

The argument is more complex than that, and trying to put that argument in someone else‚Äôs mouth is disingenuous. 

Thomas Sowell (a black, highly regarded economist) has written extensively on this.  The explosion of the welfare state in the 1960s reversed so much of the forward progress being made by the black community.  Single motherhood rates, Murder rates, violent crime, all were much lower rates before the 1960s. 

So, the argument isn‚Äôt that black culture is inherently bad, the argument is that black ‚Äúculture‚Äù has been damaged by govt ‚Äúfixes‚Äù. 

The 1950s and 1960s were undoubtedly more racist than today, yet by almost every metric, the African American community was fairing better at the time than they are now. What changed?



https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2015/05/poor_blacks_looking_for_someon.html

Sowell also notes that: ‚ÄúSuch trends are not unique to blacks, nor even to the United States.

The welfare state has led to remarkably similar trends among the white underclass in England over the same period.‚Äù

993^Where_You_Want_To_Be^black^> Most of the kids have parent support as far as working hard and aiming for college, so the whole "black culture is the reason" argument doesn't hold water.

That‚Äôs kind of a small sample size isn‚Äôt it?

993^Where_You_Want_To_Be^black^> . Black people are still far more likely to be given harsher punishments than white cohorts who commit similar crimes.

I have never seen one of these studies that accounts for prior convictions and/or parole/probation status.  Also, many of them don‚Äôt account for additional charges or circumstances. 

A person who is arrested for a bag of coke on their first arrest is going to get less time than a person who is arrested with a bag of coke while out on parole with two prior drug possession convictions, while carrying a gun. 

Sentencing is crazy complicated and I‚Äôve yet to find a study that does anything other than just look at the crimes committed and the sentence given. 

> and increased segregation in education, and your question is largely answered.

See page 12, schools have been becoming less segregated in the last 10 years.

To your other points, those may have an effect, but I don‚Äôt think they negate other causes I‚Äôve been discussing.

994^PM_ME_PCP^opiates^If that‚Äôs the case do not try opiates, they will fill the void like nothing else trust me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
995^saintnicklaus90^opioid^I‚Äôve always been attracted to extremes. When I was really young this manifested itself in me holding my pee until it was unbearable just to feel the relief of emptying my bladder. I would also not drink any water for extended periods of time just so I could get the ultra satisfaction of gulping down water while severely parched. As soon as I started experiencing opioid withdrawals and the feeling of relief and warmth after using, that became my addiction. I would remain hooked, experiencing the cycle of pain and relief for years and years. Predictably, I spent every cent I had and many cents I didn‚Äôt chasing those extremes until it became so unbearable I had to get professional help. 

Most people actively try to avoid pain. I was seeking it just to feel the rush of snuffing it out. I am grateful for my experience though as it taught me so much about myself. I‚Äôve abandoned my masochistic tendencies and treat myself with the love and care I deserve now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
996^iHateNewYork666^black^Around 5 years ago I made a delivery to an old man who had to be around at least 80 years  old. He came to the door wearing a black strap-on dildo. What made it even stranger was the way that he acted like it wasn't even there...  I seriously have no idea if he knew he still had it on or if he just didn't give a shit...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
997^falafelwaffle55^opiates^This may be a weird thing to hear, but as someone who used opiates in high school and college, I was glad when I realized it was only high school midterms you were talking about. It‚Äôs worse to be using at a young age, but when I think about how much money was lost and look at the debt I‚Äôm in for fucking up college because of drugs? It makes me hate myself 10x more. I was able to go back and retake the high school classes I failed for free. So I will tell you that if you‚Äôre able to one day beat this and get clean, this can be fixed. Do NOT stress about losing your chance to have a life. I often think about people who started much older than us who end up tens of thousands of dollars in debt because they were established in life, had access to crazy high credit limits, and good paying jobs. They also usually lose their wife/husband and children. The higher you are, the harder you fall I guess. But at the risk of sounding like my mom, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still young, there is plenty of time to come back from this‚Äù

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
998^Admiral_Sanu^opiate^I got Hydros for my wisdom teeth in high school. It was the first time I tried an opiate, and I decided immediately that I wanted to do opiates as much as possible from that point forward. I‚Äôm not saying this is a common outcome for people not predisposed to addiction, but it definitely happens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
999^daz3d-n-c0nfus3d^opiates^Sounds like your doing the best thing for yourself right now. Better to stick it out, then do what you want once your halfway house shit is over with.

I was clean for four years and relapsed a few months ago. I've chipped a few times since then. I honestly thought about dope all the fuckin time. Ive been using for a while too (8 years or so, before I got clean). Ive been addicted to cocaine too, but there's something about opiates and the fucking needle that draw me in.  When I was on methadone though, I didn't crave as much. 

Goodluck with having to be a ninja with your subs, kinda sucks but know ur doin what you gotta do and this shit will pass. At least ur not in jail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1000^throwaway8373789782^opiate^You‚Äôre on a drug sub, stop hating on people‚Äôs drugs. All drugs are welcome you bigot.

Also have you ever had ecp before? I‚Äôve only had ecp, but thinking about picking up some black. I have no opiate tolerance anymore, so I don‚Äôt want to shoot it, just smoke it. How long does smoking it last?

1000^throwaway8373789782^opiates^I mean if your are already addicted to opiates, and where given 120 for free a month, in the long run it would be more beneficial Becuase 120 a month for a year is 1440 pills a year and if you multiply that by the street price per pill it would be worth 43,200 dollars. 

It a way better deal getting the pills for free even if you don‚Äôt use them. You can sell them for a fuck ton. The only thing a car will do is depreciate in value and cost money to do repairs and gas

1000^throwaway8373789782^opiates^For real man, Kratom mental  wd Is just as bad or worse than normal opiates in my case. And yeah it‚Äôs a stupid cycle of being addicted and with drawing from Kratom. I‚Äôve wd and got addicted to Kratom 5 times at this point, it‚Äôs so stupid. 

I hope you get off it for good, thankfully I don‚Äôt have chronic pain so I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it is for you to get off it. Wish you the best man.

1000^throwaway8373789782^opiates^You ever tempted to steal any opiates. Not going to lie, I would be thinking about it every time I see them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1001^sixxdegrees^opiates^My experience with suboxone is that yes i am still physically dependant on it to not go through withdrawals, I also don't have cravings for opiates anymore. I get my pills from the pharmacy every week, no more lying, stealing etc. Yes it sucks being dependant on a pill to feel normal still. But i tried to stop using for two years before finally giving in to Suboxone and it's changed my life. I don't even think about getting high anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1002^queen0fpain^opiates^Yeah same too bb BUT I've been abusing opiates for 15yrs so as much as I wanna be off 'done, I'm stable but most importantly happy on 'done. Starting a tiny taper soon to get adjusted to a lower dose now that cravings aren't so bad. 

Fent is a damn serious thing, I'm super proud of YOU for booting it straight away after starting MMT! I wish I could say that too, it took me about 3 months to lose the desire to use. It wasn't hard for me to eventually lose the desire to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1003^Psydefects^opiates^Could very well be.. I used to say and do way worse..

Edit: I have yet to meet someone who had to use h to falsify the UA with a positive for opiates.. People end up in methadone clinics after years of active use..

1003^Psydefects^opiate^I remember there was a time, more than a few years back, when dried poppies and floral arrangements were the trend.. That's the closest you can get to an opiate high,literally speaking..

1003^Psydefects^opioid^The trend of the day is to greatly reduce opioid prescriptions because there is an ongoing "opioid crisis", I'm fairly sure you will have an equally hard time going the PM way..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1004^OpiatedMinds^opioid^Definitely go with the methadone. Suboxone won't really get you any sort of high, it isn't even a full agonist. With methadone its a full agonist, it's actually a great long lasting high but like anything else you will get a tolerance to it. Unlike suboxone you can keep increasing your dose up until a point (some people are on huge doses), and you may enjoy it to some extent but just be aware that you will be on it all the time, your system will be saturated, and you won't really get much of a high from it like you are imagining. More like you will be mildly high all of the time. If you've ever been on a really long oxy binge to where you take some and hardly feel it because you already have so much in your system, it will be kinda like that.

It will also be a nightmare if you ever decide you want to get off of it. They want you on a really high dose so you don't get any cravings, and also it destroys your tolerance so you won't even bother seeking out heroin or fent or oxy because it won't even do anything for you and will be a complete waste of money. 


So yeah I would go with the methadone, but it won't be like you think. In the beginning you might get right off of it and love it, but eventually you will likely come to regret it, they call it liquid handcuffs for a reason. I've never been on MAT, and I've thought along the lines you're thinking, but I realize my addiction isn't so severe I can cold turkey or maintain on kratom, and just get high on some opioid from time to time.So I can still have that escape and release and enjoyment, but just exercise some control over it.

1004^OpiatedMinds^dreams^Like someone else said, it is extremely mentally addicting. I've taken breaks before trying to quit, and it's crazy. I like to listen to music when I shoot or smoke it, and hearing a song I used to listen to during that rush would give me that anxiety and sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I would have dreams where I would have a ton of shit but for whatever reason I couldn't get off, it seems to be a rule that in using dreams you can't get high. It's frustrating, just telling you through dreams that you are still wanting it. 

It's not a physical addiction at all, it's a pure mental craving that manifests with physical symptoms like the anxiety that you described. You aren't physically addicted though don't worry. It will go away though don't worry man, I feel like it probably took me 6 months to a year, eventually it got to the point that I would laugh about the thought of using, I realized how crazy it was and had no desire to use at all. Then I ended up getting some coke one day and decided to try shooting it, and now I'm stuck back in that trap.

Just stay clean, try not to dwell on it, and the craving and the physical manifestations of the mental craving will eventually be gone. You just got to put time between yourself and it, and it will get more and more manageable to where you can think about it and instead of dwelling on the rush you can think about the comedown and the money wasted and all of the negatives and laugh the idea away. You'll get there if you want to stay clean don't worry it won't haunt you forever.

1004^OpiatedMinds^opiates^Opiates and freebase go together perfectly. Freebase by itself can make people horribly fiendish and willing to steal and do horrible things for another hit. They (opiates and cocaine) both have positives and negatives. Opiates have no nasty comedown and not as mentally addicting, but there is the physical addiction. Cocaine (especially smoked or injected) has a much stronger psychological pull, but it doesn't have that physical addiction and once the comedown fades it's not so bad.

The key is moderation, for both. And when used together, they balance beautifully, yin and yang. The cocaine spices up the dope and mitigates some of the respiratory depression (danger though, the cocaine wears off quicker which can cause the opioid to kick back in to dangerous levels when it wears off). And the opioid just about entirely eliminates the cocaine comedown and makes it fiend-free.

So I must say they are both bad in their own rights, and good in their own rights, it just depends on the care and self-control of the person using.

1005^kilpinger2^dreams^I'll post it but I'm not smoking weed or I'll fail my piss test for probation and then my suit case dreams are dead. #prioritize

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1006^Uncle_Screw_Tape^opiate^Like others have stated here, it really depends on the opiate you‚Äôre coming off of. 
With real oxycodone, 18-24 hours after your last dose will be sufficient to induct the subs. 
With real heroin, 24 hours+ after your last dose should be enough time. 
With fent or fentadope, it‚Äôs so different depending on the analogue that‚Äôs in it. I‚Äôve been fine taking a sub after 36 hours. But I‚Äôve also gone into PWD after like 55 hours after my last dose of dope. So it‚Äôs a lot more of a gamble. With fent, Start with small doses (.5mg-1mg sub) and increase from there every hour depending on how you feel. 
Hope this helps.

1007^WorthlessDrugAbuser^chocolate^Not unusual for delivery drivers to be friendly with neighborhood pets. As a UPS driver I keep dog treats with me. There are about a dozen dogs on my route that know the sound of my big brown truck (package car), they come running out of nowhere when I turn on to their block. 

There‚Äôs this one chocolate lab that will run up into the cab of my truck if I have the door open when I pull up. On days when there are no deliveries on his owner‚Äôs block he will desperately come looking for me when the sound of my truck can be heard a street or two away. Had to give the dummy a ride home one day because he took off and found my truck a few blocks away. From then on I always made sure I drove by his house to give him a treat, even on days I don‚Äôt have deliveries there.

Also, if you ever have a pet get lost or run away you should talk to your local UPS, FedEx, DHL guy. Show them a picture so they can keep an eye out. I‚Äôm not saying we are going to actively look for your pet but we are all over your neighborhood and might see them by chance. Last year I saw ‚Äòlost cat‚Äô fliers all over my route, I knew right away I had seen it a day before. Sure enough I drove to the area and the cat was hiding exactly where I saw it the day before. I was able to sneak up on it and snatch him, then called the owner and ended up driving it to them. That was by far my favorite delivery.

1007^WorthlessDrugAbuser^china^They‚Äôre filthy and disgusting people. I‚Äôm not being racist either, many other Asian cultures are clean and respectful, like [South] Koreans and Japanese. China is just a shithole. Source: I‚Äôve been to China, South Korea and Japan.

1007^WorthlessDrugAbuser^china^China is a cess pool. One giant steamy dumpster filled with maggots and exploded baby diapers.

1007^WorthlessDrugAbuser^china^Yup. Been to China a couple times. I‚Äôd rather live in a fucking dumpster in the USA than any city in China.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1008^Beatnholler^black^White is the absence of color and black is all colors absorbed, but when it comes to a actual light, white light has all colors in it (think of the Pink Floyd triangle and rainbow logo, that's literally how white light breaks down) so it could be that white light is the way that energy is reflected and that black is a void. You often hear people talking about black spirits looking blacker than black, this may be because they are literally a light void. It also may just be the only way our brains can process the spirit within the visible spectrum, bearing in mind that we can only see a tiny fraction of the light spectrum and they likely exist in many parts that we can't observe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1009^unholymole1^opiates^I felt that way at 1st. I personally think it's mindset in a lot of ways. I missed the euphoria of opiates, once I'd been on them awhile I became more active. That's a huge help. Slowly I started feeling less sorry for myself. Getting used to living instead of just existing. This may just have been my personal experience, but it seems to be fairly common. Good luck

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1010^cantremembermyface^opiates^Yesss same. Pm if you need to vent. I am clean 1 yr off opiates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1011^dexmonic^black^Look, being white person who works and votes doesn't make you a racist anymore than being black makes you lazy. The double standard is really quite ridiculous.

It's totally possibly to critique white racists without throwing an entire group of people under the buss. I'm a constant critic of racism in my area, north Idaho, which has a reputation for being racist.

But even coming from an area like this, I know what too many white people who work and vote that think like I do to say we're all racist because of the color of our skin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1012^winniedom^opiate^this is exactly how i became an opiate addict lol. i would suggest talking to your doctor - you don‚Äôt have to say it was your mom, but it will be a lot easier to get help now rather than down the road, if you are susceptible to addiction. good luck!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1013^johnnyc636^opium^Dude I have looked and I think I bookmarked a few sites. I know growing and extracting is a lot of effort when you can buy .3 for 20 quid but it's not like no cop is gonna notice poppy growing. 

I hear that a lot of the sold seeds are or were genetically changed to not produce opium latex. Like Amazon has bags on P. for sale but I would hate to grow it just to find there is nothing worth extracting in them.

1014^handstands_anywhere^black^I rode my warden down TOTW but I still would have rather had a DH. ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù when 100,000 people ride the park in a season = black. 
Also I would do TOTW first. It‚Äôs not the same as the rest of the park, and honestly a top to bottom run is LONG. I thought I would want to do a lot more laps than I ended up doing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1015^SnakeBitesApe^opiate^Iboga (ibogain), yes. I‚Äôve read a lot about it being amazing for opiate addiction. I am a 20-year opiate addict (clean since 2015) and mushrooms and DMT were life changing as it comes to my dealing with the actual reasons I became an addict to begin with, which completely changed the way I view and feel cravings. 

They‚Äôre not for everybody but maybe do a little googling before you make up your mind. 

Either way, don‚Äôt take any of the addictive shit in your collection! 

What‚Äôs your most ‚Äúexotic‚Äù drug?

1015^SnakeBitesApe^opiates^My problem was opiates and I‚Äôve been clean of those since 2015. I smoke weed and occasionally-but-regularly use shrooms. I‚Äôm treating with plants üå± and mushrooms üçÑ the thing I was previously using opiates to treat (mental problems).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1016^Ampleforth84^opiate^I feel the same way about everything you said (including being a Suboxone poster child-a Dr. at treatment used it rarely for all the opiate addicts but did keep me on a small dose.) And yes, reading some of these comments has me feeling a bit shitty so when you say ‚Äúthey look down on people,‚Äù I feel less shitty cause I realize it‚Äôs not just me. They are very defensive of anyone criticizing AA, even if it‚Äôs not in a disparaging way, but it‚Äôs like I insulted them purposely or personally. Which is the quality I mean when I say it has ‚Äúcult-ey vibes,‚Äù that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1017^NoseyCo-WorkersSuck^opiates^I think with a slow enough change over a long enough time, humans are capable of putting up with some seriously horrible shit... but I'm not sure back pain is one of them.  That issue you just never acclimate to.

I've been clean from heroin almost 4 years and almost 6 months from MMT.  I do stretches and yoga, I ran for a while until my knees couldnt take it, I've worked hard to reduce my anger and appreciate the little things in life... it has not gone away.  

I'm fortunate enough to live where pot is medicinal/legal and I bought some capsules because i figured it was better than opiates and i only took them in the evenings... just a few hours of peace per night.  I'm also not going to stop myself from having a drink or 2 to relax.  It's not like it makes me proud, but I also am trying not to be ashamed of myself for wanting even just a little bit of peace in my day.  What else am I supposed to do or try? Having an escape at night has improved my mood throughout the day immensely.

1017^NoseyCo-WorkersSuck^black^All black is nice too but i guess it's just different strokes for different folks, because i really like the look of the machines face with black on the inside.  Lincoln is straight up killing it with their wheels recently on the Navigator and Aviator, in my opinion at least.  I'm a fan of the premiums on the ST as well.

1017^NoseyCo-WorkersSuck^black^I love owl and cats pupils when they get all big.  It's like a black hole.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1023^KingNothing619^opiates^But it certainly does make you high.. it's only when you take it everyday & develop a tolerance, mixed with it's unique "cap effectiveness" that it doesn't make you high. If someone only takes it once a week they'll get super high. If they make it over the counter they'll be literally selling opiates next to the Advil.

1023^KingNothing619^black^Yeahh the rubber is in there good. I've noticed the leaking comes from underneath the black cap, as the sides get wet. Damn

1023^KingNothing619^opiates^Tapers are tough man. I bet only 1% of us can actually do a successful taper off opiates. The rest of us would choose to take enough to get us high , then suffer the WDs haha. So don't feel guilty, it happens

1023^KingNothing619^opiate^Damn using suboxone to get off Kratom huh. That's tough. I had a 40gpd Kratom habit, and just quit cold turkey. Felt super shitty but by day 5 I was good to go. I think using subs for a Kratom addiction is way overkill & counterproductive. Suboxone isn't a magic pill to skip the withdraw entirely. Anyway good that you didn't use subs for a long time, however, I don't think you'll get off scott free. You're still using an opiate, one with a much longer half life, that tends to just drag out the withdraw, although a milder version of it. I wouldn't be surprised if you felt shitty for a week. Yeah 5HTP will help.

1023^KingNothing619^opiate^Dang 4mg without an opiate tolerance, that's a lot. Did you feel sick or just felt good? Honestly it could be around 36 hours until it calms down, as the half-life of subs can be that long

1023^KingNothing619^black^Yeah people tell me it's from the condensation from under the cap. There's a video on YouTube, apparently removing the black cap is the solution

1023^KingNothing619^china^Yeahhh I rotate between 3 pods. When I leave the pod on the counter overnight and come to swap it, there's always a few drops under it. I use 50mg salt nic. Cracking is weird I've never seen that. Maybe they're bunk pods from China or someshit

1023^KingNothing619^black^Yeah mine are all 50mg nic salt. I notice it comes from under the black mouthpiece, not the rubber part. It's only the size of a dime but still. Now It's always on a napkin.

1023^KingNothing619^black^Yeah mine too. I noticed it comes from the black top area - not the rubber. Shit sucks

1023^KingNothing619^black^Yeah I notice the leaking comes from under the black cap, as the sides get wet. Not the rubber thing . Damn

1023^KingNothing619^opiate^I don't think those scars are opiate related. If you don't workout everyday, or eat processed foods, that would explain it

1023^KingNothing619^opiates^You're right I should have been more clear. I was referencing people who use it to get off opiates and rebuild their lives.

1024^Nintendodude71^opioid^You‚Äôre posting this for a bunch of tough talking spergs who know nothing of opioid addiction. Take this to r/opiates instead. Posting this here is a waste of time. These people are literally invested in a bunch of hipster podcasters social and sex lives

1024^Nintendodude71^opiates^He‚Äôs a legend for being a fucking lolcow, sure. Meth is a nasty ass fuckin drug, if I‚Äôm going to dope it‚Äôs going to be opiates

I don't know what I'm going to do because even when I use the Suboxone it doesn't take away my back pain. But I'd rather be in pain with a sore back then in withdrawal not being able to work. it's just so lame that I can't get the care that I need because these doctors are afraid to prescribe opiates which is really the only thing that takes away my back pain. Like I don't even need enough to get loaded, just enough to take away my pain.

1026^saltoftree^black^>"This person is technically less important than everyone else involved"

So much of this got directed at Katie Bouman when they imaged that black hole last year.

1026^saltoftree^black^I just woke up and I thought that person in the video was a heavy-set black man with a shaved head (like Charles S. Dutton). Then halfway through (when the lady's hair moved out of the way and part of her face was shown) I had a really weird moment as my brain came to terms with this black man being a white woman.

On a brighter note, I'm now one of those people who "don't really see race" so I'm sure that's gonna do me a lot of favours.

1026^saltoftree^black^It seems that way but by the numbers there is actually more variation *within* a given race than between races. The stuff that actually goes into making you black or white or Asian comprises a fraction of a percent of your DNA, and the rest of it has more variation than the stuff that's really obvious like skin colour. AND those variations are not correlated with the things we use to establish racial categories.

1028^witchbrew22^opiates^Magic mushrooms have been VERY effective for me in the past when used as a medicine!! I highly recommend it. I have treatment resistant major depressive disorder + CPTSD (complex post traumatic stress disorder). I have  turned to self medicating by way of opiates (primary) and other street and RX drugs as a means to cope, as many SSRIs and the like have so many negative side effects and run the risk for exacerbating the very symptoms we are seeking help from them for (depression worsens, suicide ideation increases, self harm &/or impulsive behavior ensues leading to increased guilt,  shame, & problems functioning in all life spheres)... 


3 winters ago i was newly clean from hard drugs. I still smoked marijuana daily as I continue to do,  and at this time I was drinking daily as well (( thankful that it wasn't to excess, though I did make .fool of myself at the bar in the VERY small  and very conservative town I lived in near the Canadian border in Washington state...not a good look when you work for well known/well to do people & gossip spreads like wildfire..yiiikes! ))  ANYWAYS~

During this time a family friend gave me a batch of psylocibin capsules she had made herself instructing me to take 2 every other evening at bedtime. I did as instructed and within under 2 weeks was noticing a MARKED difference in several ways:

-improved sleep overall

-waking and actually feeling RESTED (sweet baby jesus)
-improved overall mood

-felt & also appeared to others! As more calm, observant,level headed, OPEN... as in open minded sure of course... But I'm referring to something a lil different ~ when in the haze of debilitating Mental health issues it is common to become closed off, shut down, Feeling like you're running on autopilot, feeling like an imposter (I don't belong here/I don't deserve to be here, etc) ....  Idk,  I felt more open, connected, comfortable in my own skin... 

Like I was somehow more attuned to the rhythms of life dancing all around me on my walk to work each day.... colors in the sun rises & sunsets became richer, i could literally feel the difference in my body if i was eating healthy vs junky food and began learning to actually cook for the 1st time in my life (im 28) and began to view food as medicine too, & dipped my toes in all the great knowledge about the importance of a healthy diet, natural foods,  etc... bong bowls shared with friends + accompanied by hefty belly laughs became the most joyous experience one can imagine...

& with microdosing YOU DO NOT REALLY GET HIGH !**
Don't expect to see trippy visuals and all the fun party-esque side effects.. that's not the point and if you're seeing stuff you may be taking a teeny bit too much to call it a micro  dose? 

** but hey I am NO.expert on these things, this is just my experience & opinion, & to each their own. But I will say that I highly recommend it. It may literally change your life my dear, I am in need of a supply because I have extreeeemely limited access here,  considering learning to cultivate them myself because i am POSITIVE that I, along with my 64 year old mother,  & numerous friends or close acquaintances would benefit from having access to this medicine.  

Godspeed,  check back in here or even message me if you decide to give it a shot, I'd love to hear how it goes for you and would be happy to answer any questions if i can!

1029^nothingt0say^opiate^It's an opiate type drug, acts on opiate receptors, so it is normal that it made you sleep. You probably took a bit too much. It's easy to do. When I share it with people who don't do opiates regularly I give them only a half teaspoon and wait about 45 mins. If they don't think it's enough I add another half tsp. 1 tsp is a nice pleasant buzz for a beginner. 

However, that stuff is addictive and like a real opiate, causes physical dependence and withdrawal once you get to the point where you are doing it every day. So' if you find yourself liking it, you gotta be real careful not to do it all the time!

1029^nothingt0say^opiate^PWD is when and opiate addicted person takes suboxone too soon, before they are really sick.

If you are not addicted, taking a perc and then a sub right after... well, I don't think it would cause WD. But I've never actually done this experiment on a non addict. Has Dr. Subs, or does he talk out his ass?

1029^nothingt0say^opiate^Man thank you so much for all the posts, I went back and read them all. I just started methadone 5 weeks ago, but only this past week did I put down the fentanyl and the needle. I was a hope to die gutter junkie age 19 to 28, then clean on suboxone for 7 years and another almost 5 yrs totally opiate free. I relapsed at age 40, and now it's been a couple years hard running again. Thank you for providing hope!

1029^nothingt0say^black^I don't get to courtesy dose unless I do the paperwork 2 days in advance. I buy alot of black market shit, I'm away alot!

1030^EvergreenState425^opiate^I've been there. I did opiates for 10 years. Oxy first then bth the last 4yrs of my addiction. It took me a good 18 months before my bowels regulated back to normal. Scary right? I went to the doctor thinking I had IBS or Chrons or diverticulosis, but no in the end it was damage from years and years of heavy opiate abuse. From never shitting to shitting non stop sounds fun huh lol. Amazingly enough since I started kratom a couple years ago after I was clean a few years I have regular consistent bowels with no issues. One the main reasons i Keep using kratom today still.

1031^JamminJimmyJaye^black^I was Nate's comedy teacher at the Comedy College in Chicago in 2003. He talked about his experience there on Marc Maron's WTF podcast. Nate did 9 years of going out every single night when he went to NYC.  I just saw Nate  last spring and we were talking nuts and bolt stuff. He says he never writes a bit out any more he just tries to flush them out on stage.

I agree strongly with one of the comments, a lot of it comes from stage time.  I like to take bits to the stage I'm passionate about. The people I work with I tell them be a republican or dem but its hard to an independent in comedy.  Pick a lane and magnify it. Anyone at the top will tell you it's all about stage time.

Many friends that are at the top also ran their own shows because you can squeeze bit you think of right then and there and don't have to wait to try them.  With all that being said I think I'm finally on to something myself after 20 plus years. Louis Black said it took him 15 years to learn that audiences adored him when he started shouting at them.

1031^JamminJimmyJaye^black^I did a set with Lewis Black at Zanie's in Chicago just before he blew up, for sure. (Very friendly and helpful off stage) For sure total agreement. Sam Kinison probably me all time fav. Steven Wright spot on.

1034^chickensoupsucks^opiates^How long have you been clean now? 

One thing I've noticed about me is that I'm so selfish by nature that if I dont force myself to interact with other people then I will form no friendships/relationships... hear me out I'm about to rant. 


In my experience I can get dangerously antisocial, and I have a tendency to get stuck in bouts of depression which compounds my antisocial behaviour. As time goes on like this I begin pushing friends and family away making me lonely. Eventually I get so miserable I pick up and use some form of opiates. Once I put in I get that warm glow, that feeling of oneness and connection towards everything. I feel whole. However this feeling is fake and no one can feel that way forever eventually it stops working and I've dug myself into a whole deeper then the Mariana trench.


Once something catastrophic happens which forces me to stop I'm worse then I ever was. The only way to dig out of this hole, for me, is to essentially fake it until I make it. I force myself to wake up at a decent hour, go to the gym, clean my house, go to meetings, hang out with healthy friends, plan activities with friends, have dinner with family, etc. All of these things typically sound horrible to me but they are things that people with a healthy mind do. And crazily enough doing these kinds of things actually benefit my mental health. 


So basically for me. If I don't watch myself. I will only do things I want (watch tv sit at home) and push everyone away losing that sense of connection, become depressed, get suicidal, get high instead, lose all good things in my life and either end up in jail or a hospital. 


Or I force myself to be proactive by not procrastinating on chores, being abpart of other people's life, and making a conscious effort to form new and healthy relationships. 


Ive found the only way for me to be happy is for me to do things I dont want to do. As much of a paradox as that sounds.

1035^ohhoneyicried^black^Woah there. Frappaccinos I can agree with, no one believes it‚Äôs real coffee. But a latte is literally just milk and espresso, like any other cafe. The coffee and espresso beans are preference. And most coffee shops use an espresso machine. And like I said, local cafes and other coffee places all have similar prices. The only expensive items I‚Äôve seen is their frappaccinos, which are just fun drinks that they offer to pander to those who like sweet drinks. Now, you can believe that your pretentious view on espresso and coffee elevates your status as a connoisseur, but it really does not. Sure, some people are more about their brand and aren‚Äôt passionate about rEaL cOfFeE, but who cares? They make real coffee and also pander to those who aren‚Äôt looking for coffee but a sweet drink.


I‚Äôm not entirely sure how old you are, and maybe you‚Äôre just referring to your adolescent peers. Which would make more sense since I haven‚Äôt heard of many adults that give a fuck about a brand, just wanting their regular coffee at their regular place. Cold brews, pour overs, under tows, iced espressos and their French pressed coffees have always been very delicious and affordable. You can dislike it, of course. But saying it is so popular because of the brand is silly. I would suggest an uncut cold brew, black. It‚Äôs made fresh and very delicious :)

But now shes out of a job and probably wont be able to get a new one. What if she becomes homeless / broke or becomes resentful and joins the far right? She probably will lose all her friends and family over a slip, shit I'd probably kill myself if I was white and said the N word. This attitude is how Trump got into office.

1038^jenikaragsdale^pox^Woman like this piss me off to no end. My youngest got the chicken pox at 9 months old because of some asshat like this. However because I was vaccinated and he was breastfed I passed immunities on to him so he got an extremely mild case and even though I had never had the chicken pox I didn't catch them. Just like how vaccines are supposed to work! 

I've always been terrified of the chicken pox because my cousin died from complications from them the year before I was born (1984). He had them and unbeknownst to my tia got encephalitis. He looked perfectly healthy so she let him play outside he walked out and dropped dead before he reached the sidewalk at 7 years old. 

So again I'd like to slap the sh!t out of her repeatedly for putting other people's kids in danger!

Edit:words

1038^jenikaragsdale^pox^Thank you very much. It was drilled into my head as a child how dangerous they were. When I took my son to the er when he got them the dr told me I was lying because people don't die from the chicken pox! He literally made me cry. As soon as the vaccine was introduced me and my sister (who is now an idiot ant vaxxer) got it. My mother made sure to protect us and in doing so protected her grandson as well. Vaccines are amazing!

1038^jenikaragsdale^black^Looks like meth to me. I live in a small town that is overrun with meth, I work in a retail beauty supply store and cannot tell you how many times people come in doing this. They won't stop moving, wont stop talking even after asking a question they continue to talk over me and wont take my advice. I had a couple come in both acting like this, the woman who had box dye black hair wanted her man to bleach her hair blonde. Her hair was fried as it was I kept telling her that her hair would fall out, she kept talking over me just repeating nonsense about her plans to do it and have her man do it for her (he was tweaking exactly like this dude) I finally gave up and sold her all the shit to bleach and tone her hair. The dide was so bad he scared my coworker so she went on break and left me alone in the store with them ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.I've dealt with people like this for a long time but like hell wht the fuck would you do that?

1039^AbsoluteShambles^opiates^It has been a good day today. I'm clean and sober. I was watching my 4 month old son laughing and cooing earlier and it felt so good. 

I love the idea of opiates and getting high but that is all bullshit after all is said and done. There's so much more joy to be had in life. Love and hope for a better future that opiates just deny us when we are using.

1039^AbsoluteShambles^opiate^I went through subutex treatment in the UK and it was relatively painless. I was smoking heroin regularly - I can't quantify it but it was a lot and I was in a bad state. Then I went on 8 mg subs per day for about a year before I tapered down to 0.4mg and stopped. There was some discomfort when I stopped but it was totally manageable and didn't cause any real problems - nothing like acute opiate withdrawal.

If I were you I would ask the treatment centre about getting on subutex.

1039^AbsoluteShambles^opiates^So it is 48 hours since you last used opiates? That is encouraging if I understand correctly- this should be peak withdrawals right now so should all get better from here.

Careful with those benzos though, do you think you will be able to quit those soon as well?

1039^AbsoluteShambles^opiate^Not sure if it's the one you are thinking of but Ex Oblivione by H.P. Lovecraft is a lovely piece of writing.

When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim‚Äôs body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.

Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.

Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.

And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.

Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.

After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.

So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.

Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.

Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.

Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return.

But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hoped to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.

1039^AbsoluteShambles^opiate^Being clean and sober, not suffering from acute opiate withdrawal.
Having shelter/somewhere to live.
Having someone in my life who cares about me.
Having a job or the ability to make a living somehow.
Having food to eat and not going hungry.
Clean drinking water.
Living in a free and democratic society.

1039^AbsoluteShambles^opiate^>will my relatively long taper make it significantly more tolerable than, say, cold turkeying H to the nasal passage for a few months?

Not even comparable from my experience. I tapered down to 0.4mg per day and when I stopped it was slightly uncomfortable but entirely manageable. I was up early each day, looking after a newborn and working lots. I had slightly low moods and mild physical aches/discomfort. Exercise and stretching was the best thing for alleviating the symptoms which, as I say, were mild. 

It is nothing like proper opiate withdrawals - otherwise what would be the point in even using subs in the first place? You will be fine.

Get some kratom or subs or something to wean off opiates. Go to a therapist if you can and get on antidepressants. Every day is a struggle that you can win every day

1041^modethrash^opiate^Kratom doesn‚Äôt make me feel anything but energized. I haven‚Äôt touched any other opiate in about a month. I actually took 8gs of kratom earlier tonight hoping to catch a little buzz and I‚Äôm just laying here having trouble sleeping.

1043^Barbies309^opioid^I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through all that. It‚Äôs so hard to watch that happen. If you aren‚Äôt already in therapy I highly encourage you to talk to a professional because all of this has probably traumatized in ways you don‚Äôt even know.  And they would be the best person to help you navigate your boundaries in this situation.

It sounds like she has tried everything but if she hasn‚Äôt tried methadone yet, that would be my recommendation. It has one of the highest success rates for helping people stay steady long-term. And Suboxone would be second recommendation if there isn‚Äôt a methadone clinic. Like I said though, it sounds like you guys may have already tried that. And like any treatment, there‚Äôs no guarantee either will work 100% of the time.

She probably won‚Äôt be leaving her boyfriend anytime soon, so do what you need to do to keep your sanity as far as dealing with that goes. I‚Äôve found it more difficult to help people leave abusive partners than it is to get them off drugs. People usually stay with their partner until another partner comes along. 

My father, mother, brother and my current boyfriend all have struggled with various addictions over the years so that‚Äôs what my advice is based on. Personally, I also was prescribed daily morphine for two years ish and had to get off it and it‚Äôs when I realized what fucking utter hell opioid withdrawal is. And the process actually takes about two full years. So if you want any more insight on any of that, just let me know.

I will say people successfully turn their lives around everyday and all hope is not lost. As long as she‚Äôs alive she can still get clean. I‚Äôm sure you know this, but it would be a good idea for you have narcan nasal spray on you at all times ‚Äî and especially if you know you‚Äôre going to be seeing her. And see if you can get some training on how to use it if you haven‚Äôt already. A lot of harm reduction places offer the Narcan and the training for free. And you can get Narcan OTC in a lot of states in the U.S. now.

Good luck to you and just know you aren‚Äôt alone in this. I‚Äôm rooting for you and your sister. üíú

1043^Barbies309^opioid^I have a lot of experience with a lot of this, so feel free to reach out if you have any other logistical questions. Also my boyfriend has used literally every drug and he‚Äôs happy to answer any logistical questions as well. So feel to reach out and if I can‚Äôt answer, I‚Äôll ask him. 

[This](https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2019/7/17/a-survival-guide-for-opioid-withdrawal?format=amp) is more for opioid users, but it‚Äôs a really practical and easy-skim-list I wrote with my boyfriend about what to actually expect during opioid withdrawal and it might give you some insight. It‚Äôs a super easy read. Not sure if your boyfriend used opioids based on your question about crack, but sharing it just in case. It includes a lot of information that doctors tend to leave out.

1043^Barbies309^opioid^Yeah I found it to be the most helpful for me and my boyfriend. And I think a lot of the science is really showing the weakness in the ‚Äútough love‚Äù approach.  

I always say: If you want to break up with partner because of their addiction, definitely do so. But don‚Äôt break up with your partner hoping it will fix them and the relationship. Don‚Äôt break up with someone struggling with addiction hoping it will help them realize how amazing your love is and then hoping that will magically make them give up drugs. That doesn‚Äôt happen. 

I also have gone on and off prescribed pain meds over the last 7 years (I have a genetic illness that causes chronic pain) and I have experienced the hell of opioid withdrawal first hand so I think it probably made me more empathetic‚Äî for better or worse. My boyfriend is in a really good place right now though, so for us, it has helped. If you have any questions feel free to let me know!

1043^Barbies309^opioid^That‚Äôs awesome! Just know that psychological symptoms can last up to two years so try to get into therapy. I started having panic attacks out of nowhere about 10 days in. And then the suicidal thoughts were so bad I ended up in the ER a few months later.

I found a great psychiatrist who specialized in opioid withdrawal and it saved my life.

1043^Barbies309^opioid^Hello! I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with all of that. I can only give you advice based on my personal experience. If you‚Äôre not already seeing a professional therapist I would definitely encourage you to do so. And I don‚Äôt know how much of my advice is NA approved, I can only tell you what has helped me and my boyfriend.

For me, what stood out here was that he cheated on you. That‚Äôs a problem in and of itself. 

From there, deciding whether or not you can date an addict is something people rarely ask but you need to consider it outright. He will likely relapse again. Multiple times‚Äî even if it‚Äôs interspersed with long periods of trying to stay sober. You need to realize that a relapse is not based on or indicative of how much he does or doesn‚Äôt love you. And it‚Äôs a myth pushed on people that you can cure someone of addiction by showing them how much you love them and helping them realize how much they have to lose.   

So starting with your boundary of, ‚ÄúIf you use again, I will leave you,‚Äù it probably won‚Äôt be effective. Decide now if you can or cannot date an addict and then go from there. If you can‚Äôt, you might want to consider leaving now. If you can, start approaching it from that perspective.   

I read this to my boyfriend to get his perspective and he said that something that being a drug addict teaches you very quickly is exactly where actual boundaries are. And they‚Äôre usually not where people say they are. Basically until somebody enforces a boundary, you don‚Äôt have reason to believe that they will. The guide I linked talked about this, but whatever boundaries you decide to create you have to stick to them or he‚Äôll know they aren‚Äôt real and he‚Äôll continue to cross them. If you know that you actually will not leave this person if he used, but you still want him to get sober, then you need to change your strategy. 

So the way to deal with it is to figure out the addict‚Äôs  pressure points. For example, you could say, if you keep doing this, I know you don‚Äôt want your mom to know but I‚Äôm going to ask her to come over and sit with you. Or if you keep using while locking the bathroom door then I‚Äôm going to detach the door. The other thing is obviously limiting his access to money, as in ‚Äúif you keep doing this I‚Äôm going to open a bank account you don‚Äôt have access to.‚Äù 

Personally my boyfriend works but I have full control over all our money. My psychiatrist actually suggested helping me frame it to him like this, ‚ÄúIn every aspect of our relationship we are equal adults ‚Äî except when it comes to your addiction. In that aspect you are a child and I have to act accordingly.‚Äù That way I didn‚Äôt have to feel like I was treating everything he did like I was his mom because I was just frustrated in general, instead I could clearly separate when I needed to be in charge of certain things. 

Last thing, is my boyfriend does use Kratom daily. It takes two years for your brain to get over opioid use and Kratom can help bridge that gap. He also used suboxone to get off heroin. So you might want to talk to your boyfriend about medication assisted withdrawal if you haven‚Äôt already.

Hopefully some of this helped in some way. I have to tell you though that the cheating is separate from addiction and you need to think about whether you‚Äôre ok with that. Everyone who uses drugs doesn‚Äôt cheat.

1043^Barbies309^opioid^I completely understand what you‚Äôre going through.  

If you were my sister I‚Äôd recommend Kratom. It is a very mild opioid and you can get it over the counter and it will help a lot more than ibuprofen. You may need to be 18 or 21 to buy it but perhaps your parents could get it so you try it. I take it daily for eds pain (in combination with prescribed opioids and other medications) and it actually freaking works (unlike CBD for me). Some people love CBD though so if you haven‚Äôt tried that, I would recommend that as well ‚Äî although again you may need an adult to get it.   

I‚Äôm prepared to get some push back on here from people upset I‚Äôm recommending Kratom and CBD to a teen, but I personally know how much chronic pain sucks and how important it is to manage it. Kratom is mildly addictive but no more so than coffee was for me. If you have any questions about Kratom I‚Äôm happy to answer them. I actually write for a chronic pain site and wrote this [column](https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2018/9/17/everything-i-learned-about-using-kratom-for-pain)  about using Kratom for chronic pain (it‚Äôs not sponsored by any Kratom company or anything, I am a professional writer and I write for that site on a freelance basis).  

Don‚Äôt let anyone dismiss your need to get your pain under control. Good luck.  

Also, as it so happens, this is my seven-year anniversary of dealing with debilitating chronic pain and I actually posted this status to my Facebook today. (I live in the US so being in Germany is exciting for me).  

Status:  

Seven years ago, on the day after the Super Bowl I woke up with so much pain in my ribs that I went to ER. I spent the night in the hospital and left without any clear plan or idea of what was going on. Within six months I had moved to work from home for my full-time job, moved in with my mom, and quit my part-time job as a youth leader. Eventually I was diagnosed with EDS and the pain was attributed to nerve damage that was likely caused by gall bladder surgery that I‚Äôd had years before the pain started. It was nerve damage that I was more susceptible to it because of the EDS. 
The pain is still awful and the only reason I‚Äôm able to function and maintain my job is opioids. Without them I would have had to quit working years ago. 
I won‚Äôt lie, chronic pain does some fucked up things to your brain. I almost killed myself multiple times over those seven years.   

But today, I woke up in Germany. And the love of my life was lying next to me. Life is full of awful things. But it‚Äôs also full of amazing things. Keep going. And if you‚Äôre in chronic pain, find a doctor who believes you and is willing to treat you with every tool available.  

Because if the choice is suicide or opioids, opioids are always the better option.  

And anyone who thinks chronic pain wouldn‚Äôt drive them to suicide hasn‚Äôt actually been in chronic pain.

1044^krazikat^opiate^Us opiate addicts (our DOC before booze took over) know about PAWS all too well.

1044^krazikat^opiate^Huge accomplishment, congrats.  I'm one relapse after another.  Currently justifying opiate use in order to not drink so much.

1044^krazikat^china^Another reason why I posted... I never get to show off and use the fine China

1044^krazikat^opiate^Loperamide is an opiate that does not cross the BBB in typical doses. However, at high doses, it does cross the BBB and will relieve opiate withdrawal symptoms.  Taking high doses of Loperamide is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

1044^krazikat^opiates^Opiates give me that feeling.  But when I run out,booze makes for a nice and shitty fill in

1044^krazikat^opiate^I don't think anyone really knows... that's why prescribe it like crazy now... cause it's an not opiate or a benzo.  Pain, anxiety, RLS, withdrawal... take gaba

1044^krazikat^opiate^YES!   But unless there is something to the distribution of the actual medicine in the pill, that would be an awfully large dose of bupe.  The tablet is almost the size of the Pope's head! (Unless the orientation of the photo just gives that illusion.) 

Also, the part about wine being replaced with methadone ‚Äì so many people making Holy Communion would get so sick! Opiate naive church-goers are going to be sick for days!

I sincerely hope this isn't true.  I can't seem to find any news articles online.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1045^DrOpiumFiend^china^That and the fact that it's from China. I'm not Chinese, but I genuinely think that there are those who have an interest in perpetuating negative media coverage pertaining to China. 

I genuinely do not see any quality of the Corona virus which merits this level of media coverage other than the fact that it's new. Do you? Because I'd be very interested in hearing a counter-argument.

The flu kills about 35.000 Americans each year, and in bad seasons up to 70.000 Europeans - but you never hear those numbers in the media.

1046^sycnewtox^china^China is repurposing the AbbieVie HIV drug to combat the pneumonia from the virus (of course it is off label use). [China repurposing AbbieVie HIV drug to combat coronavirus. ](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma-asia/china-repurposes-abbvie-hiv-dug-as-big-pharma-rallies-to-help-combat-deadly-coronavirus)

1047^starchan786^china^This makes a lot of sense, the Economic impact this is/will be causing is still unknown. Flights are being canceled to certain parts of China (at least I know Air Canada has). They are currently dealing with something that can mean life or death for those at higher risk with age and preexisting conditions. 

So while it sucks it's something out of everyone's hands. Now how this might impact the actual game release (I believe they state in the arrival that there is no plans on delaying the game) or the console release to the rest of the world and if that might be delayed at well. AC being delayed (again I know) would really suck, but this is bigger then us and our games. I just hope everyone is staying safe.

1047^starchan786^black^For which console, I can link you to two I have both are hard shell but the switch lite one I have is from Amazon Japan it also comes in other colors 

OG Switch Case TomToc

https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0769CK4Z7/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_afZoEbJHEBV37

Switch Lite Slim Hard Case (Orange but comes in Blue Black and Pink)

 https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07VNR5PN6/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_SgZoEbTNJ0SG1

There is another case for OG Switch by the same people who made the switch lite case but it's not a slim case link incase you are interested also comes in Pink Green Blue Orange I believe 

 https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07HQRTJMS/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_GlZoEbD8C63A1


Edit: if you want pictures of the two I have I can take some. I really do love the TomToc case and almost wish my orange case was as thin, it's not BIG or anything and with my Switch Lite the case first with the Hori Clear TPU case on the actual switch, it also JUST holds the Switch Lite wearing the flip cover as well. With the TomToc for OG switch, it will not fit any protective cases at all, it's super thin but durable. I test dropped both with an old phone inside and nothing broke haha.

1050^jakeman2418^opiates^Think about having to lose all that sober time. I'm dealing with the same thing but with opiates. Legit had a few in front of me yesterday and forced myself to say "no I'm recovering" got drunk last night thinking it'd help send it did the opposite.

1050^jakeman2418^opiate^I never said I'm completely sober, I'm recovering from a terrible opiate addiction I stopped 8 months ago almost. I don't spend 60000 a year on alcohol or anything else like I did opiates. Won't drink again for probably 6 months if not longer. Only thing I'll probably do is smoke weed couple times a week after the gym. You can bash me if you want but I'm proud of myself for staying strong even when judgemental people tell me "I'm not doing it right". Enjoy your day.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opioid^There was one very inappropriately conducted study that showed that a small number of people that were regular, low dosage, kratom users, didn't experience decreasing testosterone during the study. It never had a lab from the people before they were users and it didn't explore higher level usage. Meanwhile, every other study covering opioid use, shows a decrease in T.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opiate^Was a complete opiate addict, myself. Kratom ended up being my drug of choice because of availability. Then it actually became something I relied on for the mental health aspect. Even on opiates (actually, more like "especially") I struggled with depression and anhedonia. Kratom took that all away and was way more effective than the Prozac I took for a while. Of course, that magic fades too. 

On the bright side, once you get through kratom withdrawals, you will start feeling younger and younger. I went form having achey joints that cracked and popped constantly (while using and in withdrawal) to moving around with no pain. I'm only in my 30s too. My back pain significantly improved after quitting too. That one took a while though.

1054^GrapeCulture69^black^I can't take NSAIDs so the only thing I can really do for pain is Tylenol/acetaminophen/paracetamol/APAP (not sure where you live, so I dropped all the names), but these are absolutely out of the question for you since you have liver issues. My other go to is pain induction. TENS unit and capsicum creams (they have dollar store ones for a good starting point. Don't start with the extra strength stuff or you will regret it) induce a little pain and really reduce overall pain. Probably an endorphin thing, but I won't pretend I know the science of it all. Also, black seed oil might offer some pain relief, but I don't know how it could affect your liver, so please ask your doc before trying that one out.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opioid^I never noticed any rebound from supplements, but gabapentin had some horrific rebounds. This stuff needs to be used very carefully, and it's probably good you aren't using it.

Also, I haven't personally experienced it, but some people have complained about rebound anxiety after using high levels of kava. My impression from their posts is that they were using it to catch a buzz every day, and then had problems going without it. They didn't seem like people using it intermittently, and at low levels, just for opioid withdrawal.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opiates^That's funny you mentioned the voice thing. My voice has dropped an octive or five since quitting. I talked to an ex co-worker last week, and one of the first things he said is that my voice sounds deeper. I hadn't even thought of it before he mentioned it. I think everyone is used to my having a high pitched, nasally voice from opiates. The nasally part is from the constant congestion from either being high or interdose withdrawals.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opioid^That's really unusual. And that doesn't seem like enough phenibut to affect your T like that, but it might be related. Maybe you just need sunlight and exercise to get your system running again. Definitely worth getting an endo/thyroid panel done just to see where you are at, hormonally. Also, check out DHEA supps, because opioid use depletes it and it's a precursor to sex hormones.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opioid^Anxiety, cravings and anhedonia are still pretty likely. Sounds like you had a pretty short usage time so you aren't going to experience what long term users go through. You still seemed of have been pretty lucky as far as acutes go. Maybe something you are taking is helping out without you realizing it. Either way, I don't think you will suddenly get hit with a wave of acutes, but the withdrawals definitely aren't done. 

There is also this weird phenomenon of an easy quit. I had a few of them over my years of opioid abuse. I always took them for granted, and the next quit would be miserable. Don't take this for granted and start using again, or you will for sure regret it.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opioid^Just wanted to remind you that you are tapering an opioid AND an SSRI when you taper tramadol. Besides the advice here, you could look at the taper and withdrawal subs and other online forums about SSRI cessation. Most commonly, people talk about Prozac. I know how bad those suck too. And there are definitely options. I would suggest researching (don't take without talking with your doctor, please) 5-HTP as it is a weak and natural SSRI and you can potentially replace the tramadol with that over time. Two warnings though. You have to taper off of 5-HTP too at some point. And you risk serotonin syndrome if you take it while still taking tramadol. This is a genuine risk and why I mentioned talking with your doctor. 

I wouldn't have even brought up SSRIs or replacements like 5-HTP if you hadn't been on tramadol so damn long. Your PAWS could potentially be drawn out and abnormally difficult. Not trying to scare you, but I didn't want you getting caught off guard with the feelings.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opium^I'm posting since there weren't too many answers, but I can only compare kratom with oxy, hydrocodone, and opium. 

Kratom is the worst withdrawal for me personally, because of the psych meds in kratom. The physical part is relatively mild, while the anhedonia, depression and anxiety are through the roof. The physical withdrawals of oxy are the most sharp and intense, and the physicals of opium are crazy because of how long they drag on for and what it does to my heart. They feel like a month long heart attack, and the diarrhea is the worst possible. Hydrocodone is a mix of all the above, but is actually easy to taper for some reason.

Kratom will be like a mixture of a really light heroin habit and a moderate to severe Prozac usage level. That's how it was to me personally. To back some of this up, I experience kratom withdrawals even when high on opiates, so I know I'm not dealing exclusively with an opioid withdrawal with kratom.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opiate^Thank you for the kind words. How did the surgery go? 

So my initial pain after surgery was very intense. I'm certain my tolerance is permanently increased. Took probably double the post op recovery meds it would have for an opiate naive person. And even worse is I got ALL of the bad opiate side effects from them. Nausea, dizziness, slurred speech, etc... And no euphoria. About 6 hours post op and I was feeling okay. The 5mg Norco didn't take all the pain away, but it made a huge difference with getting comfortable and getting some sleep. 

I learned a little trick that might help you if/when the pain meds aren't helping or available. Instead of trying to avoid and distract myself from the pain. I focused on it and let myself feel it. At first it was worse, but eventually, it made the pain go way down.

1054^GrapeCulture69^opioid^Loperamide taper will help. Caffeine for energy and the lope will combat the increased diarrhea that stimulants like caffeine/energy drinks will cause during withdrawal. Plus the lope is an opioid and will reduce your WD symptoms anyway. Start at 16mg (32mg would be the max and is basically a prescription level of usage) and taper down to 0 over 8 days. Seems to work well for most people.

1055^blackburrahcobbler^dreams^Your inner addict piping up is all, I'm having all sorts of nicotine dreams of the same sort, and still have the occasional dream (nightmare) about trying to work shit out with my ex. Just get that mind busy on other shit!

1055^blackburrahcobbler^opiate^Right back at you! Post when you need, as often as you need. And if you don't want to do that, you can dm me, I'm usually around. I suck at the particulars of opiate recovery, as they were not really an issue for me, use-wise. But boy howdy do I know what they'll make a person do, and I love helping people get away from them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1056^xxlilituxx^chocolate^OK, my husband and I are into age play, both in our sexual relationship and in our day to day relationship. I like it when after a hugely stressful day, I can put on a nightie and some cute plain white panties, and drink chocolate milk, and watch cartoons (Octonauts is my favourite) while sitting in my husband's lap. It is about caring and being cared for. In those times I am completely dependent on him to make all of my decisions for me. 

In a sexual context it is still about being dependent. For my husband it is about someone wanting him to teach them about sex (not about me being a child, but about me having no knowledge about sex and my body and how it all works, and why things feel good (for example, if he starts caressing my labia through my panties I can say "daddy why does that make me feel all tingly inside? It feels really good.") 

Now I need to reiterate that my husband and I are both in our 30s and have absolutely **ZERO** interest in children (whether it's sexual, or social, or in a parental sense). This is a relationship between two people who both gain something incredible from the dynamic. 

Also, there is a big size difference between my husband and I. He is 6'3, and 105kg (230lb). I am 5'1 and 45kg (99lb). So it is easy for us to play around with that dynamic ("Daddy you are so big, I don't think that I can put that in my mouth. I will choke.") 


If there is anything specific you want me to explain, feel free to ask.

1057^imthesock^china^When I insulted you, it was at 3am, I was tired and in a bad mood, im sorry, I do that sometimes. The thing I don't get is that the media clearly has a history of blowing things out of proportion. Like, "Deadly Storm Warning!!", then a few gusts go by. The media seems to thrive on panic and hysteria, that seems to be what sells. So how can one then believe that the virus is even worse than what they have been told? 

Also, I don't blame people for this, but I feel like alot of people on this sub actually want this virus to be big. Kind of like getting to sit back at home and watch a real disaster happen from the saftey of their tv/pc screens. So then those people naturally spread pictures of a dead person lying in the streets of China and claim to know for certainty that the media is lying to them.

1057^imthesock^china^Yea noone knows what is going on inside China. But if you look what is happening in other countries, you can start to paint a clear picture. And there have been zero reported deaths outside China. Just a single death would cause headlines because that would show that the disease can spread and everyone is in danger. But that has not happened. Even though alot of people fled Wuhan over a month ago. This disease has had the chance to spread but obviously it is not a threat.

1057^imthesock^china^Listen to yourself. Anyone who disagrees with your conspiracy theory is some sort of planted agent trying to brain wash you? How many deaths have there been outside of China? Or is every country in on your conspiricy? Perhaps the global illumaniti have formed a plan to cleanse the globe of the inpure and can control the media and leaders of every single country.

I am based in Thailand where apparently alot of people from Wuhan fled to. Noone here has died, there are no dead bodies lining the streets. I'm sorry, this isn't going to be a thing.

1057^imthesock^china^> What reality was it I needed to wake up to ?

? That is just literally a photo of two dead bodies lying in the street. With absolutely no context. Also, alot of people are crowded around to gawk, which tells us this isn't a common sight. How does that somehow prove that there is a huge deadly pandemic sweeping the globe? I guess if you blindly believed the media who have a clear incentive to write sensational fear mongering articles... 

Maybe if you should stop and consider that noone has died outside of China. Zero people.

1057^imthesock^china^Wow you are delusional.

"  Yes we know the Chinese are hiding the deaths." No. You don't know that China is hiding deaths. This is just a conspiracy theory that is just as likely to be false. And what about other countries? Are they hiding deaths too? Or is it just cold hard fact that ZERO people have died outside of China? Pretty low numbers for a pandemic I must say.

Also Thailand already started curing patients. I'm sorry but your doomsday fantasies are officially over. Time to wake up to reality dude.

1057^imthesock^china^Because I don't believe that there is some huge global conspiracy to down play this virus. I take the virus at face value, something that has killed zero people outside of China. If you act and think rationally, actually look at the confirmed death toll, you too will see that prepping for a pandemic is completely over reacting.

&#x200B;

I mean, once this virus has run its course, a few hundred people, maybe a thousand will be dead. Meanwhile tens of thousands will have perished from normal pneumonia. Wouldn't it make more sense to get all worked up over pneumonia instead?

&#x200B;

edit: aaand its been cured already.

1058^Greenmooseleg^opiates^If its keeping you sober, stay on it. Thats where I'm stuck too. I want to get off subs but at the same time I don't because it's what's keeping me straight on a daily basis. I know as soon as I get off I'm either gonna drink or have a one night stand with drugs sooner or later. Might as well stay on at a low dose. But that's me. I don't have anyone to talk about this shit since completing my out patient course. I really never want to do opiates again but might have a drink and/or smoke some buds in the future.

1058^Greenmooseleg^opiates^Damn, keep it up! I just hit a year and hopefully put many more years of life on the shelf since I quit drinking that poison. It gets easier as time passes man! Never thought I'd make it a year, let alone 22 days. But it is 100% possible. Just gotta be positive and think about of all the good that you will get out of it. Stay well.

EDIT: Stopdrinking is also my support group. I recently completed an outpatient program for alcohol and opiates. I don't go to meetings anymore, just wasn't my thing. And with this app in my pocket I can access it anytime which is more beneficial to me I feel. Had a lot of good conversation on there and I'm sure many more to come.

1058^Greenmooseleg^opiates^Keep it up! I just hit one year sober from opiates, adderall, alcohol, and weed.
