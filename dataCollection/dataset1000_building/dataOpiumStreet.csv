,,,drillyapussy,opiates,how do you come to that conclusion even as i child ive been interested in science spirituality the human mind and hallucinogenic plants as a teenager i began the exploration on occasion every 36 months  before ive consumed any drug ive researched it to the point that most people dont know i used to be addicted to cigarettes but lsd gave me the motivation to quit as i could feel tar coating my lungs stealing what felt like about 20 of my air a horrible sounding cough and a weird not able to clear my throat feeling when i was tripping it was more subtle but noticeable sober hyperaware of the damage it was causing now i have a much reduced cough which doesnt sound that bad and only a slight need to clear my throat feeling and i smoke a lot of weed i do use about 1 cig worth mixed tbh but thats much better than 1020 nonwater filtered smokes a day  besides that i know what opiates do to people from research and seeingmeeting a few addicts out there ive tried a couple out of pure 12x experimentation to see why people like the shit codeine was strong but gave me severe upper stomach pain and spins trams had no euphoria and slowed my breathing to an uncomfortable but non lethal level and oxy was okay it had no side effects and mild euphoria and and a nod which caused realistic but boring dreams within seconds of me on my phone or something and the 2nd time my friends and i snorted some and we all became agitated easily and unmotivated with no other effects   to me they dont feel good nor serve any good purpose to my health or mind to me psychedelics are my doc i like things that are interesting feel good spiritual and useful being half relaxed to unable to leave the lounge in a boring but content way is not my style ive got weed to feel good and relax me and its much more satisfyingsafe and its got a psychedelic edge to it which i love

,,,DrizzlyEarth175,opiates^dreams^black,felt this this is me with opiates tho dont get me wrong i love stimulants but opiates kill it all away without keeping me up for days fighting off the fbi agents from breaking into my housei mean even if you excluded the part about your dreams the fact that he stopped his truck to make eye contact with you is probably enough to at least have them create a report for the incident thats creepy especially given that you were fourteen at the timewhats your point the ss enforced under the guise that jews were less than humans and should be treated as such american police are not trained as such in the early 20th century if you called the cops because a black guy didnt give up his seat for you the guy would be beaten and arrested so what that was years and years and years ago things have changed comparing american law enforcement to the ss is what i would call grasping at straws   who are we supposed to call then nobody just put up our fists and hope for the best   maybe we should abolish the police and create some kind of organized trained group of individuals who are given the authority to enforce law and protect our citizens some criminals have guns so these people would obviously have to come prepared more prepared than the perpetrators they face we could give them firearms but criminals arent the only problem traffic violations kill thousands of people a year so obviously wed have to give this group their own marked vehicles to get around quickly and to enforce traffic laws again to keep people safe   see what im getting at police are a necessary part of any civilization some are bad most are good do a little research and youll learn that im not just some coploving racist twati hope this is true i feel his presence sometimes when i listen to certain music or go certain places i especially feel it in my dreams i had this dream once where i was with him and another friend whom is still alive and suddenly i realized i was dreaming and as soon as i did they both stopped what they were doing and looked straight at me i looked at him and said youre here he nodded but arent you supposed to be and he just nods as if he was expecting the question i went to reach out and touch him but i woke up probably from the excitement i really want to believe it was really him and he was really there with medipshit with a notepad who doesnt know how to handle their firearm  lol youre real fucking dense if you think cops dont know how to handle their firearms maybe some dont but like 90 of them do have you seen that video of the homeless guy holding up a store with a knife and the cop uses a 40mm round to literally shoot the knife out of his hand cops have to be trained vigorously to handle their firearms learn trigger and muzzle discipline and accuracy if you actually did some research instead of watching all the viral videos of cops shooting black people you might actually gain some insight into the world of law enforcement think for yourself dont be a sheep dont believe all the twitter videos that have no context or insight done into them cops save lives   some doctors fuck up and ruin peoples lives do we have an acronym for that adab no because we know they are the vast minority we just dont have a bunch of videos on twitter of doctors botching surgeries my childhood pediatrician literally molested his patients and his own granddaughter and had a toy on his stethoscope with a camera in it that recorded his patients in compromising positions probably including myself do i think hes a complete bastard who deserves to rot in hell absofuckinglutely do i think all doctors are bastards who deserve to rot in hell absolutely not   but you might say but cops are given guns and given the authority to shoot people blue man bad doctors are given the authority to touch peoples genitals nipples see their patients naked surgeons are given the authority to literally put people to sleep cut open their bodies and manipulate their insides some of them fuck up do we bastardize them no   use your brain cops are humans some are racist some are misogynistic some are murderers some are rapists doctors are humans some are racist some are misogynistic some are murderers some are rapists same with lawyers engineers scientists construction workers that one weird cashier who checked your shit at walmart my point is cops are humans like the rest of us some of them are bound to fuck up to be evil to use their authority to do wrong and such individuals should be recognized and face the consequences if humans are bastards some cops are gonna be bastards   if you ever god forbid get into a serious accident and require cpr at the scene and wake up to a cop doing chest compressions on you i sincerely hope your attitude changesim gonna get downvoted to shit but fuck it it needs to be said hard disagree ive met some shithead cops dont get me wrong but ive also met some pretty great cops too cops that shouldve taken me to jail but didnt cops that shouldve given me a ticket but didnt i agree police reform is an important issue but i also think that saying all cops are bad is shortsighted ignorant and dangerous cops get killed all the time because theyre worried what the public will think if they kill someone dangerous especially if they happen to be black or latinx innocent people die because of shit like this people block streets preventing emergency service vehicles from passing protesting deaths even though the police took lawful action   again ive met a lot of shithead cops the cop that killed philando castile was a shithead that cop that shot that woman during a wellness check was a dumbass dont promote hate for law enforcement push for better training for police officers more sensitivity training for police officers

,,,opiate_lifer,black^opiates^opium^china^opioid^opiate,i started investigating the social panic the usa experienced in the 5060s that is often mocked by modern media omg did you accidentally bring home a communist in your groceries type stupid paranoia  x200b  only in reality it wasnt baseless paranoia  soviet psyop agents had infiltrated universities and hollywood they would operate out of almost every soviet embassy or were recruited from russian communities in the usa even second gen immigrants  one of these was behind almost every single communist society or students for marxism type group at the head you had a literal propaganda agent who got their marching orders from the soviets  x200b  to be fair most of the us citizens recruited were just idealistic fools useful idiots or were just childishly rebelling against the usa in some way none of them openly realized they were basically pscyop shit stirrers for the su and in fact many would vehemently revile many of the cultural and societal attitudes of the su if they knew the ideas and values the su was spreading among academics were ones they would never have allowed to flourish in their own country  x200b  a lot of this shit didnt really actually come to fruition until the last decade it took time to plant society ruining values the hardest thing is i agree with a lot of societal disruption goals the soviets had like encouraging gay rights the civil rights movement interracial relationships black power movements basically the usa at the time and in a way still is a powder keg just waiting to be set off

showing the su was behind the nascent gay rights movement very ironic when the su was and still is very homophobic culture all the way to violenceright on a kindred spirit  i think this is a big aspect behind the odd lovehate experience some of these opiates induce some people want nod and only nod if youre not making them nod youre a waste of money some people love the energy etc  ive always wondered if there was a concrete uniform reason for the different actions across the entire board like you could just look at a novel rc opioids binding profile and molecular weight and instantly know how it would feel subjectively on averagesame mountains of studies and scientific evidence showing chronic use of opiates can actually worsen pain and perfection of pain  true or not they are just used to justify sending dependent people to the street to die fwiw i dont even like benzos love me some gabapentinoids throughshe most likely did not let it absorb correctly like just swallowed it however buprenorphine has a 10 oral bioavailability so as a total noob she still should have been hit hard by 020mg of buprenorphine  x200b  my guess is either she is a liar one of those people who have atypical first responses to opiatesa girl who once wanted me to initiate her had a moderate dose of codeine had no euphoria and instead got morose and was scaring me by saying stuff like she did not care whether a car driving by would slam into her and kill her o  or she just claimed to take it and really pocketed it because she wanted to look cool but was scared  x200b  for those concerned that girl never used opiates or other drugs to my knowledge and is alive and fine today with childgo to a bay known for pirates or one of the free streaming sites and watch the first two seasons of

day children are being raised for it to be normalized that machines with mics are monitoring your every word just for the convenience of being able to ask alexa what the temp will be tonight verballythis post was inspired by years of interaction and listening to people gossip about others sharing their true feelings and man it was depressing  x200b  but then my mostly estranged sisterwe are not estranged due to drug abuse shit like asking for money etc my wife called her to ask her to get me to stop taking all these pills for my mood like the tiny amount of buprenorphine i take a day they are even suspicious of stuff from the supplement section at walmart hmm vitamin d3  larginine magnesium glycinateobviously just subtle ways to catch a buzz these druggies are crafty  my sister told me she knew i never quit taking drugs from when i was a teenager exploring opiates while escaping my abusive controlling parents she told me this is why she tried to grab the entire pitiful inheritance after my parents deaths i did not need the money which i would just blow on ordering crazy chemicals like phenibut what is that some gay anus thing like poppers  she then told me that i obviously dont love my child which i am the primary caregiver for 100 financially support i only care about maintaining my own mood first if i loved him id stop taking everything even vitamins and put the money toward dubious therapies toward his disability id get 3 hell 4 full time jobs and not eat to get as much money as possible for treatments and not care about myselfmy wife btw barely does online work bringing in a few hundred a month i eat nothing but beans and rice and food on the clearance rack  x200b  i broke down emotionally screaming and crying over the phone to the point neighbors thought it was a domestic telling her how dare she who has told me only tell her good things she doesnt want to hear depressing parts of my life with my disabled son then she snarkily went oooooooooooooo look whose screaming and crying now youre probably high right this moment which is why i was finally able to break through to you and get you to cry haha this just set me off further  i had been looking to her my older sister for emotional guidance and support but instead got sniped at just like my parents used to do  she was also furious i got her daughter who was a blackout alcoholic spending 50 bucks a day at the bar turned on to baclofen and her daughter said its amazing a baclofen a day along with a wellbutrin and she hasnt had a desire to drink or go to the bar in weeks but stilll has to for social occasions at work but she baclofen helps her moderate herself my niece a major reason she wants to stop drinking is once a man took her home when she was blackout and she considers what happened rape saying she woke naked on a bed and she realized she needed out of this life which is a big reason i wanted to help her my sister was furious im practicing medicine without a license and getting her daughter to order crazyuncontrolled drugs online from sketchy drug dealers she said let her drink herself to death its what she deserves btw the wellbutrin and baclofen are rxed to her by her doctor he also rxs her clonazepam and gabapentin which my niece said she no longer feels any need for or desire to take but she will stock pile it for the future  x200b  this is also the woman who lost custody of her son because she hung herself in the garage and she was the only adult around except for her teenage son who came home and found and saved her and called 911 this is also the woman who has had every drug in existence rxed to her for fibromyalgia including fent patches and xyremyes rx ghb and 80mg oxys back in the day and dilaudids and benzos and soma the list never ends i helped her endless times like when her husband called me because she had been overusing her rxed amount of fent patches wearing multiple at once then had a fight with him and in the heat of the fight she flushed all her pads and even ripped the ones she had on off he said she just laid on the floor for days moaning and vomiting and emiting diarrhea at the same time and he did not know what to do i helped her but she went to the er eventually she buys pot in a felony state and smokes daily  but i am a dirty evil drug addict  x200b  my wife also hates when i take anything from a vitamin bought off the clearance rack of a health food store or anything else pill like vaguely you should feel how you naturally feel if vitamin d3 makes you feel better thats unatural and wrong  x200b  i try to avoid my family i became a digital nomad to escapehuman weakness is fed off of by human strength and im not being literal of course  this is why communism on a size large than a family group falls apart were designed to play this game  x200b  edit to make it perfectly clear i am not defending daily benzo use for anxiety however here we are and a lot of people are dependent on their scripts stable dependent and functioning for decades and alive now if they are all yanked off cold turkey and run to street thats what im against  provisions should be made for those already dependent as their lives depend on it just like with opiatesmy guess is that gabapentin will become the new go to for generalized anxiety until it too is scheduled and cracked down and around and around we go  pharmaceutical companies in the usa have been playing this game a long time remember morphine was the nonaddictive replacement for that evil addictive opium  then they introduced heroin to move the morphine addicts to andcheck out what is going on in china right now they are arresting labs for selling caffeine powder according to the sarm subs some kind of far reaching legislation against providing chemicals in raw form or something illicit supply of anything is delicate  you also assume potential consumers are as informed and sophisticated as posters here  i mean in the recent past there are people including celebrities buying pressed xans that are really fentalog off the street in probably the golden age of not only rx benzos but rc benzos tooi tend to apply a sort of filtering method to these tolerance or potentiators of the day that i have seen countless numbers of come into and out of style turn out to be bunk turn out to be real and everything in betweeni suspect there has been a lot of guerilla marketing going on over the years if you catch my drift anyone remember when cats claw got to the point of flyers up in methadone clinics  x200b  whether the thing is worth trying is mostly based on cost proposed benefit and potential downsides like are there are reports of potential liver toxicity etc if its cheap enough or enough of a commodity and has a high enough proposed benefit and no reports of downsides might be worth trying but most of this shit is flash in the pan nonsense or actual bad faith astroturfing there have also been actual cases of methadone or some obscure opioid or rc opioid being found in these chinese herb blends that would make the rounds on the boards for halting tolerance increase   x200b  there are a couple supplements i will defend with my life like vitamind3 just based on cost potential benefit and subjective possibly placebo effect no matter what new studies come out and are touted by the anti supplement brigade im not a total robot there is no worldwide monolithic zionist jew cabal working on a singular goal of world domination for thousands of years thats silly and beneath discussion  x200b  there are however concentrations of jews in certain industries with wide reach and importance that should give people pause and most of these groups have goals totally at crosssections anyway a republican duel usaisraeli citizen working high up in middle east affairs in the state department advocating for more middle east adventures to fight israels enemies for them isnt going to have much in common with a super liberal and woke atheist jew in nyc who writes articles about whether your cat is genderfluid or not  x200b  a few years ago i started paying attention to these bizarre almost social engineering propaganda articles about bizarre sex or family arrangementsit takes a true intellectual to enjoy watching your wife getting pleased by a black bull and googling the author and heh yup jewish the articles would often come out in bunches so it was obvious these authors had some discord or forum somewhere they were talking about and coordinating this crap that seemed designed just to agitate or rile up people  i got bored of it when a really bizarre group of articles appeared advocating an insect based diet googled the authors and well look at that amusingly the chick who wrote the article for vice freely admitted she got really sick and ill on this diet for future plebs when she tried to live off of it a week lol this came out of nowhere and seemed to be a floater almost testing what the public will accept  x200b  variations on this have been floating around for years not sure if this is the same one but once i actually looked into it and most accounts and tweets could be confirmed as real  httpspbstwimgcommediadlnlugxvaam9m7rjpglargehttpspbstwimgcommediadlnlugxvaam9m7rjpglarge  if you search fellowwhitepeople on twitter there are tons and tons some even further classified down like jews in x business doing this some is obviously faked but when the meme first appeared i out of fairness googled and was shocked a lot could be confirmed  then there is the jaw dropping things said in media intended only for jewish consumption like the fact young jews outbreeding is a second holocaust   httpsmondoweissnet201907intermarriageholocaustconversionhttpsmondoweissnet201907intermarriageholocaustconversion   x200b  anyway this has been your sick antisemitic altright post of the dayoral opium is my favorite opiate of all time i have grown poppies and tried to harvest opium i have followed and participated in long long threads of others doing the same in a backyard context with one or few workers and always ending in failure or at least disappointment its a waste of time if you want a heroin type nod an even greater waste  x200b  however growing and consuming papaver somniferum pods green or dried works perfectly and is both rewarding and will get you high warning withdrawal is horrendous for the high you getwhich i like just fair warning that trying to cold turkey pods is a quick path to fent or heroin addiction have subs or methadone on hand  x200b  the corporations that currently grow psomniferum for the alkaloids just harvest the entire plant with machines at what they assume is the peak of alkaloid contentwhich varies like a mofo then grind the pods and other plant material they catch the seeds for sale to the food industry then heat and chemically process the poppy straw to extract the alkaloids  x200b  doing things the old fashioned way was more art than science in predicting weather top opium flow rate and required vast amounts of highly trained and otherwise useless seasonal work force to manually lance the pods and collect the opium after aka afghani slave girlsdaughters  after this the raw opium was dried manipulated exposed to sun and otherwise esoterically processed it would be further processed and treated each time it changed hands from the farm all the way to the local opium den where the owners and servers often had their own esoteric processing methods and even preheating before it reached consumers  books have been written about this there were entire industries making all sorts of esoteric tools like there is no in the legal weed industry ive seen claims such as tests at the time showed some alkaloids did not even vaporize at the temps some dens were using so some people might have basically been vaping morphine while others were vaping papaverine mostly or who even knows what the mystique of opium involved a lot of social bullshit just like alcohol does now  httpscommonswikimediaorgwikifileconfiscatedopiumpipesinhawaiic1920jpghttpscommonswikimediaorgwikifileconfiscatedopiumpipesinhawaiic1920jpg  x200b  i have seen pictures of ornate metal opium den tools that somehow survived seizure and melting for scrap that modern scholars are totally baffled about its function  objects like below appear on the market occasionally

x200b  my advice this whole period and way of drug use is gone and extinct and it would take industrial level activity to bring it back however orally consuming pods green or dry is wonderful and gives a great subtle energizing high my advice is to spread washed poppy seeds from pst far and wide near you look up the correct planting time and they love disturbed soil just return and harvest when the pods are readywill this be your first ever opiate experience  if youre a small body size take 1 pill and dont combo it with anything get a feel for the opiate experience if you have a large body size take 2 or 1 and a half for the first time  x200b  there is a limit to both how much codeine can be metabolized by each body at once and over a 24 hour period those numbers you see for 300400mg thats either a rare super metabolizer or a 24 hour metabolism rateedit  some seem to be misunderstanding that in the billionaire reality there are no psychoactive drugs at all not just opiates

,,,rainbowrider33,opiate^opiates^opium^opioid^black,my opinion  up until recently there was little money to be made in studying addiction or treatment opiate detox was an unwanted burden to be disposed of as soon as possible so there is a lot of guesswork almost all opiates are schedule ii controlled substances and the perception is that doctors risk losing their licenses and even criminal prosecution for being involved in prescribing opiates our justice system needs some serious reformthe question i have is will you end up just substituting kratom for opiates personally i would love to use kratom to get off oxys i have tried kratom before and it did nothing for me as far as a high goes but if i could use it to get through withdrawal and then just quit kratom that would be awesomeimo nad is a very expensive scam from what i have seen they talk about people feeling better after 5 or 6 days of iv therapy the problem is you are going to feel better anyway after 5 or 6 days in most cases cost is between 510k depending on length of treatment   ibogaine is the only treatment i have read about for opiate addiction that seems to cut out withdrawal symptoms and cravings it is also expensive and you have to go to mexico or canada to do iti would definitely think you need to go more slowly for a long acting opiate from what i have seen if you take an opiate for more than 6 months you have a much better chance of avoiding relapse if you do a gradual detoxheroin is never going to be legalized unless the problem gets much much worse marijuana had investors willing to lobby for years no such luck with heroin there is no money to be made and as such no spokesmen to push congress to change the law everyone that matters meaning cops politicians and cartel people have a vested interest in keeping it illegal if the opium epidemic got bad enough maybe it would be decriminalized but as it stands now that dog wont huntwhat influences the amount of time an opioid binds to a receptor is that just a characteristic of that chemicali would bring in a really good chiropractor that can test your muscles and tell you which ones need strengthening one thing i have learned about pt and chiros they tend to work towards the lowest common denominator meaning the exercises they prescribe are a one size fits all solution if you are young and strong you may need to bump it up   yoga is super helpful not your grandaddys yoga but some of the more intense methods like hot yoga working on balance really helped me because the same muscles in your feet and legs that let you balance are muscles involved in how you use your back   if you have already tried other stuff my prescription would be 1 intense yoga 2 high doses of tumeric with black pepper and 3 a month of really clean eating  a lot of people would tell you that you can never go back to tramadol and other drugs of abuse i dont know   i would give abstinence at least 30 days in the meantime you can try other stuff if you want you didnt mention anything about your diagnosis but there have been many many people that have conquered their back pain with exercise and smart treatmenti havent had any interaction with addiction medicine docs in years but i have to admit it always seemed sketchy i am glad there are at least some doctors who are willing to put the work in to understand opiates which is the reason why i had to ask this question about tapering in the first place there are some very well educated people that are absolutely convinced that it is impossible to get off opiates without that big kick at the end  the theory that was presented to me was that the body cannot start producing endogenous opioids until the receptors are completely clear of outside compounds so if you take even 10 mg of oxy for example that will set you back until it is eliminated from the body and whatever signaling process we use to manufacture natural opioids resumes once more  i was told that this is what they teach in medical school even though it is not really logical and contradicts many many people on reddit especially the numerous accounts of kratom users who have used that substance to get off opiates  but as long as i have this opportunity to ask questions i would like to ask if you have any experience with the bridge device see link below or electro acupuncture to suppress withdrawal symptoms i have been reading about acupuncture and nerve stimulation of various sorts for years as a way to bypass withdrawal but the one thing i have never seen is a credible opiate addict saying that they beat addiction by using this method at one point i was so desperate that i bought a box of acupuncture needles and spent all morning sticking them into my ears in an attempt to obtain relief  i also got a 9 volt battery and was trying to figure out the best way to pass a small current through my ears but gave up before i managed to find a workable method   any input  httpswwwmedscapecomanswers28779085622whatistheroleofthenss2bridgedeviceinthetreatmentofopioidwithdrawalman i really appreciate your responding the thing with me is that i have been on opiates for several years and am now ready to get off i was once on methadone but for some reason any sort of opiate seems to drain me i dont have a normal amount of energy when i take them and i find it hard to do even regular life stuff like shopping or whatever  i kicked cold turkey last year and stupidly relapsed i am not eager to cold turkey again because it was viciously painful but i am willing to suffer some to get clean i think maybe this time around my sobriety will be more valuable for me because i have to work for it and for me the opiate high simply is not worth all the pain that comes with it anymore  so i am passing on substitute opiates i think it is the best decision in my case   i am pointing people to your post on tapering which i hope is ok with you there is far too much opinion and not enough actual experience on this topicthe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few  unless you are talking about a very mild opiate that most people would never consider taking unless it was the only thing they could get politicians will do anything for another vote i dont know how those people sleep at night

,,,thenardwrangler,opiate,trying to argue that drug addiction is a survival need might be the most laughable thing youve said in this entire thread  its a reasonable comparison for opiate addiction i actually got the idea from medical literature at my methodone clinic  opiate withdrawal is essentially your brain alerting your body that you are going to die if you dont get something asap    yes drugs are bad for you  there i accounted for the damage done by the drugs themselves if only that was the only thing i had to worry about  when youre an addict people treat ya like a lot of the commenters in this thread are treating me  addicts and homeless people are subhuman in todays society

,,,RusselDunbar,black,thank you for your compliment i take it as a compliment you saying im funny because i love writing and while i love writing i mostly write about some really depressing stuff and what i hate about that is people getting a funny taste in their mouths as they read what i just wrote so i try to make it a little lighter with some humor every now and then dont get me wrong im still writing about some depressing ass stuff and im not a standup comedian at all i just like my depressing writing having some sort of flair that makes people not take it as super serious as it maybe should be taken and over everything else i love entertaining love it so thank you for complimenting me and my wit i highly appreciate it      about the rape fantasy sure youre maybe just that sick but dont take offence with me saying that youre that sick thats just the way i need to look at this to comprehend the thought of someone getting a hardon thinking about all those years after such an event where youd feel dirty and unclean never being able to clean yourself of what happened feeling depressed not getting understanding anywhere and eventually probably killing yourself      or thats my estimate the reality could be totally different sure im just some nut job on reddit thinking he can analyze some other nut job on reddit without as much as knowing his real name dont take my two cents if this is something you truly feel you want in your bones as deep as every single bone in your body goes then heck go for it my dude arrange some group of women to abduct you or drug you and making all your dreams come true pay them even      but what youve talked about reminds me of someone i once saw in a movie and have heard jokes about ever since me never realizing it was a real thing but eventually just googleing it and even when ive been perverting around fetlifecom seen some people who do this in real life      have you seen pulp fiction remember the scene where bruce willis rescues the black guy from some sweet sweet anal rape in that scene is an individual whos generally known as a gimp which is basically just someone who sometimes gets paid money sometimes pays money himself for that status but in the end is always just a toy to be kept around in a dungeon for whenever the owners have or find the time to use and abuse him for prolonged periods of time sometimes the torture can range from hours to days days to weeks weeks to months at a time      have you ever thought about becoming such an individual youd of course make your terms and deal with the owner of the dungeon but in the end youd get what youve always wanted getting molested in every which way till next sunday      and about this  there‚Äôs a reason that there is plenty of porn out there where the woman is roleplaying the rapist and the man is the unwilling sex slave that‚Äôs because there are probably a lot of men that actually want to be forced to have sex with a woman      im somewhat known as a professional pervert myself my latest fetish being young and petite asian girls because their tits always just seem to look so absolutely delicious i swear in like 98 videos of a 100 the tits on those asian gals are most often than not absolutely perfect and just the sight of those holy grails makes me cum buckets every single time im a tit man if you hadnt noticed      but yeah being a pervert and having jerked it over everything from young and petite asian girls to tranny porn where the chick is dominating the guys asshole and mouthi was once hardcore into that dont feel it anymore though i can probably with as much certainty as i possibly can say that ive never noticed this female dominating the man into unwanted relations aside from some motherson porn which is kinda my guilty pleasure and secret shame at the same time      im very curious as to what one would write into xvideoscomhttpsxvideoscom to find such porn can you enlighten me maybe youre contagious with this style of porn that youre into and its possible that i might get into that whole thing if i like what i see please do tell me how i find such porn and send me your favorite clips via private message if youd like to get your perv on and share some of the stuff you love the most with an openminded individual who has been able to jerk it to all sorts of porn aside from gay porn i have tried but theres just something about a guy fucking another guy in the ass that repulses me in every way      i love you man thanks for constantly replying to my replies and please do send me some perverted shit via dm please do d

,,,Johndough1066,opiates^opiate,blame is pointless just give people who are kicking opiates methadone period that should be standard treatment everywhere  jail or the streets it should be protocol in every jail and hospital and doctors office   no one should have to suffer from withdrawal symptoms everi think if you took bupe after oxy or something too soon you would still go into pwd even if you werent addicted previouslyim not sure but id bet on it  youd lose that bet  have you read the other replies you should   how can you go into precipitated withdrawal if there is no way you can go into withdrawal do you understand   i dont think it has anything to do with regular withdrawal   uh it has everything to do with withdrawal it precipitates the withdrawal do you know precipitates means   for the most part i think it makes you sick beacuse you are on opioids currently and the bupe interferes  the bupe prevents the opiates from getting on your receptors that doesnt matter if your brain is producing normal amounts of dopamine which it would be doing if you are not addicted   but if you are addicted your brain is not producing dopamine when the opiates cant get to your receptors and there is no dopamine being produced you go into withdrawal   id go as far to say if you asked any sub doctor if an opiate nieve person took some oxy and a sub 3 hours later would they go into pwd in a non biased way they would all say yes  if a sub doctor told me that and none ever has id get a new doctor immediately   why dont you actually ask some sub doctors and find out heck a doctor gave one of the replies on my thread he agrees with me   if you argue with them a little they might alter what they said beacuse its not worth pressing the matt  why would anyone do that  why do you believe things for which you have no evidence whatsoevernot true at all if youve never been physically dependent on opiates before you can use for three days and you absolutely will not get a physical dependency it can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first startnot true at all if youve never been physically dependent on opiates before you can use for three days and you absolutely will not get a physical dependency it can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start  of course the fentanyl can kill you so why risk iti never get high from methadone either but its a great way to kick without acute withdrawal symptoms keep it around just in case you cant get your opiates  you only need a few days worth of methadone to kick heroin or oxy with greatly reduced or no acute withdrawal symptoms  you might need as little as 20 mgs a day for 3 to 5 days  or more mgs but not days depending on your habit you cant get addicted to methadone in such a short time   so hold onto it keep it around for emergencies i snort 810 of them for my first dose and then usually do the rest about 68 hours later i am usually done ingesting them by midnight and pass out sometime after dawn i will sleep until 1 or 2pm and then take my suboxone an hour or so after waking up is this something that would normally send people into precipitated wds   absolutely not you only get precipitated withdrawals if you are addicted to an opiate like heroin or oxy etc and then you take suboxone   what youre doing doesnt cause pwdnot true at all if youve never been physically dependent on opiates before you can use for a week and you will not get a physical dependency it can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first startalso the kick on h is way shorter than percs   what not real percs its not  kicking pills  legitimate pharmaceuticals  is much easier and shorter than kicking heroin   fent gets everyone fuck china for ruining opiates  fuck china for so many thingsthey powers that be here in the us are definitely making it much harder for anyone to be prescribed opiate pain medication but its not actually illegal   and that is a very important point   there are doctors who will lie and say it is illegal these doctors are scared but that doesnt excuse lying   what this poster was up to i dont know
,,,diedro,opiates^opiate^opioid,resist the urge to use youre doing really good getting to 4 days you will be able to sleep without opiates in time maybe you can get another sleeping aid like a benzo the anxiety and cravings are normal try to distract yourself and keep busy if you relapse now you might still be using when your partner gets out and they might end up relapsing now youve both got a chance to get cleanit is amazing being free of constipation that was one of the worst side effects of opiates for mecongratulations on 4 weeks im 1 day behind you came really close to relapsing 3 times due to stress but somehow managed to resist for me the last symptom to go which i still get sometimes is sudden attacks of anxiety and sweats especially in the night i agree working out helps even just as a way to fill the time youd normally spend in the opiate bubbleive found them helpful i used them with opiates before i properly quit in one trip i saw myself standing in an open grave taking pills after each trip i had a greater desire to stop using and it felt easier the next day i have used them after stopping and found the experiences very cathartic and emotional they have helped me feel compassion for myself they help bring up and face the pain i was suppressing with opiatesive had it with opiates but not tried it yet when clean im interested though might give it a go  umrbrinks not sure if that will link properly has tried itpregabalin  clonidine are really good for acute withdrawals i switched to diazepam for a couple of days after that and found it very helpful but only use for a couple of days medicinally for sleepanxietypain you dont want a habit for benzos as the wds can be worse  more dangerous than opiatescongratulations on 5 days clean its nice knowing people can relate the opiates wont fix these problems itd just be a fake relief i think the only way is to just face it and do what we canopiates can cause sphincter of oddi dysfunction this can result in elevated liver enzymes and there are cases of pancreatitis which have been attributed to opiates seems to be worse in people who have had their gallbladder removed  httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc5276812nice work youre doing really well a bit of kratoms a lot better than h im struggling with depression too but i was depressed during my use too one thing im trying to do which might be helpful to think about is be more accepting of feelings and try not to avoid them thats what opiates were for mehad a few mild trips while on opiates then stopped and had a 2 after the acute withdrawals first was fairly strongive been drinking since quitting opiates in the past there was a time when i slipped in to drinking a bit too much but ive never had a problem or addiction to alcohol only opioids i enjoy dinking socially sometimes biggest issue with alcohol for me is the toxic side effectshangover is horrible and has been an excuse to use opiates in the past i also think its a far inferior drug to opiates i have known people who had stopped drinking and then decided to have just 1 drink and ended up wasted on cocainepills gambling going strip clubs etc within hours and going on a bender for some people alcohol really can lead them on a bad path fast i think you have to decide for yourselfyou are right thanks for the advice its just so hard to resist sometimes when im stressed and start really considering the opiate escape hopefully i can overcome thisit is normal to feel depressed when you stop you are going through a big change and youve been through a lot already let yourself acknowledge the sadness and feel it while it is here and have a little faith that time will help it to pass us opiate users spend so long numb to the world and our emotions that when we stop it overwhelms us im at day 21 and still struggling with depression best of luckif you want to stop i think you need to decide to get clean and commit to it plan ahead get the supplies youll need food drinks comfort meds in advance you could try a slow or fast taper accept that getting off the opiates will feel bad and give up your resistance to feeling bad you are not weak opiates are strong best of luck to you you can do iti have some naltrexone i used it uldn alongside dihydrocodeine for a couple of weeks before withdrawing last year really helped reduce the diarrhoea at least i havent tried it since stopping but i was thinking it might be a good idea supposed to upregulate opioid receptorskeep it up power through distract yourself accept it and commit you will feel better soon you just have to give yourself the time to go through it then youll feel healthy without opiates
,,,DopeGuy1234,opioid^black,for tooth pain is ibuprofen infact way better than an opioid also idk why you guys in the usa are acting like you need opioids for every small injurie here in my country the docs dont prescribe opis that much at all they first trie other pain pills and if they dont work they start giving you opioids and also they dont start with stronger ones like oxy they first trie tramadol and tilidin dhc and codeine mostly tilidin and if they are also not working good enough then they start giving you oxy but yeah you guys got so used to battling every pain with oxy thats insane and also if you get 4 wisdom teeth out here they give you ibu 800mg and a script for 20x100200mg tramadol also they prescribe here much smaller packs we got 3 script sizes n1 is 2 blisters a 10 pillsblister n2 are 5x10pillsblister and the biggest ones are n3 with 10x10pillsblister if someone with cancer for example needs more pills cause he will die for sure then they start giving you more and stronger pills i know a guy who got cancer and he will die in the next 12 years from it and then the docs will make it as comfortable as possible he gets 2xn3 packs of 80mg er oxy and a n3 pack of 60mg ir oxy for breakthrough pain and also he gets 68 x 100mcghour fent patches he is often very high cause he dont uses the fent patches as prescribed cause he dont like them that much he just uses them if he really is in big pain he then uses about 23 fent patches a month and is nodding the whole time also he probably needs to go to a hospize to die he will go there for his last 36 month if he wont be able to die at home but yeah i can understand you you guys got norcos hydros oxy etc way faster than ppl here in europe and thats why you are so used to ityeah i remember when they took out my wisdom teeth they took out first the right side and then 34 weeks later the left side cause my teets already broke theough and were way too big for my mouth so mostly here in germany you get ibu or metamizol paracetamol for tooth pain i got a pack of ibu 800mg and a pack of paracetamol 600mg after the first night i had to go to a emergency dentist cause it was saturday and no dentist was open and because i bleed so much i had to puke a few times in the night and that tore apart the strings of the wound i was in extreme pain and the energency dentist gave me a script for tilidinnaloxon 20016mg which is the most prescribed opioid in germany its a good opioid for pain and also if you take more of them you can get a nice buzz off of them at first my mom didnt wanted to get me the tilidin cause opioids are soo bad and she is in general against all medications she wanted to give me globuli and a few other shit of nature healing shit thank god that my dad still lived back then and he got me the script from the pharmacy and after 7 days my face was still swollen and i took all the tilidin just a small pack he went to that emergency dentist again and got me a n2 pack n2 means that its a pack of 5 blisters in one blister are 10 pills at first i had a n1 pack with 2 blisters for the second wisdom surgery my dad drove me and he told the dentist to give me a script for ibu paracetamol and tilidin and that he should give me a n2 pack minimum my dad could do such things very good he was polite but you knew that he wont leave untill he got what he asked for he was an awesome person miss you so much dad i still know that he took me once to his pain doctor and he told the doc that the tilidin and morphine isnt working anymore and that he wants to get oxy er 60mg cause he got that after a surgery for a few weeks and it helped very much so he talked so long untill the doc gave him a script for oxy er 60mg and also the doc added a script for oxy ir 40mg and also a script for 100mcghour fent patches he got enough patches for a month if he uses two of them in a week but he just used one a week and sometimes none so after he died he left a stash of 400x20016mg tilidinnaloxon 200x60mg er oxy 150x40mg ir oxy 60 100mcghour fent patches 600x200mg tramadol and 200x120mg dhc and about 50x10mg diazepam and 80x2mg clonazepam all the amounts are a round abound if i write 400 pills it could have been 390 for example i just remember them really good cause after my dad died we got alot of benzos i especially became much more cause i found him dead and got ptsd from that also my doc already knew that i had depression before my dad died so i got a big script for alprazolam 1mg lorazepam 25mg and diazepam 10mg so i digged through the stash in about 68 month also my brother took a few pills but only about max 50x20016mg tilidinnaloxon i brought the whole stash in my room after about 2 month and told my family that i threw them away cause 1 i couldnt see them anymore and 2 my dad and i shared our cabinet in the mirror cabinet i hope that makes sense lol and my family believed me when i just had about 100 pills left to stay well i started meeting ppl on the streets who used mdone and i got a 40mg blister 10 pills again for 60‚Ç¨ i then used about 80100mg mdone daily for a month then my plug went mia then i tried heroin cause i wanted to try it so badly and immediatly fell in love that was about 810 month after my dad died the next 2 years i used daily about 1g of h 3 and for the last 68 month of the 2 years i also used about 812mg clonazepam daily in between i mixed in also meth coke crack many different benzos and many different opioid pills my favorite pill beside oxy ir are tapentadol currently i really like them very much i maintained myself with them for about 2 weeks and tapered down at the end of the taper i had no wds which never worked with mdone or any other pill if i could get a monthly script for enough of them then i could live a sober life for sure lol sorry for the wall of text but i am high as a kite üòéüòÇüòÇüòÇyes you can get high from bupe if you got no tolerance i would start with a very low dose like 051mg cause bupe is very strong opioid but yes if you got no tolerance like you have then you can use them recreational because of the dose you should maybe wait for someone who knows bupe better than me i just know from this sub that you can use them to get high too many ppl snort them also to get high idk if the bioavailability is higher if you snort them but yeah as said maybe wait for someone else to give you better direction of dose i know that in my country theee are 02mg and 04mg for pain and many addicts use these pills to get high if they cant get dope also there are 2mg pills and 4mg and for maintenance there are 82mg bupenaloxon like the subutex you got in the usa all the other pills got no naloxon in them so many ppl here shoot them also have fun dude and dont take too muchyeah from the pregabalin i also got bad visions its like if you use too many benzos and black out at least for me it was like that everytimeyeah i know sorry but english isnt my first language i meant by seeing a doctor that he should go to the er and see a doctor there that was what i wanted to say but yeah i probably said it wrong but yeah that shit looks disgusting anyways and i dont get it why op didnt came to the solution on its own that it is necessary to go to the er if my arm would look like that i would be very concerned about it and would go to the er immediatly fuck if op waits much lobger he can lose his arm that shit isnt fun i know 2 people who lost an arm and a leg the guys arm looked very similar to ops one he waited about 5 more days and kept injecting in that arm and missed a few more times and then boom he lost consciousness and wakes up in the ambulance car while driving to the er and they had to take the arm off because otherwise more limbs couldve been getting infected and the guy who lost his leg shot in the same spot for about 2 weeks straight untill he had a really big hole it looked a bit like in requiem for a dream and the hole got bigger and more infectedso badly that he couldnt walk anymore and his whole leg turned blue and black and stank like a 4 week old dead pet and he kept shooting in that leg cause all his veins were already gone cause a month before they already had to cut out a ca 15cm long and 3cm deep part of his leg cause of missed shots and abscesses the guy who lost his arm killed himself 3 weeks after losing his arm he hated life after losing his arm he kept using while he was in hospital and his other arm had 3 abwcesses and the doctors told him to stop iving in that arm cause otherwise they need to take the arm off too and after that message he went outside to smoke a cig and walked in the clinic forest and shot about 2g of dope at once with a extra large syringe he had stolen in the hospital and died there they found him the next morning the dude who lost his leg went to long time rehab for 6 month and was clean for 3 years and then relapsed he is now in the mdone programm and uses dope from time to time but he is only smoking now and since we just have 3 here smoking is a good alternative to shooting dope so op please go to the er immediatly i wish you best of luck and that they can fix your arm fastyeah i am not alone i am living togetheelr with my older brother he tqkes care of me he also savved my life twicw qlready when i oded he is an awesome older brothee and i love him for that he always takes care of me whether i black out or if i od he already aafed my kife once when i stopped breathing for 5 min and once when i lost conscious i qlready told him often that he is the best big brother on this fuvking world at leqst ai dont have the feeling anymore that i need to puke but thanks to you also for caring about me its 3 30am here i will eat now smth and then i will go and sleep a bit lolyou are welcome i just also had to get that off my chest cause i think the amount and strength you guys got pain pills for injuries that could have easily been treated with half the strength and amount of pain pills but i also understand you if i would have been able to get pain pills in that strength for one of my many injuries like broken arm leg etc i would feel the same also because of that fact you guys are feeling pai way different i know that pain is subjective and if you had access to pain pills way easier for decades then the general subjective feeling of pain is way different than in other countries so i really can understand you maybe you can call your doc again and tell him that you are in extreme pain and if he is able to give you a script for a weak opioid like tramadol or norcos hydros 5mg10mg maybe that is working and i also wouldnt ask directly for opioids i would just tell him about your extreme pain cause if you ask for opioids then the red flag pops up in the docs brain did you ask him directly after the surgery for pain pills or did you just waited untill he gave you a acript

while others cant so the ones who can myself included like it those who dont dont i remember reading threads on bluelight and erowid ppl would just rip anyone who liked tramadol as either being noobs or falling for placebo so many flame wars over tramadol lol brought a bunch home from mexico and my nephew whod been snorting opana loved em as wellthe only thing i have to add unfortunately is   worse case scenario all else fails if you come upon the 11th hour and still havent found a new dr  if she gets herself admitted to the hospital somehow before the scrip expires the hospital will provide her meds 247 until shes discharged i know thats pretty drastic and may only buy her a few days but other than suggesting youshe source the black market its all i got question  is she affluent could she come up with 1000 a month or more if it meant continuing to receive her meds  do they plan to taper her off completely or lower her dose or switch to something else   older woman 30 years on

exist the only place they brag about their badassnessno it wasnt u4 apparently its an extremely clean very potent and very euphoric energetic synthetic opioid after reading about it i really want to try it apparently this guy was doing the equivalent of 500 bags of h worth i cant even imagine what those withdrawals felt like just yikesi think the exact same thing every time i see the latest multi billion dollar settlement state x reaches with pharmaceutical company y not that i necessarily agree we need to be rehabilitated or treated  why tf isnt this money funding new rehab clinics why isnt it paying for someones methadone or suboxone scrip rhetorical question of course because they dont actually care about helping anyone and the average citizen isnt going to demand safe clean potent pharmaceutical heroin bc opiates are bad unlike the good drugs like weed cigarettes and alcohol we should be ashamed of ourselves for enjoying the euphoria a good opiate deliversthis thread is great the post that comes to mind was my first time doing any opiate ever and its heroin kid wondered why he was vomiting because you didnt do h you did fent he was told begins arguing   no im sure it wasnt fentanyl if it was id be dead plus it didnt feel like fentanyl  from the kid whod never done an opiate beforeyeah bruh this isnt cw its fetty the days of scoring heroin so pharmacologically pure its snow white are ovah takes a really good h chemist with really good lab equipment precursors tons of opium gum a sophisticated criminal supply chain to transport the final product then you really gotta know people to get yer mitts on it before it gets stepped on by 150 different dirtbags meanwhile a gram of fent costs a few pennies to make in a chinese lab is 100x more potent than even the very best h and can be bought direct by any 15 year old with internet access and a basic understanding of bitcoin  youve been snorting fent not h bruhyeah benzos are already scheduled narcotics and theyre starting to be treated the way opiates are despite being such lifesavers for so many ppl i have acquaintances whove been introverts their entire lives had so much social anxiety they couldnt get a girlfriend or boyfriend then they got on klonipin and it literally changed their lives i know theres a lot of people who love popping em like candy but me personally i never really got it too many just make me feel sluggish but more power to em xannies make my job dealing with customers way easier but im glad i weaned off wd is a bitch and one physical addiction is enough for menah man its still subjective based in the individual i know that for a fact because not only did i get a fantastic high when i was opiate naive it still made me very very happy when i had a heavy oxy habit codeine otoh just yuck hated it and always have it is a precursor for several kick ass opioids tho  i dont understand the pharmacology and dont claim to but perhaps theres nonrespondersrespondersand heavy responders all i know is it works for me and its not placebo id take it over hydrocodone which i think sucks ass any day no question  and the stuff i got from mexico was just insane both my best friend and nephew who had an opana habit at the time got rocked off itwait this stuff is schedule i bro is it legal in china as far as you knownot a dumb question imho from a lay perspective if bth is just poorly processed h perhaps further processing can be done obviously you cant go back to steps that were rusheddone improperly but bth just seems so raw id be surprised if the opiate alkaloids couldnt be further isolated and refined hopefully someone with chemistry knowledge will chime inanother buperenorphine  precip wd misconception that even the most informed among us still have myself included until recently  bupe doesnt cause wd bc of its high binding affinity  reduced intrinsic activity it causes it because its a competitive agonist plus its low intrinsic action at the receptor   if it was the binding affinity alone all kinds of opiates including methadone would cause precipitated wd in anyone addicted to a more powerful opiate like h or fentlol they could just as easily write a lower dose accidentally with that tactic congrats and all but i dont think i could distract my doc into writing oxycontin instead of ibuprofen üòâ  im not gay but im really good at coming off gay have a light lisp and can easily and convincingly seem 100 gay and im reasonably good looking was much better looking before i got into dope but im still a good looking cat who also looks much younger

drug and destroy every relationship you ever had for her your curiosity right now can be life or death  on the other hand i get it and your probally gonna be happy you did it at first because of how great the feeling is especially if you shoot up but its not gonna lead down a nice road i promise but once you taste opiates theres no going back its allways gonna be in the back of your head for lifeagreed it boggles my mind in some ways if it wasnt for heroin i probally would have offed myself in bad times it was the only thing that kept me happy until i could rebuild my life im now 2 years clean but opiates leave a taste that lasts forever your never able to forget that feeling and if things go bad in my life again i cant say for sure i wouldnt relapse thats the price we for dancing with the devilangelyeah those were precipitated withdrawals there like opiate withdrawals but x100  especially since u been on fent for a whole yearsorry i highly disagree and u didnt provide as to who created this opiate epidemic 90 of heroin users started on prescription pills most of them prescribed the evidence is overwhelming im one of those people not to mention the dea completely now is taking the opiates away from legitimate pain patientsits so unfortunate for people like you with legit pain the god dahm pharma conpanies and health clinics got everone hooked on oxy and opiates in early 2000s then decided oh shit we fucked up when any person would realize that opiates arent easy to quit so everybody switched to heroin now the dea is basically forcing any legit pain patient to get screwed and forced to go to the street and get opiates or better yet heroin and then they od or get arrested therefore profiting the jail system and ruining the persons life and wondering how and why the opiate epidemic happened  its all a cycle that must have been plannedlol dude u just brought back mad memories  bavent played since like 07 but even not on opiates i was on that shit for hours it was the only game i actually enjoyed and i never play games if opiates were introduced to me back then forget it i would have played for 12 hrs a day completely content what level are uhave u been doing so for years like only on weekends kind of thing and avoid withdrawal because i started the same way the addict brain allways rationalizes that somehow your different and ignore the impending doom that will happen with opiates could take 1 month or 1 year any opiate addiction ends in a train wreck  ive tried for years to get high successfully and only binge its just completely impossible i was wondering if there really is a successful addict out there that only does on weekends like a glass of wine on sunday dinners heroin is just the perfect feeling thats why i think its impossiblei been clean for 2 years i was denying the fact that people can do opiates occasionally  reread my post its delusional to think heroin can be done occasionally thats what i said trust me ive had plenty of relapses that have proved to me i cannot do heroin recreationallyas ive said im sure your right im just giving my opinion on how it feels for me and others i know i dont know maybe its the dope ive got in my state thats different than yours ive allways got euphoria from china idk what ur saying and also have gotten that itchy feeling off of it too the tar does have a slower come up i agree on that and im sure ur right also about the sea heroin but guys on street today china white is fentanyl thats what they refer to so please dont wanna debate no morewhatever man seriously taking the post way to to serious drugs effect everybody different they do feel extremely similar  its opiates one is stronger witch is fentanyl my buddies have said the same its heroin its a minute difference yes they feel different if u really take notice but to me its dope nothing differentwell dahm ok mr scientist isnt that what i said not saying ur wrong but china white is refered to dope worh fent  tar usally isnt cut with fent so its just heroindude chill out ur having a problem about how heroin feels its an opiate ur complicating it way to much ive done both for over 15 years till i got clean the feeling is extremely similar just one if stronger  nobody knows about the white asian shit ur talking about on the street china is fentanyli agree bro kratom saved my life  drsubs your iggnorant and stupid af have fun with your sub withdrawals  kratom withdrawal isnt even close to how terrible subs are to get off of dr subs came at you like a complete prick hiding behind is computer screen probally an 80 pound toothless weirdo in real life so it boosts his ego  everybody has an opinion kratom is a life saving plant i got blown up in 2010 in kabul  afghanistan and was addicted to opiates for 7 years till i found kratomchina is cut with fent  tar is pure heroin not cut with fent they both feel the same china is stronger though but more dangerous
,,,BB19722,opioid^opiates^opiate^dreams,hey again mate i wish i had answers for you you know my situation youre further down this path than i i certainly hope it doesnt take 700 days d have you considered that maybe this is just a matter of adapting to life without the reward system of opioids its probably not something that will be changed by further repair of your opioid receptors keep at it friendive tried kratom and it is quite useful however its illegal in my country united kingdom and attempts to order it from abroad have been seized in the past either way they stimulate the opioid receptors its all about dosage ive had worse withdrawals from a fairly big kratom habit around 30gday than i have with therapeutic doses of tramadolyeah i dig i do know the ssrisnri effects in fact thats part of the reason ive chosen it whilst the opioid dependency could build up again very fast ssrisnri dependency will take a long time to develop i intend to taper it seems i can maintain on 100mgday as a single xr dose tbh that seems to me an ideal maintenance far better idea than suboxone from my pov esp given that subs make me feel like shiti mean im afraid that kratom is still an opioid ive been on it and withdrawn nothing compared to heroin but still unfortunately im in the uk and it is illegal here all rcs and herbal drugs are illegal here the psychoactive substance act 2017 basically changed the way the law worked rather than having a list of prohibited substances all psychoactive substances are illegal and its the exceptions written into law rather than the outlawed substancesi know you said not to talk you out of anything and it seems your heart is stuck on trying it yet youre already in a position where you crave the opioid high to some extent and already have a taste for oxy the heroin hole isnt something you make the decision one day to crawl down you slowly shift until its too late and youre stuck i thought i was different and could try it just once ok every month as a treat on payday ok once a week cant be that bad well if i just keep it low dose its no different to tramadol or codeine   x200b  that story is probably the same for all of us here were all the smart ones who will get away with the buzz without the fall until were not and youre just another junkieyeah im torn myself shes very straight edge i dont fear her leaving me i fear that i would expose so much broken trust that it would cause a rift that i cant really handle at the moment maybe once this is over and i can truly say im clean and back to my normal self at least 7080 i can say but even then it exposes that ive been lying about why shes had to break her back nursing me i think some things are best kept quiet if they have to the situation where i see myself coming clean would be if i relapse and have to detox again then i know the problem is worse than i thought and i really am a sick puppy and its imperative for her to know until then i think id rather get away from this without the reputation of an ex junkie i really dont think im likely to relapse i have a rather stable life and stable relationships i actually enjoy life i got into this shit as a kid and ive changed a lot since and lost contact with the friends who i would take opiates withi would advise setting yourself a hard limit of what youd ever take in terms of opiates nothing more than dhc tramadol vivo and stick to it and please do try to avoid a habit captain obvious i know but ive just come off the most intense withdrawals ever and they are still presentit is an opioid but yes its very weak relatively speaking if you had a full blown habit it wont work i tried to use the exact same pills to get me through my h detox i would take 1000mg at a time in xr form out of desperation at some points and it did absolutely nothing i started taking them to counteract paws around two weeks after my detox so my tolerance is next to nothing i needed a small amount of opioid to get maintain myself because life with paws is hell especially when you need to interview start a new job and generally bring your a game tramadol is an opioid agonist and an ssrisnri so it provides both antidepressant and opioid effects   x200b  you can get pretty high from tramadol even with a smallmoderate habit if the tablets are instant release which is why ive deliberately put myself on extended release tablets for that i reason they take around 2 hours to properly kick in and i dont feel high however my paws completely clears i spent two weeks cold turkey first though so i think you need to do that before its going to have any significant effect if you have a real habit and yes thats a lot to go through  maybe replace the zofran with a benzodiazepine if the doc would allow it but as i said in another comment some kind of opioid dependency maintenance might make sense here at least temporary to go through a more protracted and tapered withdrawal which will be less likely to produce severe pawsthanks friend ive allowed bins to stack up in my house for two weeks now due to withdrawal this morning i woke up after a decent sleep and just did it effortlessly and i havent redosed this morning i will take just one tonight 100mg over 24 hrs tonight and see how that makes me feel feels very strange being so satiated by such a relatively tiny opioid dose given only two weeks ago it took at least 07g of heroin just to keep me away from withdrawalif she isnt able to handle a ct she wont want to go through a narcan withdrawal its extremely dangerous outside of a controlled environment ive accidentally put myself in precipitated withdrawals the process youre referring to with narcan with suboxone before and it lasted well over a day and the cognitive effects the primary barrier to staying clean were debilitating and i ended up taking a gram of heroin in an hour just to try to get something on my receptors that wasnt suboxone   x200b  so yeah we arent talking one minute were talking hours with potential risk of seizure as far as im aware the only time ive heard it being used as a method of withdrawal was in preliminary controlled trials for extreme cases of addiction in which the subjects were medically comatosed look theres no easy way out of this as i said a taper using heroin is very unlikely to get you anywhere your best options are to move her to a more appropriate maintenance substance or to pull the plug and ct it   for background im currently at day 10 of a detox from an 8 year opiate habit including years worth of heavy heroin use its been hard real hard but im here and im feeling better every day it only takes 45 days to start feeling better and get the confidence that you can live without the junk its really something she ought to consider whats a few days of suffering compared to the risks and downsides of using that shitthat was my experience with previous withdrawals from tramdol kratom codeine etc and shorter morphine binges this is a multiple year long heroin habit though its a different kettle of fish only now am i starting to get relief from spasms stutters inability to talk etc and even then my relief is only in the evening i get a few hours of fever dreams and then wake up feeling like death again   x200b  of course its nothing compared to the hell of the first 34 days that is truly brutal probably the most painful thing ive experienced ct as you probably guessed but theres at least the saving grace on day 5 that you feel noteably less sick then on day 6 and day 7 then day 89 hits and you can feel the rate of recovery slow and you start to feel pretty down how long am i going to feel like this its not helped by knowing that this lasts for months for some im hoping its not much longer than two weeks and im doing all i can to improve recovery but yeah theres more to this than the puking and shittingmany opioid withdrawal symptoms last at least up to two weeks i am on day 9 nearly 10 of my heroin detox and i still feel like a bag of poo poonot to sound like some kind of aa puritan its great if youve managed to drop a serious habit for kratom but kratom is ultimately still an opioid comparable to maintaining yourself on a 100200mgday tramadol habit ime now thats a hell of an accomplishment from when you were before but you are still dependent in my country uk kratom got made illegal and nuked off the streets before you could say but mummy may thats how i get through work and i have read that legislators in various states are gunning for it more evidence is coming out about its opioid effects too and the us are even more puritanical about making sure all opioids remain prescription only   x200b  ive come off kratom before and it was basically fine im currently day 9 from a heroin detox and in comparison it was nothing but it can still be a monkey on your back stay safe my friend

most people are magnesium deficient which causes insane anxiety you can remedy this with a supplement or epsom salt baths amino acid supplementation helps too it gives your body the building blocks for neurotransmitters try tyrosine ltheanine gaba lglutamine inositol taurine and 5htp i take a supplement called neurolink that had all of those in them kava helps as well   prescription drugs help too of course any benzo helps but they‚Äôre a slippery slope clonidine for high blood pressure and muscle spasms i used gabapentin when i kicked suboxone to help me sleep   meditation getting out in nature and being around animals help with anxiety too even taking a walk around the block to get those natural endorphins going again helps if you‚Äôre a meeting sort of person absolutely go   i know there‚Äôs more i‚Äôm forgetting whatever your plan may be whether medically assisted detox or alone don‚Äôt let the pills lie to you this sitehttpsopiateaddictionsupportcomhowtotaperoffsuboxonewhatisthebestway  helped me immensely when i quit suboxone and it‚Äôs tips are relevant with any opioid hope this helps wishing you the best of luck you can do it i say this coming from a fentanyl oxycodone xanax and soma addiction all of which were prescribed to me by a doctor i still slip up but i‚Äôm working on it and it‚Äôs absolutely nothing like it was beforeit‚Äôs such a slippery slope i was prescribed fentanyl patches and oxycodone for break through pain after a very serious car accident that damaged my cervical vertebrae after learning to walk properly again getting through all the different therapies i needed i wanted off so i told my pain management doctor he put me on a really high dosage of suboxone but i didn‚Äôt respond well and was having migraines when i told him this and asked for help concerned that the suboxone wasn‚Äôt good for me he kicked me out of his practice i then had to get the suboxone from my psychiatrist lower dose and i responded well   that was 12 years ago i‚Äôve had problems with opiates ever since due to some major undiagnosed health problems these problems are now being addressed and i use way less than i ever have before i have three days sober and i feel a lot better but drs never called me an addict eitherjust in pain and physically dependent i call bullshit these drugs are in their very nature addictive since becoming dependent while under the care of a dr my relationship with this class of drugs has been changed   while i consider myself an addict with two rounds of suboxone therapy under my belt i never fit in at na or addiction counseling those methods of help were actually more detrimental for me the label of addict is confusing for me as i‚Äôm sure it is for you too my best advice fuck labels they don‚Äôt matter bottom line is that you want to get clean and need support whether you‚Äôre an addict or just ‚Äúphysically dependent ‚Äù they are just names for practically the same bag of misery   there‚Äôs something called smart recovery that i‚Äôve been looking into maybe it could help you too feel free to hmu if you need to talk trust me i get it whether your drug dealer is on the corner or office the outcome of dependency is the same don‚Äôt beat yourself up you have the desire to get well which is the first stepthank you i will happily take that advice i‚Äôve been trying to be kinder to myself on this topic but i‚Äôm still learning what that means exactly i think that going through a suboxone treatment program in the past really messed my head up with this whole thing they had such a cookie cutter program enforced with a lot of black and white thinkingyou‚Äôre either on or off opiates and there‚Äôs no in between or at least that‚Äôs the way it was for me when i went   there‚Äôs a whole other dynamic that comes into play when a couple is trying to clean up together it‚Äôs hard you play off one another but it‚Äôs not a malicious thing it‚Äôs just two addicts being addicts trying to clean up together i can totally relate to your story i hope you and yours are doing well in this journey if you have any advice for me about how you guys are handling it i‚Äôm all ears thank you for commenting super helpfulyw and thank you for taking the time to read it all my shit with pcs can also be incredibly painful and has its own symptoms that are similar to withdrawal so while my use this time around hasn‚Äôt been consistent enough for serious paws i still have insomnia from my adrenal insufficiency it‚Äôs tough to talk about because i feel misunderstood i am on the tbi sub on here where i post about my treatments but under a different username haven‚Äôt posted on there about opiate addiction however i‚Äôm certainly not against doing so i think i‚Äôll take your advice and post on here to see if anyone else has traumatic brain injury or something using the comment you just read idk trying to quit has been incredibly isolating for me so i can‚Äôt tell you how much it means to me that you tried to understand me i really need people to talk to thank youpcs is very complicated but i‚Äôm happy to explain the basics of what‚Äôs up with me and how it happened traumatic brain injury is the cause of pcs pcs is an umbrella term for a shitload of things for me that was organ malfunction and then failure several severe hormonal imbalances vestibular balance inner ear body awareness damage cognitive issues that affect executive functioning impulse control and the ability to pay attention add ocular damage affects depth perception and a shitload of ptsd basically after my accident i wasn‚Äôt the same person i was before impact and i was locked in fight or flight mode through the healing process i‚Äôm slowly regaining my body and brain back to get better i had to go outside of conventional medicine  here‚Äôs how it happened 14 years ago i hydroplaned into a guardrail going 60 mph spun across traffic where another car hit me i then spun back into traffic and stopped in the middle lane with the drivers side facing oncoming traffic when i was taken to the hospital i had a ton of cervical damage and they told me i had two concussions but never said anything further on it i didn‚Äôt know what that was going to mean for my life moving forward i had to learn to walk properly again entered pain management psychiatric care for trauma and had to go through a shit load of different therapies to rebuild myself the concussions were never mentioned again and the psych misdiagnosed me with a ton of mental illnesses that i didn‚Äôt have before the accident i was put on a lot of different psych meds none of which helped me and all of them gave me extremely negative side effects they were constantly switching up my meds it was awful  fast forward to 20162017 and i‚Äôm dying you couldn‚Äôt get me out of the er and doctors were clueless as to what was wrong with me in the summer of 2017 i died in my living room i took a sip from my cup of water choked immediately stopped breathing and turned blue this used to happen a lot before treatmenti‚Äôd choke on stuff and just stop breathing i had no control over it and it was really scary it was about this time that my organs chiefly adrenals and pancreas started shutting down they had been malfunctioning for years  but i didn‚Äôt know it  i was having constant panic attacks and severe gi issues my body was shutting down and no one could figure out why then i heard a podcast about traumatic brain injury and a light bulb went off eventually i found help and started the healing process through functional medicine im in hormone replacement therapy and we are rebuilding my body by giving my it what it needs to heal and replacing what‚Äôs missing pancreatic enzymes and cortisol to name a couple so that my body could function again i still have a lot of work ahead of me before i‚Äôm back to 100 but i‚Äôm well on my way  what all this means is that normal day to day shit is difficult or near impossible to do my brain is healing and rewiring so i get over stimulated really easily shit like grocery stores night clubs or big social gatherings are really tough i‚Äôve had extreme panic attacks from this and it‚Äôs not a choice my brain simply can‚Äôt process all the information properly yet driving long distances over 30 min is impossible for me right now i actually just started being able to drive again without panicking as i heal things need to be familiar and have as little stress as possible or my adrenals will fail on me again my adrenals are about 60 healed at this point there‚Äôs a lot more to it but that‚Äôs a quick overview  i would say a huge part of my recovery is getting my brain back 100 this includes impulse control which is a huge problem with tbi survivors new research has shown that tbi survivors are extremely vulnerable to opioid use disorder oud and i think i‚Äôm certainly one of those people i think that‚Äôs why i never fit in at na but opiates are addictive no matter what brain you have the person i was before i hit my head was cool with drugs but did not have an addictive personality honestly i feel it‚Äôs been a blessing to be able to see shit from this perspective and then heal enough to talk about it not much is known about tbi or pcs because the medical care is still evolving  shit this is long i‚Äôm sorry  i really like your take on recovery you sound very accepting and nonjudgmental which is great being too hard on yourself literally helps no one i don‚Äôt think there is a perfect way to recover because everyone is unique sounds like you‚Äôre doing a kick ass job though i couldn‚Äôt agree with you more about staying positive and grateful our perspective is everything in life and we‚Äôre in control of what that may entail  thank you for asking me that and trying to understand me it‚Äôs been tough to connect with others because my situation is um uniquesure let me explain so after my accident 14 years ago i was at my worst i was in pain management and legally was prescribed fentanyl 75 mcg patches 90 mg of oxycodone 8 mg of xanax and around 1400 mg of soma per day that was just what i was prescribed and would buy additional 30s 80s or h if needed the patches were eventually eaten or chewed on instead of placed on my arm i‚Äôd run out of meds and would have to cop methadone towards the end of the month before my drs appointment i was usually in withdrawal this went on for years and to be honest i can‚Äôt even remember how long exactly this is when i got into my first round of suboxone therapy   i stayed clean from opiates for awhile until my divorce i then picked back up when i could find it i usually stuck with prescription pills because they were predictable and i could trust the quality 30s being my favorite since they started putting that fucking time release in the oxycontin that would gel your nose up my use wasn‚Äôt real consistent until i moved where i am now and found a few solid plugs  2016 i was back on 30s again it was pretty consistent because i used with a coworker who became a friend at that time my use was about 34 30s a day but if i could find more i absolutely did them this is when i entered my second round of suboxone therapy because i knew exactly where i was headed right around this time my health started failing and i was in and out of the er constantly i tapered off the subs bc i felt they were making me sick i didn‚Äôt know i had pcs at the time but my intuition was right because sure as shit opiates are not good for pcstraumatic brain injury survivors and exacerbate symptoms for some reason the suboxone was particularly bad about this for me  after tapering off the subs and entering hormone replacement therapy i started picking back up again due to pain same shit with the 30s and prescription pills but more intensely because i was binging and then taking a few days to clean up i‚Äôve been stuck in that pattern for awhile now and it was starting to get out of hand 45 30s a day was certainly doable but as i got healthier i could use less and be happy less being 13 a day but occasionally more  quitting this time has been the easiest yet and i‚Äôll explain why i‚Äôve been rebuilding my body for over two years you would not believe the amount of fucking bloodwork medical care and therapy nutritional deficiencies were corrected with iv therapy injections diet supplementation and a lot of self care hormone replacement therapy also makes this light years easier a lot of the detox symptoms that people experience are mild for me because of this care and taking breaks between binges i also have 247 access to my dr to help my supplement regimen would make your head spin i live by a series of never ending alarms on my phone to keep me on track with it in addition i can‚Äôt work so i just sit around all day i don‚Äôt feel great but i‚Äôm used to being sick so i don‚Äôt complain i‚Äôm just glad to be alive facing my own mortality gave me a different perspective on shit  functional medicine is where it‚Äôs at we‚Äôve completely rebuilt my gut biome and i supplement with the parts of my gi tract that are fucked up until it heals my pancreas was one of my organs to shut down i‚Äôve basically been completely rebuilt from the ground up and i‚Äôm 37 years old  that being said if i can help you with supplement and nutrition info to help you feel better please let me know this sitehttpsopiateaddictionsupportcomhowtotaperoffsuboxonewhatisthebestway helped me tremendously when i quit suboxone but it‚Äôs applicable for any opiate  sorry so long i hope i answered your question  and thank you for your condolences about my father i appreciate that  edit edited a lot because i forget shit totally understand yes you can start before you stop this is incredibly useful with magnesium minerals and b vitamins which your body keeps a reserve of your body doesn‚Äôt store vitamin c but you can take some if you‚Äôd like i‚Äôd wait to start any adaptogenic herbs like ashwaghanda phosphatidylserine and kava until you need them your hpa axis isn‚Äôt freaking out yet that‚Äôll happen once the opiates start leaving your system and you start withdrawing think of it like this opiates are a downer which keeps you sedated over time your body acclimates to being sedated so when you stop the drugs you go into overdrive that‚Äôs when the adrenal stuff becomes handy  that link i posted for suboxone tapering has a section that talks about supplements that helped me it lists some different stuff than i did but it also talks about dosing vitamin c and dlpa another amino acid called phenylalanine which is a precursor to tyrosine this is just me but i‚Äôd also try to get some benzodiazepines and use sparingly for emergencies unless you‚Äôve got an issue with those too lord knows i used to cbd can be helpful as wellin swoops politics to screw everything up why am i not surprised legalization is a step in the right direction at least the laws can always be reformed however who the hell knows when and if that‚Äôll ever happen   i like that drs can use it instead of opiates though and i wish it were an option when i was in pain management years ago it‚Äôs much less destructive and has helped me through some truly painful times in my life   the way you‚Äôre describing it sounds wonderful i‚Äôve been hesitant in the past because i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs way stronger and has more hallucinogenic properties i‚Äôm healing from two traumatic brain injuries and have done enough hallucinating all on my own which scared the fuck out of me not down for hallucinating again any time soon i‚Äôll see if my guy gets tinctures thank youbrilliant outlook you‚Äôre right thank you i try to stay positive but it can be tough with so much negative going on outside the opiate use sometimes i get lost in it and need to be checked thank you for reminding me of thatopiates are really good at making you feel wimpy for sure please know that you‚Äôre strong it‚Äôs a lot of hard work to be an addict period and you‚Äôre right high price high rewardthere ya go  opiates are really good at making you feel helpless when you‚Äôre not know that you have options on how you want to tackle this all people who have become addicted to anything are strong by nature you included just think of the energy expended on getting a daily fix congratulations on the new gig btwquitting is a total mind fuck for me more than anything else at the moment i‚Äôm not unscathed for sure i know there‚Äôs endorphin and other neurotransmitter problems from them i know the emotional component is being lumped in with the grieving process about my father i think what i meant when i said paws was the standard flu like symptoms i‚Äôm sorry if my post came out like i‚Äôm in denial i don‚Äôt under estimate the drug or what it has done to me nor anyone else for that matter i‚Äôm overwhelmed lately and i guess i needed a place to vent   i know i can stop though within those 14 years i have years of clean time too right now is just really hard once i‚Äôm strong enough cognitive behavioral therapy is on my treatment plan i‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll help and i can‚Äôt wait to go  thank you and you‚Äôre right it is slow but i‚Äôm really lucky my traumatic brain injuries tbi went completely undiagnosed until about two years ago when my organs just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore it took me hearing a podcast on tbi to figure out why i live in a large city in the us and have the best drs but no insurance so you can imagine why it‚Äôs taking so long  and as i‚Äôm sure you know opiates ain‚Äôt cheap so there‚Äôs conflict plus everything got derailed with dad my tbi recovery is a story all by itself which is why i‚Äôm debating a blog i eventually want to write a book   congratulations to your friend stories like that give me hope jesusshot in the head i can‚Äôt imagine i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs okhi when i was tapering and quitting suboxone this sitehttpsopiateaddictionsupportcomhowtotaperoffsuboxonewhatisthebestway helped me a lot it‚Äôs applicable for any opiate really there‚Äôs a section that goes over supplements that‚Äôs pretty good i‚Äôve tried them personally and they saved me a lot of misery don‚Äôt forget to have some imodium ad on hand to help with the stomach stuffoh i totally agree sub detox is waaaayyy worse i had a dr who was a recovered addict and he explained why suboxone wd is worse than regular opiates he told me that suboxone hits all the opioid brain receptors instead of just some with regular opiates so the detox is more intense makes sense it‚Äôs a wicked thing   you doing imodium for stomach upset i‚Äôve read about people taking probiotics during wd but i haven‚Äôt personally so i can‚Äôt speak to it part of feeling so awful is your gi tract being jacked up i think something like 90 of your serotonin is made there   you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre making great progress you got this your positive attitude is awesome and will help get you through thisyw  happy to help take your time with your taper if you can it takes time for the body to adjust every time you lower your dose if you go too fast it‚Äôs essentially the same deal as going cold turkey but drawn out in a perfect world every time you step your dose down you‚Äôd want to stay there until you felt comfortable at it for me this was always incredibly difficultimpossible with my drug of choice   i do have tips for getting on subs  i went on them after my fentanyl and oxy habit don‚Äôt take any until you are in full withdrawal and absolutely can‚Äôt take it anymore if you take suboxone too early it will cause extremely wicked withdrawals when i transitioned to subs i didn‚Äôt wait long enough and i got sick af and you‚Äôve just got to wait that shit out i think i was sick for about a day the naloxone same thing as narcan in subs knocks any opiates you have in your system off of the receptors and then blocks those receptors this is why opiates have little to no effect on people who are on suboxone which helps prevent relapse you typically dose suboxone every 24 hours or at least that‚Äôs how i‚Äôve done it suboxone has a really long half life too so once you‚Äôve taken some you should be good for awhile with the small amount you have you‚Äôre still not going to feel great but hell it‚Äôs something that will take the edge off i hesitate to tell you what mg to use i‚Äôm certainly not a dr  i understand your desire to dig yourself out of your own hole but know that if it gets to be too much you have options not having insurance doesn‚Äôt have to stop you from getting help if you need it a lot of clinics have assistance programs and think of the extra money you‚Äôll have when you stop using the manufacturers of suboxone also used to provide medication assistance which made them super affordable i think they‚Äôve even started doing online suboxone therapy if you google ‚Äúonline doctors for suboxone treatment‚Äù you‚Äôll see some info   make sure your kratom is from a reputable source where it‚Äôs tested for heavy metals and shit like salmonella some of the untested stuff they sell in gas stations has tested positive for stuff like that i‚Äôd go with a red vein variety for detox   i‚Äôll check my messages later today not loving life this morning but thought i‚Äôd respond here at least i hope this was helpful and i‚Äôll talk to you soongreat topic i‚Äôm a woman who has been in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy for over two years i get testosterone and estrogen pellets and take progesterone orally hormones are vitally important to your quality of life my hrt is done through a functional medicine doctor who specializes in balancing hormones i‚Äôm not in hrt because of opiates though but from post concussion syndrome i love hrt it absolutely helped saved my life conventional medicine is just now really starting to understand their importance i had a lot of bad experiences with conventional endocrinologists so i went the functional medicine route best decision evertalking on here has helped and i have my sister who is 20 years sober to lean on opiates are a small part of a bigger issue for me now i‚Äôm not saying that opiates are by any means small they are a huge deali‚Äôm healing from post concussion syndrome pcs and organ failure this condition has already taken my life once back in 2017 right now my focus is on becoming healthy enough to actually live a normal life again part of this includes stopping opiates but i‚Äôm not well enough to attend meetings or therapy yet part of healing from a concussion is attending cognitive behavioral therapy which i‚Äôm really looking forward to doing once i‚Äôm strong enough my opiate use will absolutely be a part of that i‚Äôve tried na and even aa but they were more detrimental than helpful and i tried several different groups in different cities this i did before the organ failure when i was more mobile i‚Äôve had pcs for 14 years but was untreated and misdiagnosed for 12 years until my body simply couldn‚Äôt do it anymore  how about you what has your recovery looked like  by the way just ate lunch and feel a lot better dthank you yeah fentanyl is scary as fuck especially the stuff you find on the streets that‚Äôs coming out of china completely unregulated i used to be prescribed the 75 mcg patches and that shit is no joke glad you made it out congratulations on so much clean time i really admire you for it  you‚Äôre right it is shitty that he did that but he‚Äôs also cleaning up when we were using we‚Äôd say that to each other a lot ‚Äúhey wanna get some pills‚Äù so it‚Äôs not really an unexpected behavior i did get pretty upset about it though which made him immediately drop the subject he is a good man and has supported me through my healing process my medical bills are insanely expensive and he works two jobs to pay them when i died in 2017 he was the one who resuscitated me i can‚Äôt be too upset with him about it opiates are one hell of a thing to kick as you know   thanks for saying that about being able to refuse drugs i needed to hear that this morning i got maybe 3 hours sleep last night and everything aches i know today is going to test me physically and especially mentally with the lack of sleepcongratulations on 10 months damn super similar story for us to both quit have gotten this far by choice and with money in the bank is fucking amazing it‚Äôs like the planets have aligned or something i‚Äôm sure you know how it goes in a couple dynamic you play off of each other it‚Äôs a fucked up and really frustrating i wanted to stop he didn‚Äôt then he‚Äôd want to stop but i didn‚Äôt i‚Äôm just glad we came together and are making it happen feels good  i‚Äôm gonna be totally honest with youif the opiates actually helped my current situation i‚Äôd absolutely still be using but they don‚Äôt they just make everything way worse i‚Äôm tired of stacking misery on top of misery and then getting upset that my life isn‚Äôt what i think it should be agreed this sub is amazing thank you so much for your kind words i really appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏èyw no problem  you nailed it addiction absolutely doesn‚Äôt discriminate and in my experience opiates are the worst i socially used drugs in my 20s but nothing got ahold of me like opiates did i mean i was getting them from a doctorsomeone who by definition is supposed to help me become healthy even went to school got a doctorate held a residency and basically worked their ass off to do so   this speaks volumes about the medical field in general instead of finding the root cause of your pain they throw meds at you i had to leave conventional medicine altogether to end my suffering and find a good functional medicine doctor she dug in and found the root cause and we‚Äôve been working to correct it i feel light years better and am on my way to being 100 pain free   but the mental part still lingers  so imagine if your dr did listen to your claims of being addicted that would mean they would share responsibility in that it doesn‚Äôt look good for them to have to refer patients to a detox program however this doesn‚Äôt make it right if you think it‚Äôs a problem it‚Äôs a problem you know you  it sounds like you‚Äôve got a lot of wonderful stuff going on in your life getting through shit like this is about remembering that perspective is everything and i completely understand the urgency to get off but you‚Äôre in a pretty cool position where you have support you can take your time and you have a child on the way who will benefit from that support that‚Äôs completely awesome breathe and know it‚Äôs a temporary means to an end you‚Äôll get there i have faith in youi completely understand it‚Äôs the stigma that surrounds the word addict that can be difficult to accept everything from just say no in the school systems to the way the media depicts addicts has incorrectly reinforced a negative stereotype a lot of people still believe that it‚Äôs a choice or a flaw in your character that makes you ‚Äúless than‚Äù no one wants to be judged that way or treated differently we‚Äôre all just trying to get through life in the best way we can i‚Äôve found this particularly difficult when you have underlying health issues which we both seem to have most medical professionals don‚Äôt fully understand addiction and i‚Äôve found a lot of doctors are fearful of even getting involved unless they‚Äôre experienced in drug counseling then there‚Äôs the issue of being pigeonholed into a one size fits all recovery program that completely disregards your medical issues the way this country handles addiction is 100 wrong we‚Äôre not criminals   i understand the control thing too please know that it‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs the nature of the drug it‚Äôs tough but it‚Äôs not a definition of who we are as people   i guess i‚Äôve had more time to process all this i‚Äôve been where you‚Äôre at and had to get meds from friends and later drug dealers then it crossed over to leaving drs out completely and using only when in extreme pain i didn‚Äôt want the commitment of a pain clinicthey literally own you while you‚Äôre a patient there it all just felt so dehumanizing to be a number in a system designed to get me ‚Äúdependent‚Äù and then shame me when i needed help quitting funny how you suddenly become an addict when you don‚Äôt follow the rules or want out and i never went off the rails pawning or stealing stuff never dr shopped or tried screwing the system i‚Äôve always had a home and people around me to love and care for pets a career and other responsibilities no criminal record either  forgive me i should‚Äôve led with this congratulations on your pregnancy i can‚Äôt speak to that experience personally but i can tell you that i have a neighbor with three healthy children who was addicted to opiates during her first pregnancy her story is similar to yours drs had her stay on the opiates until she gave birth during the time she was pregnant she slowly tapered down as much as she could comfortably afterwards they switched her to methadone and she was able to leave opiates behind her eldest child is now 4 i see them frequently playing in the neighborhood as a family  sorry so longi hear ya opiates dont give you room to cope or allow you to emotionally mature then something serious happens and it‚Äôs harder to deal   i‚Äôm sure you have a dr guiding you through your sub detox slow and steady always worked best for me i‚Äôve tapered off subs twice and second time i did it too fast because i needed off asap they screw with my balance and give me the spins due to an underlying health issue i wish subs were an option for metotally weird i think when you first start them they help but then the honeymoon phase ends rather quickly and your left chasing the dragon now opiates give me crazy anxiety and just feel awful but i kept taking them and the bullshit that would run through my head when i was high was ridiculous‚Äùfuck my fianc√© i‚Äôm leaving him he‚Äôs such an asshole‚Äù when in reality that man has sacrificed everything for me and is my best friend so stupidi feel you im recovering from cervical injuries and chronic illness you have options when it comes to pain management cbd and medical marijuana help me out quite a bit i also did myokinesthetic therapy which helped immensely to find other options i had to step out of conventional medicine though  your body makes its own painkillers called endorphins when you take opiates your body stops producing them it takes some time after you quit for your body to turn back on and start producing its own endorphins again
,,,depress10n,opiates^auntie,do you really need to try perc 30s is it worth the risks hate to be that guy but opiates are no tip toe  anyway insufflation will always hit better than oral administration because the nasal membrane is very porous and thus allows drugs to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream whereas you generally have to digest something orally administered which usually lessens the effects and increases the onset of action plus you end up swallowing some of the drug that you snort anyway  edit i assume by perc 30s you mean 30 mg oxys percs only go up to 10mg oxy hcl325mg acetaminophen equivalent to 9mg oxy25mg for human is a lot if youve never ingested marijuana and nobody describes cannabutter by the weight of the butter my brother has never taken as much as a perscription drug he took 5mg and didnt feel anything 58 110lbs i started on edibles after quitting for 3 months took 50 mg and felt a moderate high ive accidentally dosed my auntie with 30mg never done drugs and it was hard to tell if she was high  furthermore the whole poisoning thing for animals is still unconfirmed actually as recently as 2016 there were tests for dog thc treatments for anxiety disorders and seizures all of the symptoms of the poisoning are effects humans get when ingesting weed the issue is that they dont know they are ingesting a psychoactive chemical which is the risk you take with any drug you give a dog   thc would be no more dangerous and probably less than whatever opiatesbenzo theyll give the dog at the vet there are eayy more confirmed deaths from adverse anesthesiadog perscription there was one case that reported 2 dogs died after eating thc but it has no sources and doesnt say they died from the thc there are countless videos on youtube showing the effect of a dog ingesting thc

,,,bathcigbomb,opiates^opiate^opium^black,welp i was gonna finally confess to my psychiatrist that i use kratom as a way to stay away from opiates nope not anymoreim so sorry op  i had a pure bred husky that was my best friend for 15 years growing up it was my moms idea to get him but she didnt give a fuuuuuuuck about treating him right i walked him for an hour and a half literally every single day until he was too old to walk i bought him fancy dog food with my own money when i was under 18 and made sure to never feed him table scraps he wasnt allowed upstairs so i slept on the couch next to him my entire childhood he was my world i remember begging my parents to take him to the vet because thats like a normal thing to do when you have a dog right i realize the vet is expensive but my parents would yell at me whenever i asked and he never went i remember buying him tramadol online mild humananimal opiate painkiller because aspirin wasnt enough sometimes i had a job at mcdonalds but it wasnt enough to pay for the vet when he got old my mom suddenly started to care and made such a big deal about how well she was treating him like a month prior to his death and continues to both my dad and my brother have acknowledged that she is full of shit and that i was his real caretaker so that feels validating at least he was the family dog but everyone recognizes that i was his true owner at least she didnt sell him away she would feed him pizza milk and other table scraps he started gaining weight and all my years of walking him felt like it got flushed down the toilet he was old af so it didnt really matter but i was always so pissed when i would find out that she fed him like half a pizza she was helping him evil fucking bitch she accused me of walking him everyday so i could smoke cigarettes i smoked cigs at home all the time anyways and didnt give a fuck if my parents saw me that was bullshit  when it came time to put him down my mom wouldnt allow it he was in so much pain and clearly past his time it was heartbreaking seeing him alive everyday suffering so much my entire family eventually yelled at my mom and we brought him to the vet to be put down he should have been put down like 2 weeks if not a month prior to that though he had super bad arthritis through his entire back and couldnt get out of bed he was clearly miserable so miserable to the point that i knew he needed to be put down which is something i would never want but i knew it was his time which shows how bad he was   sorry for the huge rant i just remembered this as i was writing it whats weird is i dont miss him at all its like his memory has been erased from my brain but im thinking about him now as im writing this and it feels good i should get another dog lol good for you for cutting contact i need to do that people that cant handle taking care of their pets should not have them a husky requires to be walked everyday my mom walked him less than 10 times in 15 years if you cant commit to that get a different fucking breed of dog or dont get one at all i should be posting this from a throwaway but oh well   tldr i had an awesome husky growing upim probably too late but kratom if you can get stronger opiates that would be better but kratom will help a lotyou could probably defs get some opium in thailand ask around ive done legitimate opium smoked on foil and it was really comparable to smoking h or morphine high just a lil weaker the consistency was like shatter hash oil and tasted of poppy seeds i got mine on the dw maybe 5 years ago and it came from spain there was a super cool vendor that used to exist wish they still did anyone telling you opium tastes like flowers is lying if i could get it again in the future i would definitely consume orally its a waste but the duration and ability to dose high makes it worth it wish you luck homiehonestly for the sake of harm reduction and since theyre pressed i would say dont take them because i dont want you oding from bad advice from me   you could try an allergy test with a tiny speck and see what that does but there could still be hotspots somewhere in the pill did it come from a reputable vendor with good reviews if so youre probably safe also etiz isnt going to kill you that easily at worst you will black out for a very long time   im an idiot so if it were me i would just pop the whole thing it looks like a high quality press so its probably dosed somewhat accurately but that still doesnt mean anything   im sorry i dont have concrete advice in the future i reccomend buying powder and making your own solution and dosing volumetrically or buying a premade solution you could try contacting your vendor and seeing what methods they use to mix their etizolambinders it almost looks like one of those presses they make in bulk in china and those are usually legit but still you never know   edit actually if you want to be very safe dissolve the pill in a measured amount maybe 10ml of water actually dont use water etiz isnt water soluble or alcohol and dose a small amt with an oral syringe from there you can judge its potency at least that way the contents will be uniform be safe mi friend

,,,AfricanSuperBaeng,opiate^opiates,methadone has become my favorite opi recently after heroin of course for two reasons  1 unlike suboxone i can actually get a decent buzz from it 2 it costs me barely anything compared to any other opiate if im doing heroin or oxys i probably will have to spend about 100200 a day but methadone only costs me about 1030 for a full day of being highpersonally most opiates are very easy on the tummy for me i rarely get nauseus or vomit on any opiate no matter what dosage so im not sure if im the right person to ask the only opioid i occationaly puke on 1100 chance is subs for some reason so it is at least nicer than buprenorphine   but if you are having problems with nausea and vomiting i recommend that you eat something if you feel the nausea creeping on lying down on my back for a few minutes also helps and antihistamines also help if nothing works the best solution is to go puke and get it over with as it is a surefire way to feel like a reborn manyeah back when i was a opiate noob i used to get a full night of nods and euphoria from just about 051 mg of subutex good times now i just use it occasionally to keep the withdrawals away or to taper off and my dose is usually 8 mg as i dont live in the states ive never had the strips only the pills with and without naloxe i always snort or boof them which i think has far greater bioavailability than doing the sublingually   the bottle on the picture actually contains liquid methadone so its just one dose ive got a few more bottles in my stash ive recently had some 40 mg capsules of methadone though from france they actually were much better than the liquid stuff ive got now even though im taking the exact same dose which is kinda weird since its the same amount of the same chemical as far as i know i dont have any pics of the french capsules but im getting some more next week or so might post a picture thenyeah thats what i mean there is a lot of drug user who do stuff like coke and ecstasy but would never try opiates if they get one of those fent pills and dont test them they will certainly die  some dealers are fucking morons why would you kill your customers hows that good for businesssounds like a killer combo tbh i would probably try it out if i had the chance   my issue is that the average coke user is probably not an avid opiate user as well and without any tolerance or even not even knowing about the fent in the coke they buy sounds a recipe for disaster almost straight up murderyeah i usually stick to just doing opiates i do benzos and stims very rarely compared to my opiate usage i just helped my dboy out with some weed and i got the benzos and amphetamine for free so i figured i might as well go all in for once my opiate tolerance is through the roof so i can handle pretty high doses with some benzos involved but thanks for the warning

,,,drbdub,opioid^opiate^dreams^opiates^chocolate,i personally would not waste the opioid that would be lost in extraction or my time that is just me  if i had an unhealthy liver took other hepatotoxic meds or planned on making this a regular treat i would do a cwe only you know the details   i am not recommending this but even if you took all 15 you would be over the daily max acetaminophen by only 900mg during the peak of my pill addiction there were days when  i was taking 1015 tabs of the 10500mg lortabs 34 times per day  this is a ridiculous amount of acetaminophen and i am lucky me and my liver are alive and kicking today   enjoydepends on several factors the big distinguishing point is if you have already had a cycle of use and withdrawal before   if this is your first period of continuous use  it can take 6 months of daily or almost daily use   if you have already experienced the hell of opiate withdrawalit depends on how far you have progressed in your addiction it takes less and less time of using to experience full blown withdrawals the farther you go and the more episodes of withdrawal you experience   i have been through the ringer with opiate addiction and for me anything over 15 to 2 days and i pay with 710 days of acute opioid withdrawal   hope this helpsfreedom sanity dreams relationships self worth  but if you buy in bulk you can get a deallooks like a histamine reaction not a missed shot or an abscess an abscess takes days to form histamine reaction is a common side effect of opiate use especially iv put some ice on it and take a benadryl you will be fineany opiate can stop withdrawal from any other opiate you just have to take enough if the ‚Äúrescue‚Äù opiate is not as strong as the one you were addicted to  in your case it would take about 360mg to be equal to 150mg of oxy daily keep in mind that every body is different and like someone else said you may have to play around with the dose but should be able to get well enough to function you won‚Äôt get high on codeine  good luckno it doesn‚Äôt it is a full opiate agonist with average binding affinity suboxone is a partial opiate agonist with very strong binding affinity the reasons it causes pwdhmm you might try boofing for maximum bioavailability i wouldn‚Äôt expect much from that dose the starting dose for opiate naive and for just simple pain relief is 15mgif i understood your post correctly you are coming off of subs bupe the active partial agonist opiate has a very long half life the reason why using every 13 days was keeping your body in a steady state of opioid intoxication and making the detox the same as coming off of a daily use habit   paws is real but it isn‚Äôt what you are experiencing paws is kind of like a ‚Äúbrain zap‚Äù that occurs seemingly out of nowhere and tricks your brain and body into being in withdrawal it can be 6 months or even up to 18 after you are done with the acute withdrawal and you are hit with the yawns and cold chills or sudden diarrhea and anxiety etc   it usually is very short lived and decreases in frequency as the weeks go by   what you are experiencing is the long hellish detox from subs it can be 34 weeks of the acute phase with some lessening of symptoms about halfway through just like regular opiate withdrawal only halfway is 2 weeks instead of 2 or 3 days  so no it isn‚Äôt paws but you aren‚Äôt crazyyou are still detoxing hopefully each day will get a little better than the last from here in out   congrats on your progress  keep up the good workha ha  yesused as a filter instead of a wheel filter for anything being injected pills or heroin or any other shitty class of drug that isn‚Äôt opiatesi am not sure exactly what you mean but i am going to take a stab if you take your presses pill and cut it into quarters you have no idea the dose within each quarter pharmaceutical pills are made with consistent active ingredient dosing   this means a 50 mg pill that is cut in half will have two equal 25mg halves a pressed pill that contains 50mg active ingredients could potentially have 0mg in one held and 50mg in the other half   fent presses pills are very dangerous because of these ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù  fent is prone to clumping and not being dispersed equally and is often compared to a chocolate chip how many chocolate chips will be in your next bite  none or enough to send you to your grave  take care and be safejust a histamine reaction common side effect of opiates they cause mast cell de granulation which releases histamine   take some benadryl beforehand if it really bothers you it is nothing to worry about and does not mean you are allergic to the dope   take carethe fatuous attempts to catch a buzz from bupe we all try it  rarely do we succeed  maybe the opiate naive or like tat said the first 12 days of taking it there might be a slight head change  either nothing happens or adverse events are encountered nausea and headache are the two most common it should pass in 152 days do what tat said and i would add taking some ginger products if you have a prescription for promethazine or odansetron that would be the most helpful   hope you feel better soon  good luck on your recovery and from experience just get your mind to believe you will have zero luck at getting high on bupe it will save you frustration and more nauseawell i guess the suboxone blocked all your opiates  7 lortabs a day is not a huge dose by the way people legitimately taking a prescription take that muchyou are welcome   as long as there is enough water to put the opiate into suspensionit shouldn‚Äôt really matter however i would go for a smaller amount of water over a large amount just because it will absorb faster and have less chance of being absorbed by the stool what size syringe are you using

without disability no job  school is a red flag  i wish you the best of luck its not easyive had a l5s1 disc bulge with nerve root impingement for 5 years now theres no way i can do yoga i dont have much rom inversion table helps somewhat been using it for a few months 1st epidural is scheduled for thursday ive been doing physical therapy for 6 months just had an mri and the bulge is still the same size i tried chiropractic care a whopping 600  month from the top rated guy locally on yelp no improvement  i go to pain management where science comes in the form of a pill to battle my pain for me i am eternally grateful life would be very hard to live without this medicine   now i dont know of pain management criminals or businesses really i do know of some sympathetic doctors who  spend years in training applying themselves deep into medical debt giving their 20s to care for pain patients when there are several other lucrative specialty practices and theyre now overburdened by this fake opioid crisis where ignorant ppl say all doctors who are prescribing opioids are criminals and that this medicine is an illicit drug easily accessible research via google can show that most opioid deaths are the result of illegally tampered opioids with fentanyl from china or mexico not pharmaceutical opioids the truth is opioids are the only pain medications that scientifically act on the actual pain receptors themselves on a chemical level  so you actually should probably not go to pain management because these doctors  just want to get you hooked on opioids which have a smaller addiction rate than alcohol pain is just pain and all pain patients should suffer so when your bulge undeniably gets worse like mine has and looks to be permanent now you would be a full on sociopathic drug seeker to even ask for pain medicine so many patients are suffering from physical conditions that dont go away but ofcourse we should all suffer because an opioid is an illicit drug and drugs are bad mkayy it doesnt matter that science has medicine that can relieve pain you should forever stick to tylenol even though tylenol doesnt even come close to chemically relieving pain as opioids on a chemical level and you should be thrown in jail if you ask for pain meds or if a doctor prescribes medicine for pain then jail is a must theyre just trying to get pain patients hooked even though these opioids can very well safely be tapered over 12 months all pain patients should suffer and all pain doctors should be locked up for having the ludicrous idea to use science to relieve pain am i right or am i rightmy dad and brother have recovered from substance abuse problems i have another brother whos addicted to narcotics  x200b  ive been prescribed opiates for surgeries on and off since 2014  i could of asked for refills several times but didnt i recently started pain management a year ago bc the pain got much worse it seems that youre aware of it all so you should be good if you research opioid addiction rates theyre similar to alcohol so its not like youll forsure get addicted just monitor and be honest with yourself and you should be totally fine like many responsible chronic pain patients out therethats why we should vote andrew yang in he intends to legalize opiates like in europe once its legal ppl will be more accepting of it although theres still plenty of ppl who wont legalization will things easierthe problem is i dont know anyone else whos into opiates he knows hes the only  way in the opiates crowd i have no fucking clue who else to ask this dude was with the only h crowd in high school theres not too many ppl who i can ask  ive known this dude heavy nods way slurred speech like long and dragged out when youre on h constant stomach problems cant eat spicy foods  yes im fucking entitled because im fucking disabled at age 27  and im a close friend i believe that makes me entitled in this particular situation im going to be in a goddam wheel chair soon i can barely walk its so obvious the motherfucking pain i go through and a close friend cant even help me out does h completely drain your soul he can ask his dealer or plenty other ppl who does h he literally said sorry nope didnt even try he knows plenty of ppl who may know someone  he can be like ill ask around betch your ass im entitled god motherfucking dammitnah man through all weve been through in life im literally going to be in a wheelchair within the next decade we used to be best friends man and i do still see him time to time when he went to opiates we didnt hang out as much  i have the hips and back of a goddam 70 year old literally limping throughout all my 20s like i have a serious goddam condition and this guy doesnt even try not at all it d be one thing if we were just acquaintenances but weve known each other most of our lives being best friends at one point  hes not obliged but he can at least try to tell me to hit up someone we may knowsocal opioid pain pills works on pain receptors  seriously though ive been limping literally all throughout my 20s and he tells me to just deal with the pain you and i know he has some hooks bitch ass punk needs what he deserves loltheyre pieces of sh thats why they asked im going to switch i wonder if theres a wait when filling a first opioid script at a new pharmacy

,,,CYPROXY,gum,what ive always done and it helps probably 70 of the time is dip smokeless tobacco its a vasoconstrictor like garlic which works too so putting a huge dip right on the gumline in front of the tooth stings like hell for a bit but reduces the swelling like hell and so makes the pain bearable  i put it on and leave it on an hour later or more ill replace it im a nicotine addict so i have a good tolerance for it if you dont have a tolerance then it like most poisons will probably just make you sick but yeah i still have a can in the car somewhere from the last time i had a tooth that made me want to murder people in the moonlight   edit garlic works too chopped up finely and put on the gum but its harder to maintain as it gets everywhere and it burns worse than dip it does reduce swelling though its all about reducing swelling ibuprofen is a must combined with tobacco or something like it should have the pain manageable within a day or so

,,,HookItUpCuuz,chocolate^dreams,you‚Äôre a lucky man if 30mg does anything to you at all i‚Äôm currently consuming about 600mg1g once a week although i‚Äôve cut down on my regular usage to about 300mg a day i was using about 300450mg once again up to 600mg pretty often although i have a huge tolerance and never really got noticeable effects from it i don‚Äôt understand why i still consume it if it doesn‚Äôt really do anything for me   on the other hand i wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about consuming smaller amounts of chocolate as a delicacy as your mind would probably play the placebo affect on you before you actually received significant amounts of any chemical to give you psychoactive effects at least with how it seems you‚Äôre thought process is and how worried you seem i bet you it will be more placebo than anythingi highly doubt chocolate has enough caffeine to trigger psychoactive effects in somebody who has been addicted for 25 years i‚Äôd guessimate it‚Äôs about 530mg max you‚Äôd have to consume large amounts of chocolate to get any noticeable amount of stimulants from itdon‚Äôt get me wrong i‚Äôve read some absolute nonsense on this subreddit before but what you just said is sometimes what i think about not including infinite other theories i thought about but i also think that‚Äôs part of the key is realizing that potentially all these infinite possibilities exist for yourself and your own universe but you have to master your ego for it to come true  but it doesn‚Äôt play out the way you think it will you have to truly and ultimately chase your deepest fantasy although it plays out oddly i think i understand why most single objects in the universe are spherical based upon gravity like planets and stars for example is because no matter what way it‚Äôs observed there‚Äôs always a point directly on the other side of the sphere to the first point but inside the sphere there is infinite degrees of direction you can travel to reach the second point this to me simply implies that life itself as you live it has infinite degrees of direction and birth is the first point and death is the second point both points are like a negative a opposite and have a some kind of five dimensional geometrical graphing of some sort to pinpoint wherever around the outside of the sphere mastering the ego completely which most humans are not consciously aware of is where you can achieve full movement inside your own universe although you can‚Äôt break scientific law and you can‚Äôt ever seem to escape the moment eventually feeling like that makes time come to a halt as you reevaluate everything that ever was is and will be a infinite times over you just can never seem to find the final key that unlocks the longest path to the second point you might even have the option to never reach it if you don‚Äôt want to which would mean achieving some kind of immortality but i believe that would trigger something inside the sphere or just simply wouldn‚Äôt be allowed by whatever law governs it that is yet to be discovered this also implies because everything relatively is spherical in shape the bigger and smaller we get that the universe is a never ending sphere of some sorts i feel like   if everything is a never ending sphere it just means everything is reused and recycled into another form all throughout time this meaning our pure consciousness as well but once you are fully conscious and have mastered your ego you will realize there is no point because you are the point this whole time only to forget why you became the point you exist at this point until you realize that everything is indeed infinite and while you will never find the last key as those are infinite too there are infinite paths to take only bound to the scientific laws we‚Äôre aware of also bound by things we are unaware of which i think birth death and potentially dmt shows us all dreams and fantasies of which are theoretically possible if a malicious group doesn‚Äôt kill you off once you gather too many keys kind of like a real life rpg with bosses and shit but where your stats are like ego luck etc dmt gives you the answer to who what where when how about yourself but you will never figure out the why which is infinity now because everything inside the sphere can be mapped not only three dimensionally but fourth dimensionally by time the outside of the sphere that brief glimpse of our conscience reaching that point of finally getting a peak of what‚Äôs on the otherside that very brief moment between death and your new life you realize you are the sphere only to have your conscience recycled into another living being because remember we live and die continuously inside this sphere therefore we are aware of the dimension of time as well as volume width and height or 3 dimensional space it gives rise to a notion that we are governed by a creator of some sorts which exists multiple dimensions above what we can perceive as humans and is effectively what we call infinity   the real twist in this is that once you realize that you are the sphere you realize that any dream you could possibly want could come true but so can your nightmares i‚Äôm a firm believer in mastering the ego which in theory should allow you to walk your path desired as long as you obey the rules predictable situations still have predictable outcomes you can‚Äôt play god or try to by any number of infinite ways god has the first key the last key and all the keys in between as he placed them there for you on your quest but remember there are infinite keys so while you can keep collecting keys you will never find the last one or the why infinity is nothing but a infinite ladder of up or down as we choose to climb or descend you can go as fast as you‚Äôd like in either direction and i believe dmt to have shown me that  i believe dmt creates such a certain chemical ripple in our brains that turns off or blocks out all sensory information from the five senses if you take a high enough dose to achieve a breakthrough experience doing so causing us to rely on our only perception of existence left our absolute raw conscience the point that self realizes it‚Äôs the entire sphere complete loss of ego   eventually most realize we will never have the answers to that which has been purposely placed out of reach but just remember after all my rambling nonsense when you are shown the doors after collecting enough keys the right thing to do is still knock first afterall it was never your sphere to begin withwell one hersheys dark chocolate bar has about 25mg of caffeine in it so i suppose it just depends on the type of chocolate more specifically i would do your research on the caffeine and other stimulant content and potentially consume chocolate with minimal contents of stimulants   my best bet if the negative side effects of caffeine consumption even in low amounts that you experience are enticing you to correct them with a benzo i would just avoid caffeine at all costs then that seems the most logical step again you try to figure out how to avoid effects of caffeine through enzyme inhibition but that seems like a challenging task but best of luck
,,,NodZilla69,opiate,ive been an iv fentanyl user for 4 years here in rhode island fentanyl completely replaced heroin a year before i started opiates so its all ive known instead of the usual person who does heroin if you have no opiate tolerance then basically its a nice rush that goes up your spine and neck then its really deep nods you could spend an hour in one spot and think it was only a minute with no tolerance its honestly like periodic anesthesia and narcolepsy if you have a tolerance then its just like a quicker version of heroin like if you compressed a heroin high from 8 hours into 2

,,,kdmcr,opiate^opiates,i think it‚Äôs because certain strains can give an opiate like effect but from what i‚Äôve read there‚Äôs a chemical in there that attaches to opioid receptors so the strains with more of this chemical would give you more of an opiate effect which is why i think so many people bring it up here because when you google it it does say it‚Äôs similar to an opiate i also think it depends on the question i‚Äôm trying to quit opiates so i posted a question asking how many g of kratom would equal 30mg of oxy which i don‚Äôt think rkratom would be able to help with much but i think just specifically kratom questions should be asked there but just know when people recommend it they probably have good intentions i personally don‚Äôt recommend it to people bc i don‚Äôt have a ton of experience with it i‚Äôve only tried it a handful of times to wave off withdrawal symptoms and i did find that it helped me with that at the very least yeah in my head it sounded like a good idea at first lol now i just miss opiates i dislike benzo highs so i know i won‚Äôt abuse them i just can‚Äôt afford oxy but i have one m30 left and i‚Äôm just gonna try and score some heroin because my oxy plugs uncle sells and he gives it to him really cheap and he tests all his stuff or so i‚Äôm told still can‚Äôt be 100 sure it‚Äôs tested i was just trying to avoid going down the heroin hole since i can‚Äôt afford oxy anymore by attempting to take benzos since i could get em prescribed easy o wellyeah i think i might know a few people who sell xans i gotta start asking them bc i hate being confused on what i‚Äôm taking he‚Äôs great for opiates benzos not so much thank you for your help loveif it helps you kinda picture my sensitivity i‚Äôm an avg sized female and 075 mg of xanax gets me pretty high but i‚Äôve only done it like 45 times and i only took the diazepam 5mg once when i first picked up the prescription  and i didn‚Äôt feel high just took away my anxiety but i haven‚Äôt touched it since then which was a few days ago i‚Äôm more of an opiate gal than a benzo gal i was just hoping to make my oxy last longer and i figured since i have the diazepam it‚Äôs worth atleast trying but i do find that benzos make me sleepy i did end up taking the diazepam 35minutes ago and i still feel good i‚Äôm starting to feel a little drowsy but i don‚Äôt have to be at work for 25 hours so i‚Äôm hoping any drowsiness will wear off by then plus since my job is fast paced once i get going it‚Äôs usually easy for me to combat any nodding or drowsinessyeah i actually used xanax one time when i didn‚Äôt have enough money for oxy and felt great off of 075mg it was a refreshing change but i guess my heart will always be with opiates as long as i can afford them but i‚Äôm lucky as an average sized female it doesn‚Äôt take me much to get the feeling i‚Äôm looking for and my tolerance hasn‚Äôt raised much so i‚Äôm lucky i can afford oxy for now  i just took some of the diazepam about 10 minutes ago so i‚Äôll update on how i feel  hopefully it goes well then i‚Äôll be happy my psychiatrist prescribed me these lol i‚Äôve had the prescription for a few days and haven‚Äôt even touched it it was given for anxiety  and thank you again for your advice and sharing your experiencei‚Äôm only really knowledgable on oxycodone because that‚Äôs what i use but if you go to ropiates and go to the menu section at the top click that and scroll down to where it says ‚Äúfactsheets‚Äù you can search any drug there not just opiates and it will give you doses for light common and strong effects so say you have no tolerance start with the lightest dose and go from there it also shows the effects it will give you and how long it will last as well as the bioavailability of each roa and how fast it should kick in  it‚Äôs been super helpful for me for dosing especially when i first started taking oxy and i recommend it 100 for harm reduction i‚Äôm not sure if suboxone is on there because i haven‚Äôt searched for it on there but it‚Äôs definitely worth looking in to whenever trying a new drug it‚Äôs been my go to they have pretty much everything on there so it should be there hope that helpsüíúright that‚Äôs why i thought there was something wrong with me lool my first time taking xans was my moms prescription they‚Äôre the peach ones and i took 075 and felt great so when i popped 3 of these it confused me because it felt just like when i took 075 of my moms and that was only my second time ever taking xans because i‚Äôm more of an opiate person  i mean atleast my guy doesn‚Äôt lie and say they‚Äôre 2mg even if they are fakes atleast he says they‚Äôre 025üòÇi wish i had more i would‚Äôve sent a pic to u but i took them all already but maybe i‚Äôll cop one pill tonight cause i‚Äôm gonna see him anyways for some opiates and send it to see what ya think

,,,throwawaybcuzdrugz,opiates^opioid,when i was 15 my parents went to italy for 3 weeks my older brother was staying over to watch me but he knew i‚Äôd be fine by myself so he went to a friends up the street for the night i got bored and wanted to get high or drunk i had already dabbled a good amount in the fine art of mary jane  my parents locked up the booze cause they expected my brother to have a party or something i went to my parents room to see if my parents had anything interesting like benadryl dxm or whatever would make me tired yep i wanted to get tired and sleep i was that bored opened a drawer and found a plethora of pill bottles looked through em mainly just antibiotics but there were another 2 bottles  one of those two bottles had 19 5300 hydrocodone the other 4 10 mg diazepam i took 8 of the hydrocodone and started googling if they were any good i soon realized i had stuck gold snorted 4 of em took 2 heaven yea ik it was dumb to snort the hydros lmfao but god damn i was so mind numbingly calm i felt like my freshman crush had just hugged me  i spent that night playing xbox and listening to peep till 7 am i have no idea how i didn‚Äôt pass out knowing 15 year old me i probably had a few energy drinks tried beating off cause ya know 15 year old home alone and high why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt i to no avail  other activities of that night consisted of a 45 minute hot shower an entire season of bojack horseman and facetimeing the girl i would literally move to fucking canada for if she didn‚Äôt feel guilty for cheating on her boyfriend with me and un adding me on snap   so yea that‚Äôs the first time i tried opiates high on hydros rn as i type this i miss that fucking girl so much dude i fucking miss her from the sound of it you probably have no tolerance 1950 mg of acetaminophen is just about half of the max daily dose so you‚Äôre good there 30 would probably be a bit much for someone who‚Äôs opioid naive if i were you i‚Äôd take 34 depending on your weight and take the other 2 later in the night until you hit a good spotwell on it‚Äôs own it‚Äôs pretty much just good for knocking yourself out makes you tired af but it‚Äôs also good por potentiating opiates

,,,Lifelovingattitude,opioid^dreams^black,id say more that it is the efforts to come to orgasm like foretaste of it high dopamine later upon release la petite mort huge endorphin rush is released with the feeling of emptiness like the cycle ‚Äî high dopamine triggers foretaste of pleasure  endorphin release ejaculation  high prolactinlow testosterone socalled apathy numbness after orgasm repeat so technically all this addiction is a blend of stimulant low motivation apathy etc and opioid troubles with sleep for instance resemble the opioid withdrawal addictions and i know what am i talking about because i was in those addictions and yeah the title is correct entirelyyou know apart from caffeine there are lots of drugs that weakens rem cycle alcohol other psychostimulants for instance i remember when i used amphetamines i rarely had even dreams with caffeine the same thing hypnotics also tend to help with going to sleep though the quality of sleep still not the best also problems with sleep can be additionally caused by lack of serotonin because melatonin is made from serotonin i assume caffeine is only a part of the problem hypothetically and it can mess with serotonin levels also you know ideally it may seem that quitting all drugs can return person to feel normal caffeine can also maintain that pstd status quo like overthinking and overliving the same cycles we can even suppose that ocd can be also caused by unending stress and lack of sleep some even state that ocd can be an issue caused by lack of serotonin  x200b  i think the other question is what rem phase is needed for i mean in the stance of pstd nightmares like solving that riddle in the form of disease via rem sleep phase my friend who works in psychotherapy once said that his colleagues and teachers saw how people patients overcame their issues just with sleep and you know whats interesting that todays world work almost without any sleep 247 is it some kind of coincidence rhetorically speaking here also i remember decartes quote about the pineal gland that it is the seat of the soul pineal is linked to producing of melatonin like interesting chain is here lack of sleep  lowlack of melatonin   low serotonin  soul  pineal gland  pstdocd  nightmares  caffeine  rem cycle it can be that a person is drowned in his disease purposefully and you know i sometimes struggle with anxiety and sometimes it detaches myself from what i have to do this anxiety can inhibit growth like continue some vicious cycle of doing the same things experiencing the same emotional states living again the same traumatic events that were in the past and logically now dont serve any purpose at all the past is no longer here it was somewhere far away and it cant be changed like being in the present living the past cycles i dont know how to describe it other way though the only way it can be checked ‚Äî is to try to live caffeine free if ill effects go away the riddle will be solved thats why decafhavent seen movie so dont know you know from my experiences i can assuredly say that the best heroin use is on stimulants comedowns it is even better than benzo dont burn me im not heretic lol overdose is an intense feeling fucked up like weak ties with reality falling into unconscious i once went with my mom to bank and i was extremely high on it and she saw me smashed on the seat waiting for her she was horrified about seeing me smashed though heroin is the best physical high apart from sex from opioids as for me the most interesting is tramadol i like it because of serotonergic activity i once was too high on it and wanted to go to sleep laid on the couch and found out like those dreams were extremely vivid though i wasnt sleeping like to dream without dreaming in retrospective i can say that tramadol is the best opioid as for me because it is unique in some sense dont know maybe there are something new ones that were invented speaking about psychedelics ‚Äî i think after all those binges on stimulants opioids even weed psychedelics ‚Äî are the next logical step like maturiation in some sense another level of pleasure and entertainmenti think everything has its place i assume it can be possible substance or any other abuse is connected with some kind of a problem in my stance caffeine only enhanced my fears though it made me possible to see them i think its a tricky line between what a person really needs and abuse for instance alcohol abuse can have some problem inside in the person who drinks alcohol i used to drink alcohol just for getting rid of tension in me and soothing me and you know i drank alcohol with people that had nothing with me and i thought they were friends though we only drank alcohol like brothers in distress sometimes substance abuse is a mask of some problem sometimes it is some kind of easiness of a problem like in opioid addicts about traumas i can say that trauma has meaning in the lives of people without them there is no learning even birth of a baby is a traumatic event sometimes other people with even harsh traumas can make others feel bad though understanding that others can suffer more gives some temporal relief im not speaking about developing stockholm syndrome no as for me even harsh events in life have some meaning to learn something and probably share with others i assume also overcoming some traumas and doing the other way with a persons children ‚Äî is a key to success like youve seen how children should not be treated now you can show how it should be done with knowing how it doesnt work i believe people should do impossible things because without impossibilities there would be no miraclesyeah thanks for your reply man i just want to understand what ive done wrong that really isnt working to go further with caffeine yeah like im coming to conclusion that there is no need in it if caffeine the thing that holds me back and it is quite possible because fightorflight response which is a prolonged b body wants to maintain homeostasis due to wish to get rid of anxiety thats why relapse can be an option because it is an opioid relief so probably the stress was a main factor i assume though it amazes me how caffeine can intensify all the inner problems fears tendencies etc etc you know from some perspective caffeine just shows the weak points of a person especially fears though im not entirely sure about the fact whether these problems already were in the person or just it is some kind of a delusion caused by caffeineyou know ive made kombucha using coffee instead of black tea and it seems like it doesnt give me the same jitters as a cup of coffee i havent digged too deep but some sources state that during brewing of kombucha caffeine content decreases im not sure entirely thoughi said in my other posts that porn and masturbation were just a coping mechanism with my stress feeling lonely traumas and some partial parents neglect porn just was a temporary pill that doesnt work anymore like an opioid medication that couldnt give anymore pain relief  i agree with all the things youve said absolutely nofap is just a way of life with later creating new healthy habits in order to understand what am i who am i what i like etc etc a heros journey thing thats why keeping diary and writing down everything a person feels experiences changes heshe can see ‚Äî is a step towards maturing nofap is like some kind of psychotherapy with some introspection like you were in hell now find your way through purgatory to eden metaphorically speaking  good luck you too

,,,yabbadabbaduded,opiates,a couple of things  one since you mentioned benzos and passing from my understanding benzos clear your system super fast so its not too difficult to get those through and out of your system ive also read before that a few benzos including lorazepam can sometimes be undetectable period that may have changed though thats just what i read from a few different sources at some point in the past so theyre not a great reference to go by  secondly do you know what type of test youre taking that can make a huge difference in whats detectable there are standard udts the cheapest and most basic which will only verify what is in your system and will only indicate the presence of certain drugs and these types of test have a higher cutoff rate as to how much of the drug is in your system to result in being positive that test type is different than the other types of urine screening like a mass spectometry test this test type has a much lower cutoff amount as far as looking to see what is in your system so whereas a standard udt may only test positive for say oxycodone when a level of 50 is present a mass spectometry test may test positive if a level of 30 or above is present these are just numbers for illustration i dont actually know the actual levels used for oxycodone for the two does that make sense though that each test has different levels that make presence of a certain drug a positive or not basically a mass spectometry test is much more sensitive than a standard urine screen and will make you test positive for something that you may not test positive for on a standard udt not only that but a mass spectometry test does more than just verify that a drug is present  it actually can show roughly how much youve taken and when by measuring the active metabolites to the inactive metabolites   the other thing to note is that the cutoff levels for any type of drug is different so never base your estimated detection time off of another drug particularly when theyre in different classes for example as i mentioned above benzos generally clear the system way faster than opiates do our bodies also eliminate drugs in different ways for example my understanding is that an amphetamine like adderall actually leaves the body through urine and isnt stored in fat whereas marijuana gets stored in body fat and therefore stays in the body longer   you really need to know what type of drug test youre taking to figure out your detection time if its an old fashioned cheaper urine drug test that is just checking for the presence of s drug and thus has a lower threshold as far as metabolites hanging around that will result in a positive then 34 days for oxycodone is what ive seen as the detection time however from what ive been looking at and been told its more like 5 to 7 days for a mass spectometry test to show the presence of oxycodone because that test type is wayyyy more sensitive   id recommend drinking a ton of water from now to whenever your test is just remember to take some vitamin b i believe thats the vitamin to take for this too and do so especially right before the rest so that your urine doesnt look too  clear and therefore cause them to think youre trying to dilute your urine for some reason as the vitamin apparently will darken your urine to a normal yellow even though youve been drinking tons of water   and dont forget that when calculating your half lives that the clock is basically started at the time of your last dose so youll want to go by your last dose regardless of how much smaller or bigger its been compared to ones right before it because if you test positive for it its going to also show the active to inactive metabolites  the inactive metabolites being indicators of doses youve taken that are older and stoll hanging around vs active metabolites which will indicate the more recent doses youve taken   let me know how it goes would be interested in hearing your results especially if its a mass spectometry test   out of curiosity how much oxycodone did you take at your last dose and when is your drug test from that point for example was your last dose taken on a friday at noon how much did you take then and is your drug test the next wednesday   hope this helps ive been looking into this myself a lot lately because i also have a drug test coming up a little over a week from now and have been trying to find out about oxycodone and mass spectometry tests and also of taking a drug regularly effects detection level this is all based off of my recent research so there are likely some terminology mistakes in this and its missing some suoer exact info and maybe worded terribly but im trting to simplify it and just sharing what my understanding of it is im confident someone else can explain it all better but i hope it helps or points you in the right direction of where to further research

,,,throwawayopiates9876,opiate^opium,i got a blood test after 10 years of opiate use and my liver was judged to be fine ive also known other heavy pill users who miraculously turned out to have done no damage to themselves after years of abuse   i suspect youre fine to be honest just be sure to taper down eat healthy get exercise drink plenty of water  all the basic stuff   your body adapts to paracetamol over time so a firsttime user who pops 8 pills would probably be more at risk than you who built up your usage over time   ive seen alcohol destroy more livers than paracetamol dont worry too muchall opiates will fuck with your vision eventually light sensitivity is common theres even a passage in some ancient greek text from 2500 years ago about opium users having bad eyesight particularly sensitivity to light and worsened night visioni could direct you to some useful videos if you want to see where i got these ideas from   im in the process of learning about it myself right now but ever since i had these realizations ive started to understand and deal with things better anxiety is basically gone anger has been significantly reduced   theres a meme around here that says something like opiates are the fastest way to god and its right   its right because you need to be in a truly desperate fucked up situation like opiate withdrawal to even be humble enough to look up at the ceiling and ask an invisible person for help but its also in those situations that you find that invisible person   from a strictly psychological perspective thats because opposites highlight each other like its only when youre thirsty that you truly appreciate water its only when its dark that you start to appreciate light   and sometimes it takes going to hell before you get the idea that its opposite must be possible when you do realize this suddenly your life has a new permanent purpose and meaning      btw my inbox is open if you want to chat or whatever
,,,mmjarec,opiate^opiates,afraid of the over hyped opiate crisis this is your chance to put a dent in it if you think both are bad anyone with experience with both will tell you weed is the least bad option it helps with everything related to opiates withdrawls cravings amount consumedactually just a week ago my pain management doctor who is supposed to be a pro in opiates told me the dentist should have given me three days of hydrocodone nobody is on the same page that‚Äôs the problemyeah and their parents have the balls to blame the people taking them responsibly and their prescribers instead of their idiot child who took a mega dose with no tolerance  it‚Äôs not an opiate epidemic never has been it‚Äôs an epidemic of stupidityand that clearly isn‚Äôt working   fentanyl use and deaths have skyrocketed why others have gone down the whole scheduling system is a joke they put tramadol which is synthetic and has a complete different method of action than regular opiates from poppies it‚Äôs so arbitrary it‚Äôs horse shit look where they have weed as well as mdma both which have huge benefits for psychological therapy of ptsd and others it makes no sense for pharmacies to refuse to fill scripts for old ladies that aren‚Äôt abusing them just look at walgreens getting sued for human rights violations this shit has gone overboardoh well i‚Äôm glad you provided factual info sorry i usually take things the wrong way i‚Äôm so used to being lectured about why i‚Äôm wrong most of the time about opiates a good pharmacist goes a long way but i‚Äôve rarely seen one actually not slack off one way or another usually it‚Äôs not checking something they should and then giving me wrong info or blaming others when i know they can fill on day 29 unless specified by a doctor the problem is you can‚Äôt even find walgreens narcotics refill policy and even the state specific policies don‚Äôt mention refill days at least i can‚Äôt find anything but how scripts can be transmitted and that kind of thingdifferent road for us all but the theory behind the meme holds true starts off innocent and fun then at some point you can‚Äôt function without them   read the er guidelines for opiate prescribe they are supposed to prescribe no more than 30 hydros for a shattered limb fucking insane federal horse shit
,,,Pettyshopstories,opiate^black,haha for sure my friend  i can tell you know your shit as well always a pleasure to meet someone well versed in pharms   yeah detoxing off opana is not on my list of things to do ever lol the worst opiate detox i had was from methadone i titrated from 70mg to 40mg and then just stopped showing up to the clinic yep i was that naive young and dumb lol a week later it hit like a train going 200mph all at once nausea dysphoria the usualbut the sense of lethargytiredness and the bone aches were out of control i ended up using kratom and successfully used it to get through the rest of the wds it took away about 7075 of the wd feelings   opana seems like it would be even worse as its literally the most potent pharmaceutical form of oxycodone on the market besides laudnum but ive never met anyone before whose even tried it   years ago i had a huge addiction to 10mg percocet 75mg endocet and 475mg percodan with the odd nucynta 100mg and darvocet n100 thrown in i was using 70120mg of oxycodone tons of apap no idea how my liver still works every other day or every day when i could  i had a very close friend with a 10mg percocet script and lived with my best friend whose grandma is an opiate addict and had huge scripts of soma 350mg she literally got fuckin 500 of those a month percocet 10mg325mg apap5mg325mg apap norco 10mg325mg apap oxycontin 10mg darvocet n100 100mg propoxyphene napsylate650mg apap such a weird drug and others im forgetting  the withdrawal from just the oxycodone and apap was so badthats actually when i started using harder opiates like oxycontin 80mgroxicet 40mg so that i didnt feel the wd from just plain old low dose oxycodoneapap   if you dont mind me asking how did you get opana the dealer i knew that sold it had fatal aids do you have chronic pain   second question  have you tried any form of darvocet and if so do you remember itenjoy the high i used to like those better than codeine but that 650mg apap was a literal killer and i either got high or felt nothing  i always wanted to try darvon which is proproxyphene hydrochloride in 65mg and 100mg dose capsules and no apap the hydroxhloride version is stronger than the napsylate version and ive heard they were awesome from my grandparents who used to know people that slammed it drug abuse runs strong in our family but luckily none of us got hooked on the needle  im super curious about your answers to my questions hit me back when you can thanks and much love brotherthank you for listening it means alot to me thank you   i went through a big opiate phase in my late teensearly 20s and opanaoxymorphone was the holy grail back then i preferred it over 80mg oxycontins  one 40mg er opana would have me going man what was the wd like from opana i wouldnt want to go through that sounds painful as all hell the oxy ordeal is what got me hooked on fucking suboxone of course   im not an md but im definitely an extremely qualified street pharmacist the nurses pdr which lists every prescription drug on the market each pills dosing side effects brand names what schedule its in for instance all barbiturates are cii except for fioricet which has 50mg butalbital per tablet and is a ciii and oddly enough phenobarbital is a  civ like benzodiazepines basically everything a doctor would know about rx compounds and meds it was my bible i read it everyday to the point that i have it basically memorized   klonopin brand name for clonazepam has up to a 60 hour half life long half life i think only valium and librium are longer 90 protein binding meaning it binds extremely well physically 90 ba which is extremely high babioavailability so how much gets in your bloodstream and its effect or high lasts 612 hours its one of if not the most potent benzodiazepine available in the us all of this sounds scary but clonazepam is one of the most reliable and safe benzos an example of an unsafe benzo is halciontriazolam its got a 6 hour half life works orally after about 5 minutes and can cause hallucinations and obliteration for those without benzo experiencetolerance and has tons of side effects like forgetting where you are or who your mom is lol   you are on a low and safe dose 5 or 1mg is low and appropriate as opposed to the idiot who gave me 6mg klonopin  day and 400mg phenobarbital daily   what you need to remember is that klonopin builds up in your system this is a good and a bad thing its good because like you said if you run out you wont feel sick until day 4 or 5 but this is only if you take it on a regular basis since youve been on it for a year or years and take it semi frequently your in a good position where you have a tiny theraputic amount in your system based of what your telling me i know you wouldnt seize out and i bet the worst of it would be heightened anxiety maybe insomnia and some panic attacks  i have a suggestion that will answer your question stop taking your klonopin asap and see how long it takes before you feel ill if youre lucky you may have very mild wds or possibly not have any symptoms at all as i mentioned above  this means you arent hardcore physically addicted meaning you can continue using it as needed and wont need to worry about seizures or having withdrawals  however to be honest klonopin binds so tightly to your gaba b  think about that protein binding i talked about above and the strong 90 bioavailability  that i honestly think youd need to taper slowly at home or spend a short amount of time probably 6 days to 15 weeks depending on how you handle wds in an inpatient detox if you wanted completely off   however i am 100 sure that you could easily get completely off of it if you wanted to without a huge hassle i think you could do it at home by titrating your regular dose slowly to zero   it would look like this  taking your normal 5 or 1mg daily start as low as you can comfortably 2 days of normal doses then cut a 14 off the 1mg pill and continue with that lowered dose for 23 more days and then cut a 14 of the pill again etc etc until youre taking a 14 of a 5mg klonopin for as long as you need to be comfortable and then just stop   personally id do an inpatient detox bc theyre like a vacation  you just chill on a unit while they detox you you attend aana and watch tons of tv and sometimes make some really good friends or even better have casual sex  im happily engaged and have been for 6 months now and wouldnt change it for anything but when i was single i smashed at every detox rehab and sober living i went too its easier when your gay lol   bottom line youre at a low risk and could easily titrate off over 2 weeks at home if you have will power and you seem like you dosorry my phone died before i could edit this you hit the nail on the head man tekken is too intense now imo especially with the constant de ranking in fact imo the ranking system in t7 is absolute shit the blue ranks are hell until youre out of them no one likes to be demoted and since everyone is everyone is pissy most of the time besides the gods of tekken like lil majin victim of ritual knee etc  youre also 100 correct about the emotion part as well even though its cringy as hell i have an emotional attachment to nina as a character i actually did martial arts because of how cool her throws and moves were and now have a black belt 1st dan in hapkido did it 11 years every other day and am well versed in aikido  i also identify with her personality which i dont want to get into plus she looks like a young michelle pfeiffer i think michelle pfeiffer is the hottest woman alive and actually have an outfithair based on pfeiffers character in scarface lol and is truly lethal in the right hands   nina has always been more challenging to master than most other characters from her chain throws in tekken 1 to her insane difficulty in tekken 7 though they did tone her difficulty from extreme as fuck down to really hard in s3 no more x5 iws1 combos constantly which gives me a sense of pride that i know how to use her effectively which i think is true of most serious nina players most nina mains i know are like me in their 30s im 31 and have been maining her since the original tekken i literally play no one but nina until ive mastered her in that particular game and then ill start maining others jun and michelle in t1t2 anna xiayou julia and jin in t3 anna in ttt steve and lee in t4 lee again in t5 feng in t6 and negan and kazuya in t7   basically what im saying is my main focus is always on nina and serious nina mains grew with her throughout the series i take tekken too seriously and have since online play began  thats some solid advice and im gonna take it thank you bro
,,,MrWinston5,gum,breathe deeply have a break in the fresh air chew a gum or suck on a hard candy whenever you feel the urge to light up a cigarette if you eventually give up and you smoke one after that just think did i really need that do i feel better after inhaling this shit do i really need cigarettes to go back to baseline  i know its hard to quit but you must focus on negative aspects of smoking because thats no positive ones  stay strong my brother
,,,lifemedic1ne,opioid,i know that morphine dosages are somewhere between 1050 mg but since this si morphine sulfate i suppose its somewhat different   if your calculations are true when i was iving 100 mg and one time also as high as 150 mg that would be equal as 133 mg oxycodone which is insane and i would be dead i was nodding and pretty shitfaced from 40mg iv and that was when i had a h habit  id really want to know how and why are sulfate doses so higher but cant find the info anywhere here where im from these 200 mg capsules are the only ones they have in the opioid replacement therapy and if they would be giving them to anyone who comes for the treatment something would go wrong quickly this is why i am convinced 200 mg od sulfate  200 mg standard morphine  could you link me to those charts you mentioned
,,,somethingherion,black^opiates,did everything just like go black or was it like an progression i‚Äôve heard stories of people who have died and been brought back and they have like a weird thing about flashbacks and stuff did you experience any of that again i don‚Äôt want to offend anybody bc i know this is hard to talk about just sort of want to know what my cousin went through before she passed awayi had a pretty minor addiction in comparison to most addicts i quit without rehab haven‚Äôt done na not to say i wasn‚Äôt sick but my addiction was not nearly to the extent of others  i only quit because my apartment got raided by 12 and i was scared of getting arrested but it‚Äôs only a misdemeanor where i live to be caught in possession of any narcotic so that fear is sort of diminishing a lot of people tell me to just give it some time and really think about it but this feeling has been going on for about 2 weeks now it isnt getting better only stronger i have no reason not to do especially since i have zero tolerance now to opiates chipping is easy enough i‚Äôve done it plenty i just fucking miss being happy i‚Äôm on lithium currently for my bipolar2 i go to therapy once a week i can‚Äôt take antidepressants since they somehow throw me into ‚Äúpsychosis‚Äù nothing helps not even kratom  i still want some dope

,,,realcat67,opiate^opiates^black,i am not claiming this for anyone else but for me mat is the worst of both worlds im not getting high not enjoying it but at the same time i am a slave to it i have to take it every day i have to suffer the subtle side effects that no one talks about hormonal changes brain chemistry etc  i dont know what motivated you to come and show us the light but if you spent more than 5 minutes on this sub you would see that probably at least 20 of the posts deal with how to handle withdrawal   its not like there is a scarcity of information here so yes at this point i am wondering why there is a big push for mat coming out of nowhere looking like a college term paper in my view this entire subject is a justification for what is basically a crime to begin with its like ok you guys can have your alcohol and your pot but opiates are highly illegal still and we are going to continue to make your lives miserable by restricting opiate use in every possible way   and people keep dying while the pharmaceutical companies and doctors keep making money  please dont talk to me about harm reduction on one hand while the government keeps locking people up with the other its a really bad jokethat is really interesting for some reason the first thing to go when i start getting high is my desire to play music i am already one of the worlds worst musicians but opiates take away my musical balance  some people say drugs make them more creative but i have never found this to be true the only thing they make me is sleepythe one good thing about cold turkey is you know that you are getting through it as fast as possible when you take any other opiate you may or may not prolong the wd there is no way to know without testing it i went cold turkey from a long term heroin habit and it did take several weeks but eventually you will feel better there are tons of posts listing all the comfort meds you can get that can help you like benzos and clonidine but arrange it now because you will probably not be able to do much once you startamazing it is so easy to forget about all those things that happened to you or that you made happen but when you see them in black and white it is overwhelming the flair labels this as a story but it sounds right on to me i admire your ability to write something like this i dont think i couldi look forward to the day someone finally understands addiction i have 2 brothers and 2 sisters my mom my dad my siblings were all insane overachievers who have the house with the white picket fence i have nothing but admiration for my parents the other family members lets just say i didnt make their lives easy  we have no history of addiction in the family as far back as we can trace it into germany and russia one sister enjoys a glass of wine from time to time my other sister has migraines but she takes her meds as prescribed  i went to the best school my parents could find i never suffered any sort of abuse everybody liked me at school even though i could be a jerk at times  i always got invited to parties people wanted me to hang out etc  we all went to college became professionals money was never an issue i had a number of jobs over the years and loved most of them on the outside i never had any problems until i started getting busted for cashing in fake percocet scripts but i had that rigged so i never did any prison time  on the inside no matter how good things seemed i always felt like there was a hole when i was exposed to opiates it seemed to fill that hole for the first time you guys have heard all that before  so how do i end up a hardcore iv heroin addict how do i try to compare my life with that of darkbtrfly i cant there is no comparison it makes no sensethis is an interesting topic and it would be great if there were actual research at 25 mg per day you really should not feel any withdrawal symptoms yet there are plenty of people that have said they experienced wd even at very low levels  one of the better posts i have seen was from a guy suggesting that you form a liquid solution for ultra low doses like dissolving 10 mg of oxy in 10cc of water to make your taper accurate  because realistically with the half life of oxy at 4  6 hours it is questionable whether the dose actually does anything idk eventually you would reach the point where you would effectively have zero opiates in your system but we dont know what happens with extremely low levels maybe some people have to have zero levels of outside opiates to begin recovering their own natural opiate production   some people say that tapering just prolongs the whole process and they have to go cold turkey in the end other people say that tapering works really well there are too many unknowns to be able to say for sure  but i do think switching to kratom would be a good idea if you can be disciplined with your dosagethere is no induction with methadone it is more like a longer acting opiate it takes a day or two to build up in your system but thats it some people say it makes them foggy and has other side effects i was on it years ago but have never touched it since then
,,,elliotobii,opiates^opiate^opioid,it‚Äôs amazing until it‚Äôs hell i had this same idea in mind i wish i could leave the opiates alone and just go back to having depression because the lows i experience now are so much lower than i thought was possible i see death as the only escape that will leave me at peace and not in constant turmoil just my 2 centzthis this thiss thanks for saying this i‚Äôm just now figuring out that opiates have and will lead me to more misery if i just keep using them expecting something different to happenit‚Äôs funny how you start to hate something you once loved so much after a certain amount of years the hate seems to outweigh the love at times but the love for opiates is still so strong at least for mefor ppl who are opiate naive it‚Äôs very strong u could‚Äôve probably only took 1mg and still got high for 12 hours i‚Äôm on sub maintenance trying to quit shooting heroin and it doesn‚Äôt really get me high at all but helps a lot w cravings for ppl who need it it‚Äôs a great tool but is also a cost effective way to get high for others which i‚Äôm honestly all about just know that after about a week of taking it all the recreational effects will go away and then the wd does sucki have never been on methadone  so i have no comparison but now that i‚Äôve been on them for a couple months they really don‚Äôt get rid of my ‚Äú i need opiates in my veins now‚Äù anymore they helped a ton at the beginning but at this point i am just taking them to stave off the physical symptoms the only time i feel genuine relief from fiendish thoughts is if i stop the subs for a couple days then go back on them and for the first day it‚Äôs alright but the next day is more of the same honestly i just want to ween off them so i can do shoot some dope codeine is just badly metabized into morphine cut out the middle man and do some morphine with benadryl and it‚Äôs the same fucking feeling lean really is one of the lowest tier opiates it‚Äôs not worth home brewing lolyou right i‚Äôm working on getting clean from opiates mostly just reminiscing about how fucking good they felt nothing else can comparethat just goes to show how strong bupe is yeah 2 mg would probably be way too much for someone with no opiate experience i‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs a cheaper opiate out there that‚Äôs not gonna be laced with fenti‚Äôve found that taking it every other day gives it much more of an oomph but u have to go to every other day without it which suck but i‚Äôve found this way to actually give me good relief when i do take it  i also tend to feel more of an opiate felling after a vigorous workoutthanks for the response i‚Äôm guessing that drug x could be a pgp inhibitor like piperine in black pepper or omeprazole maybe i guess i‚Äôm going to have to do some trials of my own i know that when i have taken loperamide for opioid withdrawals that omeprazole and black pepper helped it to work which leads me to believe the same could be done for bupe possiblyyou can still toss the crushed shit on the foil just fine and smoke it i‚Äôd recommend staying away from opiates after this because relying on them really is hell and quitting them is even worse
,,,Purple-Builder,opiates,yeah i know alot of smokers as i am also one myself but the issue is as im not in the city anymore just a smaller coastal town none of the people i know that use recreational drugs have any experience with opiates letalone have any idea where to find them but i will keep searching slowly but surely fingers crossed i find them üò•

,,,SugarMagnolia96,black,it has cross tolerance with valium and if the 15mg valium dosage you mentioned is accurate an equivalent dose of xanax would be 1mg i‚Äôd say to start there and wait about 30 minutes to see how you feel if you can handle the taste dissolving it under your tongue will make it kick in even faster not sure if you‚Äôre still having panic attacks but if so i‚Äôd use this route of administration xanax is also a muscle relaxer which should help give you some relief too hope that does the trick but if not and you have more access you can take another 25mgs just don‚Äôt go over 2mgs total cause you might black out
,,,MrAtreus420,opiate^opiates,thats surprising to hear i myself am i heavy opiate user but like all opiate users except for yourself apparently lol i looooove me some benzos every ope dope ive ever met or used with has had a love for benzos as wellyeah not very many people realize the spectrum of opiate users most are people like me with prescriptions to oxy or something along those lines that ended up having to turn to the street when this so called epidemic hit and all the doctors got afraid of the dea coming to send them to jail for trying to give their patients a better life most people dont realize how intensely chronic pain can fuck up your life even if that isnt the case only a small number of opiate addicts are the people going around robbing everyone and using dirty needles they find laying by the dumpster outside of the local hospital most opiate addicts are very intelligent individuals leading very normal lives and just prefer the warm hug of an oxy rather than drinking that box of wine or 6 pack of beer inside damn near every american fridgedont mix the diazepam or temazepam with that it will slow breathing down incredibly i have asthma myself and can tell you for sure that if you dont have a high enough tolerance to opiates and mix valium with that you will either need a breathing treatment or you will odkpins and xans take the same amount of time to breakdown and release the drug and the feeling would hit you at the same time however kpins have a longer half life so the narcotic effect would last longer but it would be pretty fucking hard to distinguish whether you were feeling alprazolam or clonazepam impossible to distinguish if already in an opiate and benzo stupor imomost definitely man she would have died had i not done it the fucked up part about addiction is that even though i knew it had to be done i tried every other way i could think of before resorting to pharmaceuticals not because thats what you should do in any case of any medical situation but because i didnt want to ruin her high and make it to where she wouldnt be able to feel the drugs for the next few days thats extremely sad and it hurts to admit it but that is the grip hard opiates and addiction have on a personthe best feeling i ever had was 10 watson blues 5mg of kpins and about 6 shots of whiskey this would kill regular opiate and benzos naive people though and even sone with tolerancemy tolerance comes from the fact that my very first experience with opiates was with 80mg oxy nasally very very quickly i graduated to intravenous use with my friends dad who was a dr that stole meds was also prescribed oxy and also shot heroin with me all of this at 16 years old i have never truly quit and ill be 29 this year  i do truly need the pain medication now for multiple problems but with my rolerance so damn high oxy and dilaudid cant touch me even injecting 4 of heroin doesnt make me even get itchy forget tryin to nodyoud be correct but if youre already an opiate addict its somewhat nice saves a little money each month but with my tolerance it only lasts a few days if im trying to get high instead of just maintainingsaving her wpuld be getting her clean but i appreciate the sentiment she was already addicted when we met i would never give an opiate naive person their first dose knowing what i know about opiates now thats the equivalent of stabbing a man in every area of his body missing all vital organs and then having the girl stab him in the heart bad analogy but i think you get ithere is what you really need to think about are you always going to be on some form of opiate for the rest of your life or not if you are going to be the methadone will be far superior to the oxy im prescribed 105 of the 30s every month but i was prescribed 100mg daily of methadone for quite some time methadone is more euphoric in my opinion and as for the pain problems methadone like you experienced has a much longer half life meaning it will keep your pain away a lot longer than oxy at any dose the real problem is the withdrawals withdrawals from methadone can last up to a month where as oxy lasts for around 7 days i would try to figure out how much methadone he would put you on if it isnt at least 50mg a day it probably isnt worth it but then again youre only getting 30 a day with the oxy maybe ask if you can try the methadone for a month and if it doesnt work for you switch back to oxy the next monthvor possibly take methadone as your main medication but get a few oxy a month for breakthrough pain
,,,jamielives9,opiate^opiates,how would 20mg oxymorphone compare to 60mg oxycodone an equivalent dose are they pretty much the same high i hear a lot of people say oxymorphone is the best opiate high there is  can you provide details to the differences i‚Äôm very curious and doubt i‚Äôll ever get my hands on oxymorphonei don‚Äôt get benzos w opiates they always make me sleepier and i can‚Äôt appreciate the euphoria as much maybe i‚Äôm just getting the balance wrong what‚Äôs a good ratio for oxy snorted and valium with not much tolerance to eitherok sure i‚Äôll just swallow never done it before but i‚Äôm experienced with opiates and benzos  what kind of dose do you think i should try i‚Äôve heard redosing half way through doesn‚Äôt work well with them so it‚Äôs best to take all at the start shall i take one 300mg pill or 2 600mg should i also try to have an empty stomach or does it not really mattersadly i don‚Äôt but yh i hear people say it‚Äôs better than actual heroin would love to see a tier list based on how nice opiates feel rather than based on how strong they are
,,,tmac4ev,opiates,well when i say ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù it still feels very new to me i feel like i was fucked up and doing opiates everyday just yesterday i don‚Äôt feel the physical wd anymore but the mental part lingers i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs paws i‚Äôm just still learning how to live a normal life again i haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúnormal‚Äù my entire adult life it‚Äôs just a learning process i guess it also takes time to build meaningful relationships again to entertain me all my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were drug related and i obviously can‚Äôt associate with them anymore you know you‚Äôll get there it does get better there will be lingering issues for awhile but i can assure you that i‚Äôm thankful af that i‚Äôm better than the initial stagesno if it helps you then keep taking it weed won‚Äôt ruin your life personally i was addicted to opiates for many years and i‚Äôve taken an array of different things to either help with wd or just recreationally i still consider myself sober because i don‚Äôt have a current addiction problem with anything i take i think sobriety can mean whatever you want it to mean for you and your life not to mention you have a legit medical reason to be taking cbdi think about this a lot i‚Äôm 4 months sober and for at least the first month i wondered ‚Äúis this paws‚Äù anytime i would feel down or anxious if i sit and think about why i‚Äôm feeling the way i‚Äôm feeling i can is usually come to a reason why i‚Äôm feeling the way i‚Äôm feeling other than it just being post withdraw i know paws is a real thing but i think a lot of people mistake their regular feelings coming back for the syndrome you‚Äôve wasted or fucked up your life to varying degrees  while you were using it will take a little bit to fix your finances relationships jobs and not to mention your hormones you‚Äôre still really early on if you think you‚Äôre still having emotionalhormonal issues go see a therapist or psychologist for someone to talk to at the very least who has no bias it seems silly but i‚Äôve been to a few sessions not even regularly and i do feel relieved afterwards life gets better the longer you stay off opiates yes it gets boring and even i still haven‚Äôt found necessarily an appropriate coping mechanism yet but i will and you will too keep pushing throughi‚Äôve only ever taken pee tests for preemployment and i would do them the same day and still come up clean because oxys don‚Äôt fall under the two specific opiates they test for salvia tests i‚Äôm not sure about but i know that oxys aren‚Äôt detectable after about 4872 hours you‚Äôll be goodday 124 here off opiates it does get better i ct‚Äôd it off subs that i‚Äôd been trying to taper from big mistake because i didn‚Äôt do it properly obviously and ultimately just delayed the hell for 24 days i will say that the no sleeping part really had me at my breaking point there towards the end because it was barely improving for the first 23 weeks i was just about to go get prescribed ambien from the doctor and several people on here told me it gets better sleepwise at day 21 i thought ‚Äúok yeah bullshit no one is that precise‚Äù sure as shit the night of day 21 so almost day 22 i slept like 5 or 6 hours rather than 13 hours of very light sleep it slowly started to improve even more after that it‚Äôs amazing how a lot of your symptoms will go away or at least lessen significantly once you start getting decent sleep other than that i would give yourself one more week to start feeling 80 normal but still probably sleeping like shit you‚Äôre past the worst of it keep goingpersonally i would go see a specialist if you don‚Äôt improve in 23 weeks i‚Äôm at 123 days sober from oxys and while weird to talk about for me lol my bowel movements didn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúnormal‚Äù until maybe around 100 days  it wasn‚Äôt exactly diarrhea but not that solid either i don‚Äôt have pain associated with it though except for the initial wd stage i had the same kind of pain you‚Äôre describing when i was on opiates it felt like rocks were stuck in my intensives and just kept building up if the ct scan cane back normal that‚Äôs a good sign but i don‚Äôt think you should still be having pain though thanksgiving has been awhile back by now

,,,InevitableWrangler,opiates,if you buy pressed pills they are more likely to actually contain mdma rather than other amphetamines or stuff like benzofurans or cathinones than ever before no one is putting fentanyl into coke or xanax on purpose what happens is people are cutting heroin or pressing fake percsoxycontin pills with fentanyl and then using the same table or pill press to make fake xans or other pills and thats where the contamination occurs real xanax doesnt feel like opiates and obviously coke and opiates have completely different effects its a common misconception that people are purposely adding fentanyl to drugs other than opiates   also its alot easier to find pure mdma in powder form than ever before as well

,,,WeekndJuice,opiates^opiate^black,opiates like codeine aren‚Äôt very sedating in my experience so i‚Äôm very functional aka have superpowers  adderall or vyvanse type of prescription drugs are pretty fictional in my opinion   benzos not at zombie like doses are very functional imo to  don‚Äôt do meth that‚Äôs because tramadol is a shitty ass opiate hardly an opiate and more of an ssri i‚Äôd just give up on those and try something stronger   ask your docwhat to mix mdmaacid  2cbacid shroomsacid ketamineacid  i‚Äôve heard of opiates being cool but i don‚Äôt really know about that one  no meth please750 mg of tch is a huge amount especially with no tolerance the xanax will keep the anxiety down but even at that dose i don‚Äôt honestly know you‚Äôd most likely just black out and fall asleep   i‚Äôd do 50mg tch and the xanax but that‚Äôs just mexanax acts fast and strong but doesn‚Äôt last long start off with 5mg and see how you feel if you suffer from anxiety or depression you‚Äôll feel it a lot more then someone who doesn‚Äôt   first time i tried benzos i didn‚Äôt think much of them but then i tried them again and wow honestly one of my favorite drugs but i‚Äôm careful with them or at least i think i am   don‚Äôt mix with opiates or alcohol weed potentates it if you smokeamitriptyline is not a benzodiazepines but rather a tricyclic antidepressant it‚Äôs one of the first gen anti depressants and has less side effects then common ssri and maoi antidepressants or at least that‚Äôs what i‚Äôve heard   withdrawal from amitriptyline is not nearly as bad as a benzodiazepine or opiate withdrawal if you want to mitigate the withdrawal as much as possible tapering down would be a good choice  any withdrawal symptoms should not be that harsh especially if you taper down   good luckif you deal with any anxiety there a god send even at small doses if you‚Äôre a pretty calm person it‚Äôll just make you more relaxed depending on the type you take  most that‚Äôll happen is you‚Äôll take enough to forget a week that you‚Äôve been benzed out and black out least that can happen is you get the best sleep you‚Äôve ever gotten  hope this helpsbuy a fent test kit there so inexpensive but can save you‚Äôre life fent pressed pills are very dangerous and in my opinion are just never worth it   fentanyl is one of the strongest opiates on the market and it is very easy to overdose on any fent presses simply due to the fact we don‚Äôt know how much is in the pill itself and it being such a potent opiate   a fentanyl high is much more euphoric and has more of a body high then you‚Äôll ever get from a benzo in my experience if the pill is fent presses you‚Äôll get extremely high off that one bar and could start to nod pretty much you‚Äôll know you took fent due to the intensity of the high    take a quater if you can‚Äôt wait to play it safe do not recommend or order a test kit hope this helpsmdma or 2cb both mixed with weed are pretty awesome i‚Äôd put acid down but sometimes the anxiety overcomes me and ruins if not diminishes the euphoria  i‚Äôve never really found opiates like hydrocodone and oxy to be very euphoric by themselves but there‚Äôs still really enjoyable that‚Äôs just me 
,,,ImProbablyHigh999,opiate^black^dreams,lyrica and gabapentin especially when combined with benzos are awesome for pain   i‚Äôve never taken them for pain but they definitely feel very similar to an opiate especially when mixed with benzos   only differences from an opiate is that you‚Äôll get the munchies and you won‚Äôt itchi black out when i smoke on kpins honestly like my friends say i act normal and everything but i have absolutely no recollection of the night it bugs me out lmaoooi just took 6mg to help me sleep fuck   no in all seriousness i don‚Äôt notice a difference in my dreams other than i can usually remember them better for a few hours after waking up never have had crazy dreams like this in all of my life but on melatonin i definitely can recall things easier   also i‚Äôve literally never had a nightmare in all my 20 years of living is that normali felt pretty drunk and i kept ‚Äúnodding‚Äù not similar to opiate nods but i would find myself staring into space everything kinda started vibrating too i could drive though and i was super talkative it felt like mdma i kept having to take deep breaths because my whole body felt so good like i was getting a full massage i definitely feel like i could up the dose i was just wondering if 750mg was a dangerous dose of lyrica

,,,BigBucs731,opiates^opiate,if you know how to take them its a great high and they potentiate or synergize with benzos and opiates  its all about staggered doses and how you take them look it up ive had some of the best highs of my life of gabacrack no desire coke unless its free heroin did once and former opiate addict  pcp no reason ketamine went into k hole only time  any of that synthetic shit k2 spice bath salts etc i do real drugsthank you im by no means perfect i will still go off the rails evry now and again went hard this weekend in fact it is a very slippery slope its easy to fuck everything up i was never even a stim user until a year ago  for 18 years i was a raging alcoholic and opiate addict that shit ruined my 20s aand 30s and almost killed me multiple times cost me multiple great jobs a few trips to jail and one medically induced coma so i didnt die from alcohol withdrawal im over 2 years sober from booze and actually beat opiate dependance by using stims  ive never been to jail the hospital or lost a job because of responsible use of stims and taking my prescribed benzos as directedbenzos or opiates but thats the start of potential disaster  try a red or green strain of kratom works great for me since i no longer drink and cant smoke weedhow is use gabapentin recreationally this is my method and dosage use carefully as im a well seasoned drug user with a monster tolerance  the biggest factor is staggering the doses your body will absorb only so much gaba at once usually 600mg give or take so whether you take 600mg or 3000mg at once youll only get 600mg  take 2 aleve 45 minutes before 1st dose  1st dose take 300600mg with a caffeinated soda  30 minutes later take 300mg and repeat every 30 minutes until you hit desired dose mine is usually 18002100mg always take with soda and ive found drinking coffee in between also helps also eat a fatty snack it helps absorbrion   also gabapentin will take 23 hours before full effects kick in and it will cause balance issues be careful standing up  the effects i get are increased energy awesome mood lift that makes me very social it relieves my anxiety makes music sound like its coming from speakers sent from angels its also great for nerve pain id compare the high to a mild dose of ecstasy without the extreme euphoria its like part benzo part opiod and part adderall   now gabapentin also has another phenomenal characteristic it synergizes with benzos and potentiates opiates  synergy with benzos amplifies the effects of both drugs as one works on one gaba receptor and vice versa essentially it makes both stronger  opiate effects are potentiated or made stronger when gabapentin is taken before hand  ive used both combos and can say its the best combination of anything ive ever tried  and finally for stimulant users gabapentin is also useful not only does it aid the comedown it also provides a unique high while helping bring you down  thats the big secret about gabapentin when i hear people say i took 3000mg and it didnt do shit i just shake my head stagger the doses 300mgevery 30 minutes until you hit your sweet spot  warning  you can only do this 1 or 2 times a week max and not in a row tolerance to this drug builds in days  also it does not affect everyone the same some not at all if you have a low drug tolerance i wouldnt start with no more than 900mg and adjust til you find your sweet spot be safe peoplenot really for opiates at all if im lucky ill get a mild initial rush that we all know and love but it fades quickly i was also a daily kratom user for 6 months and that increased my tolerance even higher a while back a buddy gave me 3 oxy 15s id already taken morning dose of kratom so i hung on to them until the following evening and didnt take any kratom for about 36 hours took all 3 after work that night and it felt like one 10mg perc no rush no euphoria and barely any high its like i have a permanent tolerance so i just dont seek them outi have an insane opiate tolerance and dont take them anymore because i just dont get a rush anymore and barely feel them and due to the ridiculous price and worrying about fent pressed shit  i was freaking amazed at how hard and how long 2mg lasted even while throwing up for 12 hours i was still high and it has a visual trippy effect on me especially closed eye visuals i took 1mg xanax and snorted another 18 about 3 hours ago and i seem higher now than i did an hour ago about to take the other 1mg of xanax and drift of to never never landeveryone else does for opiate wd but everybody is different i found reds least effective i like green if you can find it opms silver malay special reserve capsules are the closest opiate feel for me with your tolerance which is like mine i would start with 12 capsules  i get the best results from 1216 caps will take about an hour and is subtle its not gonna get you high but it will put a dent in withdrawal symptomsi believe it has to do with the gaba receptors alcohol withdrawal is nearly identical to benzos because it acts on the same receptor thats why benzos are used to medically detox someone safely from alcohol at 26 i almost died from alcohol withdrawal i went into full blown delirium tremons and had to be put in a medically induced coma for 4 days to save my life i was a raging alcoholic power drinker for 18 years and have been medically detoxed 3 times since then either klonopin or lorazepam was used everytime thankfully im 26 months sober now  same with gabapemtin it is very good for benzo withdrawal but has a nasty wd of its own  and as a former opiate addict i can although miserable wont kill you alcohol was 10x worse than opiates in terms of wd i went through mild benzo withdrawal but i was on 3mg kpin for only 4 months and was quick tapered by a dr it still was bad and felt just like alcohol wd to me  also suboxone and methadone also come with a terrible withdrawal and require a taper as well so opiate addicts arent getting a free pass they are just using an alternative to delay the inevitableof course not i actually got sick a while ago but ate some lunch and the buzz is still going i did not expect the trippy like visuals especially the closed eye ones im starting to get real sleepy too this stuff is powerfuk with legs like i said i have a monster opiate tolerance and its been years since ive caught a nod but im 8 hours in and the high is still hitting goodoh im a former opiate addict with an insane tolerance it would take 90mg of oxy just to maintain but i havent had any opiod in months

which one of you have dealt with real strong opiate withdrawal  ive dealt with opiate and benzo wd at the same time many times i went to rehab for it after many years of trying to control it and quit  kratom wd is there and its shitty but morphine wd is quite a lot worse kratom wd has limits kinda with opiates it feel like deathi use to snort anything now i really dont like it especially when i snorted black tar vinegar bs lol that bth straight fucks your sinuses up i got a weak meningitis virus from it but it still was such a terrible illness i missed work for it n got hydros from my doc for it when i just needed a doctors note lol  ill snort some roxys or high quality 4 heroin but no coke i dont care for it anyway but my nose gets fucked up too easy now a days and i sometimes get sick a few days after from it  plus my buddy almost died and had to have 2 or 3 brain surgeries to remove infected tissue from his brain theres just so much bad with snorting you can even tell when someone has been snorting stuff by how inflamed their face and nose are sometimes thats pressure in your face which isnt healthyfor the most part they can make me a little moody but i try not to feed into that opiates are the one thing i can do and can completely hide it if i want and i do from many   something ive always said was that heroin has a lot of character  morphine morphine morphinedeff for sure sounds like it was an opiate  opiates make me and some others i know very talkativeyea i use to love it the times i had opiates and coke sure were good but i have 0 recollection other than packing a bowl of crack with heroin on top of my bud and ripping it from the bong lola headache the same hour as railing 15mg of oxy that fuckin sucks  you probably need to rehydrate stay hydrated

rebuild your brain and things will be a lot better long breaks are good tooyea i can go all day without anything but i wont be able to sleep with a headache like that kinda just said fuck it im taking opiates everyday now kinda like a prescription nothing crazy although i am snorting some roxi 30s rn lol  wish opiates werent a big deal so i could talk to my doctor about getting something for my headache to quit i just know it would but weird with the doc i have and weird to introduce myself like that hahaa maybe soonworse part for opiate wd to me right now is the headache at the end of the day and my bones feeling weird when im relaxing trying to sleepyeah it can help not sure how an interview would go tho i think kratom can give a little glassy eye effect but idk  it helps with my anxiety tremendously but it is a partial opioid agonist so there could be trouble quitting it without having more anxiety n stuffalright my bad im tired man but look into the new world order and how the rothschilds orchestrate wars around the world everything is part of something much bigger even drugs especially opiates and cocaine  the whole opiate crisis is just to get people on cheap fent and mexican heroinhawaii is a expensive area and drugs probably have a higher price due to its economy and transportation  roxys are extremely risky these days most of them are pressed with fentanyl the opiate world has changed a lot in the past decade you gotta be real careful with each batch you get nowhappy youve found something that works kratom does wonders for many its amazing its a good idea to keep your doses low and maybe longer time between doses and tolerance breaks but really you should be fine taking high doses for a while as long as youre fine with consuming a bunch of plant matter  also you can look into things that help your opioid receptors and metabolism to opioids  just dont let kratom take you to painkillers as those can really ruin a lot of good things in lifemix the pink10s with the blue 30s with some green 15s and white 20s  ya man opiate life was a lot better just 5 years ago hahathats an anti depressant zofran helps with nausea  kratom will help you get off the oxys try a red strain or go to a doctor and ask for some meds to help you stop you can get prescribed naltrexone at a pharmacy with a physician you just have to go 2436 hrs without doing opiates beforehand  it sounds like youre just getting started and if you use for another month its just gonna make things worse  take magnesium and potassium for the weird bone feelings when youre feeling asleep and melatonin and aspirin to calm you down just stop buying them pressyskratom is great for that man were just saying dont go into it expecting much of a buzz like oxy gives if you quit oxy for a few months then kratom may have a more similar effect  you can get high of kratom if you take enough just dose 5grams and keep dosing 23grams waiting 2030min between youll feel really good but if

,,,HattieLouWho,opiates^opioid^dreams,you need a diagnosis and a referral to pain management then expect to try other alternative treatments before they resort to opiates unless you have a pretty rough diagnosis oh and you have to pass a drug test and most won‚Äôt prescribe anything in the first visit   i have crps so they were pretty much pushing them from the start albeit at low doses while we tried other options still on relatively low doses of hydrocodone but it helps considerably   after that it‚Äôs appts every 4 weeks with random testing and possibly pill counts depending on your provider good luckit can definitely do that but it‚Äôs a super slippery slope i would suggest getting under the care of a psychiatrist to find the right combo of meds and therapy to help you without the risks i am a chronic pain patient also on meds for anxietydepression and i see both a pain management doctor and psychiatrist i did not start opiates until well after my other issues were addressed and under control though i take lexapro lamictal which is well known to help with pain too  so added bonus and a very low dose of seroquel to control that side of thingsi completely disagree with this as a chronic pain patient on opioids they should never be a first line or second line treatment but when other options have failed to evidence adequate relief they should be available i have crps which is considered the most painful chronic condition and opiates make the difference between working a full time job volunteering and being an active mom and being housebound relying on either my husband or govt handouts which person is better for society which person has a the fuller life because of them   i was really really reluctant to add one to my regimen but it has made a huge difference at a low dose 75325 hydrocodoneapap 3day i don‚Äôt think any of the chronic pain patients on opiates want to be  we just want less pain  but when all else fails then it‚Äôs an option we should all havedo you have a pcp that can refer you to pain management or whoever diagnosed your condition with all of the opioid hysteria they‚Äôre not going to prescribe at urgent care or er for anything chronic unfortunately i would pursue pain management asap and ask your primary if they can help until theni would recommend asking for a referral to pain management asap if you don‚Äôt need it you can cancel the appt but they have lots of tools at their disposal that can greatly improve your quality of life i have crps which is insanely painful and there‚Äôs no way i could function without proper pain management   i second what others have said about opiates i was really reluctant at first but they have given me my life back i was calling out of work crying in pain and pretty much miserable but adding a low dose of hydrocodone made a huge difference and now i only regret not doing it sooner i also take lyrica celebrex which is great for arthritis by the way and tizanidine as needed plus lidocaine patches have you tried those they‚Äôre otc in the states  try the salon pas brand and see if it helps you   if you have other questions i‚Äôm happy to chat just pm me good luck and hang in there it gets better once you have a proper treatment plan in placehave you been to a doctor to try to figure out why it‚Äôs all happening there‚Äôs not a ton of info in your post so it‚Äôs hard to know what all you have done to date also have you been to pain management yet i would try both do those asap there is nothing wrong with being a responsible opioid user if it improves your quality of life it almost sounds like ehler danlos syndrome based on what you said but i only have a tiny piece of the puzzle to go off   i would also consider a psychiatrist if you tell another doctor you have contemplated suicide you could wind up with a whole host of other issues so getting mental health under control is just as important as the pain at this point the two go hand in hand but pm seems more inclined to help if you say you have a psychiatrist already at least around here   i hope this helps somei would be honest with them and tell them how it‚Äôs limiting your functionality and ask what else they have to offer i would not say ‚Äúwell when i take two i can function‚Äù because that will be a red flag of abusing meds even though you‚Äôre not i would also say it doesn‚Äôt work as well as it used to and kind of let them connect the dots   i‚Äôm in a similar situation where my crps is worsening so meds that have been working aren‚Äôt really cutting it i have my monthly pm appt tomorrow and going to talk about options  hoping not to increase my dose but i also need to be able to hold it together enough to work and get a few hours of sleep i‚Äôm hoping

,,,meskalinpsilocybin,opiate^opiates^black^opium^opioid,good question indeed my wife who used to take acid coke and mdma with me when we were dating and who still likes to smoke pot tells me every time when that topic comes up to never ever tell our kids about my drug use or her past drug experiences our kids are still toddlers so i dont know yet how to address that topic but i do know that i will not stick to the typical parent bullshit propaganda of drugs are evil just because i and the government say so but rather educate them about their real risks i will warn them about the real dangers of drugs for example what opioids did to me and how many of my old friends died because of them i still battle an ongoing addiction to medically prescribed morphine used to do heroin too but got over it with the help of my addictioligist yet im still addicted to opioid painkillers these days which is a downward spiral that i never ever want my kids to fall into opiate withdrawl and the endless circle to just feel normal is something i wouldnt wish upon my greatest enemy when it comes to pot and psychedelics i would like to educate them properly that they have all the time in the world to explore these things if they wish to but only once their minds and brains are fully developed meaning over 21 i want to teach them to reach their full intellectual potential without chemicals same goes for most other drugs humans get high since the days of ancient rome athens or alexandria they have their place in history but all of them have so much destructive potential if used frequent and while being too young i want them to at least not damage their brains and bodies while they are still teenagersdaily use aka addictions 1 opiates 300400mg morphine hcl 2 cannabis 1g of weed or 05g

this subreddit so cringeworthya year is easy i was using opiates on and off for 10 years all throughout my 20s never got addicted until i had to undergo 5 surgeries with lots of physical pain coupled with mental pain by my dad dying and my then girlfriend leaving me that‚Äôs when addiction ‚Äûfinally‚Äú hit me it‚Äôs not about willpower it‚Äôs about circumstances heavy physical and emotional trauma mixed with long going scripts for heavy painkillers get you there and then it‚Äôs almost no turning back anymore anyone who thinks they won‚Äôt get addicted because they successfully flirted with opiates for a year or two without ever withdrawing is lying to themselves all it takes is life itself hitting you hardand as my 3rd comment you dont have to be scared on a stronger dose either the known maximum amount of black market lsd blotters is in the 200 to 250mcg range no lab will lay stronger blotters for a mass market now 200 to 250mcg is considered a full psychedelic dose its the same dose albert hofmann tried on his first self experiment with lsd the visuals and the mind trip will be stronger in that range but its not at all unpleasant with the right set and setting a bad set and setting can be hell on 120mcg and vice versa personally i prefer mid to high doses of lsd to small ones as its much easier to go with the flow of the experience as it sucks you in lower doses can make me paranoid whereas 200mcg plus forces my mind to just let the psychedelic do its work fighting against it is no longer an option if you understand what i meani had the same experience with lsd if you dose opiates in my case it was either opium or heroin back then simultaneously to your psychedelic of choice it will kill the trip almost immediatly what does work great though is taking your opiates at the tail end of the trip for a smooth comedown did this several times lately with pharmaceutical hydromorphone or morphine  and it worked great every time if you are addicted to opiates but want to trip on psychedelics id suggest to take your poison of choice a few hours before you trip just take enough to not go into withdrawal during your trip and do more once the comedown sets in nothing is better than to slowly transform the psychedelic rush into nodding and daydreaming while getting sleepy and comfy under warm blankets to me this felt like dozing off in an victorian opium

never on 5meo 5meo experiences also tend to be for me more on the rough and dark side being pushed in an eternal circle of life and death and suffering whereas dmt has an alice in wonderland kind of uplifting feel everything is crazy but its ok and kind of funwhat my good doctor told me lately in defense of the evilsadistic ones these docs treat you bad because they are afraid of getting charged and  or loosing their license due to the ongoing opioid epidemic crazyness in politics and media before they risk getting in trouble for writing you a decent script they prefer to chase you away by threats accusations and lies most of them are not evil in nature but rather scared of destroying their career or getting jailed themselves by supplying a patient that might look like an abuser with opioid scripts his view made sense to me on second thought doesnt change the fact that there are more than enough fucktards out there with medical diplomas who enjoy emposing their power over you and seeing you withdrawal from the very same meds they prescribed to you in the first placei know man not too proud of this habbit either especially since i became a father of twin toddlers their mum is a lawyer working against human trafficking and weapons and drug trade so my hobbies and addictions are not too welcome in family life  until this summer i was on 24mg hydromorphone er plus 6x 26mg ir plus the occasional heroin binge on top then my old doctor whos been prescribing me opioids since 5 years got under opioid epidemic surveillance and suddenly accused me of not needing the pain meds any longer and actually being a junky and dropped my dosage to 2x4mg a day needless to say i was in almost unbearable withdrawal in the following months i spent almost all of my savings on dope heroin sometimes pretty pure other times fent laced and was visiting 3 other pain doctors who all either turned me down accused me of being a junky or wanted to send me to rehab while i know im addicted to opiates i also have real chronic pain after 4 surgeries on my spine and two on my elbow which left me with constant nerve pain and inflammations luckily in november i finally met a new pain doc  addictiologist i was completely honest with him about my usage of everything which the urine test verified anyhow but i thought i better start this thing without any more lies and to my surprise he turned out to be an super understanding non judgemental doc he put me on 400mg extended release morphine and didnt even force me to quit marijuana as he knows it helps people in my situation only thing he was really strict about was to never ever use heroin again especially these days with so many cutting agents and fentanyl analoges in the dope he also asked me to stop benzos for good and only use them as a last resort thing after i followed his orders and the urine samples only came out positive for morphine and thc he became almost friendly towards me and didnt treat me like a piece of shit addict like the other recent docs did his biggest fear for me was either oding on cut heroin or getting in trouble with the police  so yes it is a pretty big dose but it also allowed me to get out of the vicious heroin circle and i am so fucking grateful to finally have found a doc again who trusts me and is willing to prescribe what it takes to deal with the chronic pain issuesduring the breakup with the back then love of my life i also had to undergo 5 surgeries on my spine the pain from the operations coupled with the emotional trauma of the break up  being all alone lead me to a serious opioid addiction that to this very day is still impregnated in my brain i start each day with 300mg morphine hcl up my butt if i could go back in time i would urge my younger self not to seek peace in addictive chemicals i know its not easy but i wouldnt want you to go the same path as me with benzos hole yourself into another universe with the ketamine but please dont fall into the benzo trap wishing you ‚ù§Ô∏èim taking extended release morphine daily for pain management no problems while mixing it with ketamine except its more likely to throw up so get yourself in a safe position before entering the hole a positive side effect of using k along with opiates ketamine seems to have synergies with morphine in its pain blocking activities after a day on k i can usually lower my typical dose of morphine by 30 to 50  for a few days for pain managent  or if used normally the ketamine allows me to fully feel the euphoric effects of morphine again which normally subside with regular use  once physical addiction sets ini never tried that one but speaking in terms of potency 100mg of morphine hcl used orally never got me really high or nodding out its my favorite opiate in terms of pain management  analgesia and it helped me tremendously to get off the heroin train and its withdrawal trainstations but for a decent highrush those 100mg needed to be boofed never tried iv or im application as i only do this with sealed pharmaceutical vials and the morphine hcl came in er pills if you want to have the typical dreamy carefree euphoric high you either have to do 100mg via your butthole or you need to take much more orally depends on tolerance of corse for me its 300 to 400mg of the er formula  but then i feel it for over 24 hoursopium is for home use dissos are great

pharmaceuticals is pretty high if you‚Äôre also coming from more liberalartsy education circles chances are high nearly 50 percent of your friends like to get high too and of those 50 half of them have their own plug the rest share it with them these circles get less close once you finish collegeuniversity and follow the mo to fr joboffice career routine but every time you‚Äôre in need to go back to your relatively careless days at campus those old friends are still there to call and meet up that means if they didn‚Äôt die in the last 10 years which is usually the case in 1 out of 5 these

,,,murules1,opiates^opiate^black,vyvanse junkie here   vyvanse‚Äôs effects are pretty much indistinguishable to adderall  meth  coke  extreme focus interest and pleasure gained from any task no matter how trivial or boring if you sit down for 5 min you will get extremely restless and bored there‚Äôs also a constant flow of adrenaline  that kinda keeps you on edge and makes it hard to sit still as a result your heart beats faster your blood pumps harder and doing simple physical tasks like running or climbing up stairs can be extremely difficult i basically have no appetite and the thought of eating makes me sick food feels dry and flavorless and like your body is rejecting it eat a nutrient dense meal before taking the pill to ensure you won‚Äôt have a bad comedown physically if you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat hearing ringing in your ears to the point of deafness or getting extremely dizzy are common strangely though in this mindset the head rush you sometimes get can feel immensely pleasurable you can try to trigger the rush yourself if your curious by laying down for 1015 minutes and standing up really quickly it only really happens to me when i take 100mg but since you have no tolerance maybe that will do it for you it‚Äôs weird as fuck but in a kinda indescribable way it‚Äôs oddly pleasurable   the euphoria is extreme probably the strongest of any substance i have ever tried you just feel this wave of relaxation and stimulation constantly flowing throughout your body you love yourself and the world and everything around you and become extremely confident and social socially and academically this is actually pretty dangerous because to be honest it totally does make you like the perfect version of yourself to you and to others which also feels really good these are all of the wholesome emotional effects though and the ‚Äúrush‚Äù or ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù that people are usually chasing is very hard to describe if you‚Äôve ever tried weed or opiates i would describe their euphoria as ‚Äúwarm‚Äù but amph euphoria feels more like this smooth cool buzzing of pleasure in your head   the effects kick in around 30min and peak at 34 hours from that point the effects will slowly ramp downward for 810 hours until your pretty much back to normal i wouldn‚Äôt expect to be able to sleep though as i‚Äôve done the math and learned the lesson over and over and over you can not sleep until 1618 hours after dosing this is super fucking annoying but there‚Äôs no way around it except smoking a shit ton of weed or taking a xanax or something so you just have to comply   fair warning though before experiencing this i didn‚Äôt even understand addiction and could always easily and control and pace myself with no problem but the fucking second i started to feel this feeling go away when i first tried vy i immediately took more later after trying real speed and shit i realized i actually like damphetamine what vyvanse is converted to more than i like regular amphetamine and so do a lot of people this also means though that vyvanse is more addictive to me than meth because it‚Äôs my doc also i started to understand why people snort drugs because having to wait 15h for each pill to take effect is a big problem when you are stim fiending and just need something in your system now now over a year and a relapse later i am still helplessly addicted to and dependent vy so have fun be safe and most importantly be very careful about your usage it‚Äôs easy to think that because it‚Äôs pharma and just a pill it‚Äôs not that dangerous but it is literally one molecule off of meth and in my case even more addictive  oh and also never mix alcohol with like anything it has a fuck ton of interactions and most of them are not greatwhile overdosing on opiates most of the time you don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on or even if you do you don‚Äôt care at all and barely feel any pain physical or mental because the drug just numbs you completely to that level of emotion or sensation your father had a peaceful deathlook like klonopin 05mg‚Äôs got the same pill with the same symbol it‚Äôs pharma just yellow not blue if this is oxy and you weren‚Äôt just scammed with benzo‚Äôs dunno if opiate dealers do this then they‚Äôre definitely presses proceed with cautionreally shitty dirt cheap bud sprinkled with a very small amount of fentanyl basically just feels like a stronger more addictive version of weed   also drug dealers are always willing to risk killing their weed customers in an effort to turn them into opiate  cocaine addicts turns out hard drug addicts spend a loooot of money on drugsi can never tell if people are kidding when they say shit like this cuz i figure if you actually did heroin you wouldn‚Äôt call it ‚Äúblack tar heroin‚Äù but also why would you say this if it wasn‚Äôt true

,,,CuirPork,chocolate^black^opiate,i moved in with her shortly after being evicted from my place on castro street but couldnt stay with her for long because i had an ex lover that would threaten her so i lived homeless for about six months with no hope of ever getting out of this mess i was in during this time we kept in touch and i did everything i could to help her but it never felt like enough to pay her back for saving my life but then the weight of all that i had lost and the best possible future i could imagine for myself led me to think about suicide  one night after taking a couple hits of ecstacy and several hits of acid i had a terrible experience where my best friend left me at a strange party alone everyone thought he was my boyfriend but he wasnt so when i asked his friends if they had seen him their compassion for me was tangible i didnt understand why they all felt so terrible for me but i could sense it they explained that he had gone home with this other guy which was fine by me they just thought they were saying that my boyfriend had left me it was crushing to see such compassion in these peoples faces it made me think about what they were seeing a homeless strung out kid whose boyfriend just left him  so i left the party and started walking i was crying enough that i remember the headlights of cars passing in the street looked like dandelions i thought about how simple it would be to just walk into traffic and not have this kind of pain anymore  but then i was suddenly at the townsend club that i had designed the logo for they knew me and the owner of the club grabs me and brings me inside he gave me a handful of doublestacked rainbow blotter acid in gellcaps i sat on the bleachers until the club was closed and the owner helped me to the doorreally tripping hard  when i left i followed my normal routine i walked down the street to star donuts and out of habit got in line when it was my turn to order i was too high to figure out what to do fortunately they recognized me and asked if i wanted the usual blueberry donut and a chocolate milk   when i get to the counter she rings me up and tells me the total now keep in mind there are cops in this donut shop hanging out i realize that some sort of transaction is supposed to be happening so i reach in my pocket to hand her whatever i hadwhich was about a dozen hits of rainbow acid i turned my palm face up to give them to her and she lovingly closed my fingers over the drugs and told me that they were on her she encouraged me to take them and to eat them outside which i did  as the day went on i grew more and more aware of my lack of hope for the future and as lazy old suicide was begging me for attention i gave in to an even more insidious internal voice  the voice said listen you got nothing to lose right now why not go balls to the wall and burn it out at which point i immediately swallowed all twelve hits of doublestacked rainbow acid and continued walking around downtown san francisco waiting to lose my mind completely  having been homeless while waking up to someone trying to steal my shoes while i slept i knew how important leather platform shoes were so i took them off to carry them close to my body makes sense right   i could feel my shirt a metallic stretch material sticking to every square inch of my upper torsoe and it was driving me nuts so i took it off and draped it over my shoes which i had under my arm  my shorts were super comfortable or i have no doubt i would have been naked   i started having this reaction to the 30 hits of acid i was on i recognize the behavior and was helpless to stop it it goes like this  i am really really sad about whats happening and i start crying but not just crying sobbing and wretching out of control but then another part of my brain realizes this and get angry slowly it takes over and the tears and sobbing are replaced by flexed muscles fists clenchedanger which when you think about the two extremes is pretty funny funny enough that i relax my fists and start laughing laughing out loud as hard as you can laugh becuase it keeps getting amplified by how funny it all is pretty soon your sides hurt and you get scared that you are never going to get this under control from laughter comes fear and the tears start up this is a cycle that goes on for a long time maybe an hour but each emotion lasts for only a minute or two you experience this cycle over and over and i honestly thought this was the end i would never recover  so im in the moscone center having this breakdown when i catch a glimpse of this shirtless dude walking towards me i remember thinking hes pretty cute and all but wtf hes obviously one of those fucked up crazy people you see on the streets talking to themselves how does someone get that fucked up it was this point that i was face to face with this guy and suddenly realized that i was standing next to a mirrored building i had an immediate out of body experience when i realized that i was there i was the fucked up guy that runs around homeless screaming and yelling and crying   i was instantly sober and realized what had to happen i walked about 20 feet to a pay phone we had those back in the day and dialed my parents collect they answered and i said simply i have a drug problem to which they were so relieved to hear they asked if they needed to come out to get me or if i could make it to the airport  not for about 3 days i told them and told them i would call back  i immediately went to find my friend that had saved my life she brushed me off and helped me get it together so i could go home to my familyagain saving my life  i would only ever see her or hear from her one more time in my life she was doing a lot better but still in the business i tried to express how much i appreciated her but she wasnt the mushy type  30 years later i notice she is living back in san diego she has a great life with a lot of great friends i see pictures of her smiling and having fun which i seldom got to see when i knew her i get the feeling she is off the drugs or at least out of the business i have sent her a friend request but have not received a reply i wont push it  sorry for the tldri am fortunate to have cheated death more than once i offer these two examples of where i should have died but by some miracle managed to live i have numerous examples but these are the first two  cheating death  first time my birth  my mother was put in a girls school in wyoming when she was a kid she had tried to run away from her stepfather who would molest her and beat her so often that she had to have a plastic bridge of her nose added after he literally caved her face in while she was there she had gotten pregnant by my biological father but since she was 16 they took the baby from her and sold it black market  2 years later when she got pregnant by the same man she was 9 months from graduating when they decided to hold her back she decided that she would rather die with the baby inside of her rather than let them take the baby so at nine months pregnant she manages to escape and find someone to hide her for two weeks while she waited for my father to arrange her escape he was air force and managed to sneak her onto a military transport plane out of wyoming to abilene texas in a jump seat at 95 months pregnant  when they landed she was rushed to the hospital and gave birth to me i was 10lbs 9oz and the largest baby born in the hospital that year at 23 inches long my mother was only 52  when i came out i came out elbow first and there was no way to reposition me they literally cut her open from the top of her vagina to just under her ribcage and pulled me out somehow they then used these horrific clamps that held her flesh together as they sewed her up she still has this unbelievably jagged scar with dots running up the sides of it where the teeth punctured the flesh to hold it together all the way up her abdomen  during this time i was without oxygen and nearly died even so they informed my mother that i would likely be brain damaged and would never be a normal child fortunately they were wrong and by 8th grade i scored 1600 on my sats  cheating death  second time miracle aunt  when i was about 5 years old we lived on a farm in rural wyoming my father was long gone and my mother worked on the farm we lived in a little hut next to the barn while the farmer lived in a nice house down the way the farmer had two really obnoxious spoiled kids  one day i noticed these two kids heading for the rabbit cages presumably to see the new baby rabbits i knew you couldnt touch the babies without having their mother kill the babies or at least neglecting them so i started crossing the field yelling at them not to touch the babies as i was getting close one of the kids picks up a cement clod and hucks it at me  it hit me just above my eye and i started bleeding really bad as head wounds tend to do i was a screamer so it was not unusual for me to be screaming at the top of my lungs usually it was the nasty goat that chased me and pinned me against the barn that caused me to scream so nobody came to my aid until i got in the hut and my mom could see all the blood  she tried to stop the blood with salve and the blood continued to just squirt out she freaks out  wraps my head in a towel and throws me into the jeep weve got 13 miles to the nearest local hospital   when she gets to the irrigation ditch the ditch is flooded for the first time in memory theres no way to go around it and since it was normally bone dry there was no bridge to cross it she had no choice but to drive the jeep blindly into the ditch hoping shed make it  when the jeeps engine was underwater and died she grabbed me and waded to the other side with me over her head she was determined to carry me by foot 13 miles she knew i would likely die but she had no other options the farmer wasnt home and there was no hope but she didnt give up  as my mother got near the top of the ditch someone grabbed me out of her hands she didnt know who it was but she rushed to the top to find my aunt   my aunt grew up 2 hours away from where we lived and she had never been to see my mother she was raised by the grandparents and though they were close its not like they had cell phones in fact we didnt even have a phone and we had no way of knowing that she was coming that day  my aunt happened to be coming to visit us for the first time when she was stopped at the other side of the drainage ditch unable to cross my mom couldnt see her from the other side because the embankment was too tall   she rushed us to the hospital and they were able to stitch my head up and give me 2 pints of blood saving my life  these were but two of the times that i have cheated certain deathyou are undeniably wrong first of all  ghb and its analogs often cause people to bend over at the waist passed out while remaining standing they seem perfectly normal then literally just slouch over in front of you ghb is not an opiate  i can fall asleep anywhere almost at any time its not officially narcolepsy but it has to be close i have often fallen asleep in public when i was exhausted   i have fallen asleep standing up counting money after being up for four days and strung out on meth not an opiate most dealers i have known have done this as well  i have friends that have acted just like this guy described from alcohol or cough syrup alone  when i was in the military it was not unusual for people to fade in and out of a delirious state where they functioned great one moment then unable to function because they were asleep due to physical exhaustion  there are numerous cases where someone would exhibit this kind of behavior without being on opiates   like for example the exact excuse the young man offered i havent been sleeping well   it certainly doesnt seem fair that you are willing to make such a claim without providing a reference that opiates are the only drug that would allow you to look healthy normal and exhibit classic traits of physical and mental exhaustion seriouslynot possible

,,,Crimson_Entity,chocolate,idk i just really was not expecting to get a chocolate starfish in my face when i opened this app and really i dont appreciate it
,,,thelarustatrust,opioid^opiates^opium^black,are you sure its the ssri aspect of tramadol that makes you feel like that and not the opioid aspect many opioid users i know say opioids are the only thing that makes them feel like a normal person that applies to me in a huge sense morphine or really any other fullagonist opioid is the only thing that makes me feel comfortable in my own skin when you feel like that its easy as fuck to get hooked i want to be like that again 247 was almost the exact same thing i said when i first took oxy i was taken by a huge level of euphoric energy and just walked from the living room to the kitchen and from the kitchen to the living room thinking my god i want to feel like this forever one month later i was hooked be carefuloxycodone is not converted into morphine its actually converted into noroxycodone and oxymorphone and most opiates arent turned into morphine either only a few opioids are metabolized into it like codeine heroin and nicomorphinebut opioids kinda make you hallucinate in a way dont they although not in the psychedelyc sense i mean thats why opium addicts were said to have a dreaming habit the book confessions of an english opium eater is full of reports of hallucinations the writer had while he was nodding on the stuffin principe of course its possible but very very few people can actually mantain the moderation in the long run the relief opioids provide is just amazing it kills all kinds of psychological pain it fixes everything in this sense you can use it in moderation for years and then one day a loved one dies you lose your job and you just justify using it more often to deal with the pain its hard to not let it turn into a way of dealing with your problems  heroin is just another opioid under the sun intravenously its just morphine with an even more intense rush than regular morphine but its illegality makes it more dangerous than pharma opioids since you never know how much youre taking if you live in the us or canada there has never been a time more dangerous to be a heroin user than todays given the fent advent in a way its even more dangerous if you use it in moderation since regular users at least have a tolerance which makes them less likely to od although they also use it everyday multiple times which in this sense makes regular users more likely to od kind of a paradox heremaybe thats where the glory lies once your body starts to crave the blanket the fact that everything will pass the pain the buzz  the hurt its like coming face to face with your own mortality and having the calm presence of mind to not be alarmed or frightened by the current of life and death  dude what you said made me remember a great article   the alkaloids that opioids contain have a large effect on the human brain because they tap into our natural ‚Äúmuopioid‚Äù receptors the oxytocin we experience from love or friendship or orgasm is chemically replicated by the molecules derived from the poppy plant it‚Äôs a shortcut ‚Äî and an instant intensification ‚Äî of the happiness we might ordinarily experience in a good and fruitful communal life it ends not just physical pain but psychological emotional even existential pain and it can easily become a lifelong entanglement for anyone it seduces a love affair in which the passion is more powerful than even the fear of extinction  when we see the addicted stumbling around like drunk ghosts or collapsed on sidewalks or in restrooms their faces pale their skin riddled with infection their eyes dead to the world we often see only misery what we do not see is what they see in those moments they feel beyond gravity entranced away from pain and sadness in the addict‚Äôs eyes it is those who are sober who are asleep that is why the police and ems workers who rescue those slipping toward death by administering blasts of naloxone ‚Äî a powerful antidote without which death rates would be even higher ‚Äî are almost never thanked they are hated they ruined the high and some part of being free from all pain makes you indifferent to death itself death is after all the greatest of existential pains ‚Äúeverything one achieves in life even love occurs in an express train racing toward death‚Äù cocteau observed ‚Äúto smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving it is to concern oneself with something other than life or death  source httpnymagcomintelligencer201802americasopioidepidemichtmlpeople were sourcing for drugs a lot in the dope porn posts apparently it was out of control which is just a shame i really miss the dope porn on opiates missing dope porn is the reason im here on opiatechurch lolthe two things are not mutually exclusive also if kratom is a dangerous drug than thats another good reason for keeping it legal since there is no drug known to man which becomes safer when its production and distribution are handed over to criminals water would become dangerous if

there are a few haundred british users on iv heroin prescribed to this day one of them even posted his amps of pure pharma dope powder here on reddit if you want the link i can send you users who fail at methadone or buprenorphine treatment can get legal access to pharmaceutical heroin by prescription also in the netherlands germany denmark and canada in canada only a few lucky addicts actually are

the day i tried dope for the first time that was it no more alcohol for me the relief opioids provide me is so much better so much cleaner so much more natural than alcohol and its nasty effects thus i rarely drink nowadays as in once every two to three years or so as thomas de quincey once wrote  i do not readily believe that any man having once tasted the divine luxuries of opium will afterwards descend to the gross and mortal enjoyments of alcoholseveral studies have shown that when users get access to prescription heroin their tolerance tends to stabilize at a certain dosage rather than increase endlessly and when their tolerance gets stable then the tendency is for users to voluntarily reduce their dosages rather than increase them for example  gschwend p rehm j bl√§ttler r et al dosage regimes in the prescription of heroin and other narcotics to chronic opioid addicts in switzerland ‚Äì swiss national cohort study european addiction research 20041041‚Äì48 this naturalistic descriptive study of dosages of patients in the swiss prove narcotic prescription program between 19941996 found that heroin was most common 77 as injection and 9 as inhalation followed by oral methadone usually in combination with heroin the authors concluded ‚Äúduring the course of treatment the mean dosage for injectable heroin per day decreased significantly and depending on the treatment regime almost linearly during the treatment period dosages did not increase but generally decreased indicating no further increase in tolerance‚Äù dosages declined even when patients chose their own daily regime  drug policy alliance annotated bibliography  heroin assisted treatment  concerns that hat may encourage drug use have proven unfounded the emcdda and other reviews found that rather than patients increasing their heroin doses they stabilised and often started reducing them usually within two or three months and uptake of other treatments also increased hat also helped reduce heroin availability and recruitment of new users by medicalising use and reducing streetdealing and the number of userdealers clinics are also sited only where a street injecting problem already exists and have soon won strong support from the public when their effectiveness is demonstrated for example being backed by a resounding majority in a national referendum in switzerland  heroin assisted treatment hat saving lives improving health reducing crime  ive made a post about it some time ago httpswwwredditcomropiatescommentsbukav8debunkingmythslongtermheroinuseisbuprenorphine is usually worse than shorteracting fullagonists in the physical dependency aspect since withdrawals from it are just hell fullagonist opioids are worse in the psychological addiction sense because unless you have no significant tolerance opioids such as oxycodone or hydromorphone tend to feel more euphoric than buprenorphine they last shorter than bupe too which adds to their addiction potential as far as damage to the body opioids in general usually are almost harmless in this sense theyre not toxic to organs at all like cocaine or alcohol to give you examples  i dont know much about tapering in principle shorteracting opioids would be better for tapering since they dont accumulate in the body as much as longeracting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine but in real life practice very few people can actually follow through a tapering with shorteracting opioids like oxycodone and morphine precisely because they feel so good and you just dont want to reduce the dose you want that feel good feeling and you want it completely so if you dont have a doctor gradually enforcing the tapering but rather are doing the tapering by yourself it seems it would be usually better to try to do it with a longeracting and not so euphoric at least not for people with a significant tolerance opioid like bupeyes in switzerland youre required to have at least two years of opioid dependency and at least two prior treatment attemptedalmost no one is getting prescribed dilaudid or heroin for addiction i know it happens but its too rare to be worth discussing here  hydromorphone and diamorphine maintenance are getting expanded each year that passes and are actually one of the most efficient ways to treat serious addicts so its definitely worth discussing  however as long as getting high is your primary goal youre probably fooling yourself into thinking that it can stay an easily managed habit like having a glass of wine at night  well yeah it shouldnt be ones primary goal but getting high indeed is part of life of many people who are on maintenance they wake up go to work come home and nod off and thats it all im saying is that it doesnt matter at all and if it doesnt matter maintenance shouldnt really be defended in the grounds of it doesnt make people high because it does make some people high although not everyone and its not an issue most of the time  but if you still want to use opiates every night to get high then youre not really in recovery and more to the point youre still going to live a life that revolves around the drug   wel as i said i dont care about arbitrary standards of what recovery is i care about stability about improving in life and staying away from crime if maintenance got me stable and away from street drugs i may not be clean but i do think im recovered in a very significant sense whether i get high when i come home or not  the other issue is that as long as you chase a high youre going to have your tolerance steadily go up  see this is a myth every research about this issue found that the tolerance of people on injectable heroin maintenance stabilizes at a certain point it gets stable and then many of them actually decrease the dose most of them stabilize at half a gram a day so of course they feel that great rush and sometimes get high but opioid tolerance tends to stabilize i have a whole post quoting all the research about this issue   httpswwwredditcomropiatescommentsbukav8debunkingmythslongtermheroinuseishttpswwwredditcomropiatescommentsbukav8debunkingmythslongtermheroinuseismany people prefer diazepam over alprazolam actually i dont like benzos but i myself think valium is just as good or maybe even more relaxing as far as benzos goes klonopin i just kinda hate tho such a longlasting benzo and particularly uncomfortable  as for the huge buprenorphine doses the purpose is to fill all opioid receptors in the brain so that the user cant get high on junk i would never accept such a thing because i know i cant stay away from junk and being on such a huge dose of buprenorphine would just make my tolerance skyrocket for no good reasonive read an article about doctors prescribing morphine sulfate for iv use as a maintenance tool to a few problematic users in france i fully support that ive also read that heroin use went down in france after the quality of the drug went down and the price increased in 2011 so that many users switched to morphine because it gives an effect similar enough to heroin when injected and that only some old users actually kept using h that remained the case even after 2013 when purity increased again  that made me think that france finds itself is in an interesting scenario right now they could expand the injectable morphine maintenance thing to more users and keep the opioid problem in control in most part as switzerland did with its heroin maintenance program or they could restrict access to morphine so that it will be scarce and thus heroin will make a strong return to the streets of france to supply the demand of users who have lost the access to morph and thus ods will increase  its up to the government to do the right thing but they dont do the right nor the wrong decision they just let the situation which as it is may be controled stay the same which is dangerous as someone who actually lives in france what do you think about thatnaloxone indeed is an opioid blocker but buprenorphine has a higher affinity to the opioid receptors than naloxone naloxone just wont work it cant compete with bupeim an opioid addict im stable on 90120mg of iv morphine it gets me high for years i dont need to increase my dose ever at all although i do in very rare instances im not talking about chasing a high my point is that iv opioid tolerance gets stable as its proven in the link i provided above if youre stable in a dose that makes you high you dont need to chase it its stable thats what happens with most peole on iv heroin maintenance they get high but their tolerances stabilized they dont chase a high or push further because theyre stablei dont think i can become addicted because where i live all you see is fucking crystal meth never opiates  i thought there was plenty of heroin in australia although very expensive
,,,inamortax,dreams,the guitar has nothing to do with it its the melody juice is singing in listen to the yellowcard song and sing lucid dreams at the hook its incredibly similar my guyhuge juice fan but you‚Äôre insane if you think lucid dreams and the yellowcard track have no similarities
,,,bigfucknyikes,opiates^opioid^black^opiate,oh yeah okay i‚Äôm tracking now yeah if you‚Äôve had any kind of psychotic episodes psychedelics probably aren‚Äôt the best idea unless you‚Äôre doing them under the care of a trained professional like your therapist i‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through it darlin‚Äô i can‚Äôt speak to the ketamine thing because while the research i‚Äôve done has shown nothing but incredible results i haven‚Äôt tried it personally i‚Äôve just done a ton of research the fda here in the us has just recently approved a form of ketamine  esketamine  in a nasal spray for treatment resistant depression but i don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs actually been prescribed it the studies do look very promising though there are a ton of ketamine clinics here that do iv infusions for depression but none are covered by insurance  not like everyone here can afford insurance but that‚Äôs beside the point  so there exorbitantly expensive  your average person can‚Äôt afford the thousands of dollars it costs to access that treatment aaaaand now i‚Äôm just rambling   i‚Äôm so glad you have one doctor you can be completely honest with because that‚Äôs absolutely crucial it sounds like your therapist is amazing i‚Äôm sorry your gp was dickish but at the same time i can understand why he would be concerned about you self medicating your mental health issues with opiates because that‚Äôs a huge indicator of active addiction or that you‚Äôre headed toward active addiction very quickly regardless i‚Äôm super proud of you for having the balls to be honest with your medical team  for trying to get better whatever that looks likei have questions if you don‚Äôt mind when you say your doc didn‚Äôt react well when you told him you‚Äôre essentially self medicating your mental health issues with opiates what exactly happened there because it sounds like you‚Äôve been honest about it with your psych  that doc is at least trying to help you be as safe as possible so what happened with your other doc  what does that one specialize in you mention getting your meds from a pain clinic so is that one your pain mgt doc   secondly when you say your psych prescribed ketamine as a treatment for your depression when was that  how exactly did that go down she just wrote you a script that you filled at your regular ol‚Äô community pharmacy i‚Äôm super curious about this  i‚Äôve never known anyone that managed to get their doctor to get on board with ketamine treatments not even the most severe cases of treatment resistant depression with some of the worst suicidal ideations ever  it‚Äôs incredibly sad tbh   lastly have you  your psych considered ect i know that‚Äôs an extremely drastic last line therapy but when it‚Äôs that or the patient offing themselves or have you tried microdosing psychedelics i‚Äôve heard truly amazing things about the effects of microdosing both lsd  psilocybin  not both simultaneously of course  but i can‚Äôt really speak to that personally because while i‚Äôve tried it with lsd i wasn‚Äôt super consistent  i didn‚Äôt dose volumetrically  i procured the lowest dose tabs i could find they were either 105 or 110 microgram gammagoblin tabs  cut each tab into 16 pieces  ingested one piece the first time  then a piece  a half the second time but with them being on blotter paper there‚Äôs really no way of knowing exactly how many micrograms were on each piece so i really should have gone the volumetric route anyway i say all of that to say that i didn‚Äôt really notice a difference because i was so inconsistent  didn‚Äôt follow any kind of dosing schedule my two doses were months apart but i‚Äôve really been thinking about giving it another go  being consistent with it this time just because i‚Äôve read so much about how helpful it is with treatment resistant depression because like you i‚Äôve been on every antidepressant known to man  nothing has helped at best they just make me into a zombie that makes me easier for everyone around me to tolerate but they don‚Äôt help me feel any better  i‚Äôm so far past being done with making myself into a fucking zombie just so other people are more comfortablebenzos are such a godsend in hospice care especially the longer acting ones when my grandmother was at the end of her fight with cancer she got downright combative  had no idea what was going on around her  she didn‚Äôt even recognize us anymore   the benzo  opioid combo were the only thing that kept her comfortable   also i feel you on the dad thing i lost mine unexpectedly four years ago next month two days after my birthday no one has any idea why because they didn‚Äôt do a full autopsy  they just called it natural causes  left it at that   even though everyone says it gets easier it hasn‚Äôt it still sucks just as much as the day i got the call you aren‚Äôt alone in those feels friend üñ§that‚Äôs a very kind thought thank you this shit with the dea has created a whole new demand for black market opioidsi‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this especially with you being so young   unfortunately the chances of her medical team taking any suggestions from you about which meds to use or doses is pretty much nonexistent i‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs unconscious if so they‚Äôll base their case off of signs of pain like her respiratory rate  any verbal cues  muscle spasms  such there‚Äôs a fine line when someone is opiate naive between properly treating their pain  pushing them over the edge which can lead to a malpractice suit   with that being said your best bet is if you see signs that she‚Äôs uncomfortable like what i mentioned above say something to her nurses the nurses are who will go to bat for her rarely the doctors because they only see her for a few minutes at a time

it is very fun and a good introduction to many of the famous ufologists the boys mention a research heavy alien episode  episode 223 witch hunts this is another one of my all time favorite episodes in regards to a book on witches they only got one page on killing crops but they got 5 pages on stealing penises  stealing penises is really the main theme of this episode let me say it again one of my favorites one of the funniest  episode 239 billy meier this guy is one of the biggest doofuses ever he claims to be be in contact with aliens hes obsessed with cowboys he has one arm no one believes a

compelling it also has henry doing uk accents and some hilarious characters  episode 281282 jerry brudos this guy is such a loser serial killer known as the shoe fetish slayer has a heavy lisp as pathetic as they come   284 travis walton possibly the most accessible alien episode due to hilarious characters and the fact that not much suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy it that is if youre not a believer loggers it turns out are incredible subjects for a character actor that just trucker humor mixed with construction worker humor thats what loggers are truckers mixed with construction workers   and thats all folks the episodes after this im sure anyone could tell you about im gunna have to save this for next time this question is asked as i doubt anyone will see itmy favorite line from this song is i miss her broken china voice  theres so many meanings first off its a great description of a voice rough like shattered glass scratchy but then its also the idea of something beautiful and delicate but totally broken and ruined  then theres the idea of her asking for forgiveness her voice after a fight maybe where she broke the china or maybe it was an accident but now shes asking for forgiveness

,,,Serotogenesis,opioid,keep it under 400mg theres a serotonin aspect to the stuff makes it weird cuz some people think its a bottom tier opioid and others think its the king depending on how they handle that side of the effectsexactly our brains being chemical supercomputers we can tweak with one of a dozen neurotransmitters is so fucking cool  this is gonna sound dumb in this sub but id never actually played with kratom much ive been kinda chilling on a lot of drugs besides weed occasional alcohol ritalin and k but i just discovered my head shop sells kratom at a half decent price and have been loving the dichotomy of low dose being stimmy and high dose scratching that opioid itch  whatve you been getting into lately

,,,SirSaltyThe1st,opiates,thats a really good question and thanks for the feedback  for me personally methadone allowed me to get my life back on track without worrying about scrimping for opiates  i started doing positive productive and creative things again  yes the withdrawals are worse and last longer but i was more prepared for them with hope for the future  i think it depends entirely on your mindsetit was sooo hard mate so freaking hard but it was the best thing ive ever done feels so good to finally be free from those pesky opiates i had a big monkey on my back for a long time  thank you
,,,ben42187,opioid^china^opiates^opiate,i mean bro if youre doing carfentanil no opioid is going to break through that and give you the same feeling its just that simpleas is true in the opioid world as is life all good things must come to an endthe problem with this one is going to be that the precursors to make this are going to be illegal so youre not going to find it widely distributed are made in labs in chinamethadone is not a blocker the reason why it is so hard to break through with other opioids on methadone is because of the strength of methadone i guarantee you asking me iv fentanyl or carfentanil addict if itll break through methadone and it most certainly will you just have to find an opioid with a higher potency and intrinsic activity then methadones man it took me 20 years to realize the opiates are probably the most overrated high there isyeah benzos were great in withdrawal if you want to get addicted to benzos and trade an opiate habit for more hellacious benzo habit ive been an opiate addict for 20 years and i still dont understand why people think that theres a free lunch with opiates there is no free lunch with opioidsi did not taper i cold turkey i was on 50 mg a day for a decade i had had enough and walked out today is day 302 opiate free and ive never felt better and more free once you guys get over your fear and put the clinic behind you in the bulshit you will be too
,,,iammyowndoctor,black^opioid,truth dude i know exactly what youre talking about i mean to be fair eyeballing little amounts is one thing but as im sure you know a lot of dudes seem to be literally trying to max out how much dope they can load in the syringe like you know where they got the plunger 90 back so far you can barely reach it and even worse those fools who judge the strength of a shot by how dark it is like they dont get that the cuts make it dark not the dopewtf lol dumbass who take perfectly good powder and add loads of sugar to it and fry it to make imitation shitty black tar heroin that taste more sugarsweet than heroin bitter  these low down harm reductionestranged dope heads i hung out with in central ohio i mean these guys took the cake for fragrant disregard for all common sense not just safety precautions they reused rigs 10 times shot crack with lemon juice without so much as boiling to sterilize the worst part was it took me almost 2 years to unlearn all the trashy stupid as fuck ways of doing it id learned from these shitheads to be sure not cause they were opiheads only cause they were trashy as living fuck  the crown jewel you believe this ear wax to help get your plunger sliding properly in the barrel of the syringe  thats what my dear junkie buddy the charming sexy af closeted 19 yo supertwink ryan pratt taught me to do as a way of coping with rigs reused to the max ryan who went to rehab out of state every 6 months like you know as the program was set up for regular relapses and detoxes in a perpetual cycle like that huh ryan who cheated me every chance he got ryan who if he ever went to prison would have been the most desired guy in the place over night with tough guys offerring him weed and dope left and right for his love and affection i have no doubt yep i really shouldve gone for him miserable and stupid af as he was   ryan all 120lb of him bragging about how he took a 05g shot last night and didnt od hahaha nevermind the subtext which is if you  ever even feel the tempted to fit 05g iof dope nto a single syringe then your dope is likely weak af it was and dirty af  lol sorry its true though he was like super hot at 56 120 short brown hair and nerdy glasses and whispery dope fiend voice not to mention his dead fucking laugh what a guy he was ryan hes probably dead now anyway shame he didnt learn how to do dope from some smarter dudestheres a dude on ropiates called ucaptainfentanyl who literally does have a permanent iv port for drugs dudes an opioid scientist an expert his comments are proofi know were arent supposed to mention this but thing is i do have personal experience here i shot loads of h meth coke too to an extent and yes ive done h and meth combined in fact thats what i dedicated today to seeing if i could appreciate how these ods occur see ive never oded for whatever reason not in 10 years of doing this on and off  it might be the initial rush with meth and h involves a boosting of the opioid aspect high enough that it over powers the stim effect  ive defimitely still experienced noticeable resp depression with speedballs not to dangerous level i mean so maybe it is possible idk   my last shot for example 25mg meth 40mg heroin this heroin is maybe 4050 pure that provoke a shockingly strong sedative effect i didnt move for a 10 min at the peak but yeah my level of consciousness was enough that i could simply will myself to breathe if i thought it was getting too shallowthats true but with meth and heroin as oppose to coke and heroin the opioid wears off long before the stim not vice versa just saying  so that whole argument which i agree is a great theory delayed overdose cant apply to meth and amp speedballs as well as cokeriver had been mixing dope and coke but its thought that some unknown 3rd drug did him in when it was added to the mix he broke down into convulsions which is definitely a sign of stim od rather than opioid odwell isnt more likely that a good fraction of ods are what you might call semiintentional suicides by which i mean the person likely was depressed and somewhat suicidal and they were dancing with death by taking as much as possible but they werent necessarily set on trying to kill themselves knowing heroin users i think this explanation is more likely in most casespeople just dont give a fuck if they live or not   for the record you nonrecreational opioid users might not know this but it isnt really quite as easy to od even on street heroin as people make it sound i mean the precautions required to prevent od they arent very complicated to follow a monkey could do it but still a huge fraction of users dont have a clue harm reduction is even a thing so loads of lives are lost over basic lack of caution and its chalked up to users just oding cause thats what they do apparently   but yeah thats kind of bullshit oding shouldnt be so normalized with the proper measuring tools and precautions ts extremely easy to avoidi know people dont want to believe it but its truewas it the high potency powder like they sell on the dn or did afaik   cause i got these tiny packages of the most insanely strong powder is ever seen it was so strong you could ingest just a little barely visible speck and get a moderate level fentanyl rush off of it  its a heavy and very peaceful high but its over with so quickly in like 2 hours tops to get you back to baseline and youd get withdrawals as early as 4 hours after taking without redosing it or another opioid  ive never smoked that fent or any other fent thou honestly i suppose there is likely a system out there that could make this more viable  for the moment it would not appear to be a very reliable method of administering fentanyl so i wouldnt try though ive dntr it myself other ways  i would advise you that fent is an extremely fast actually narcotic and that even taken sublingually for example it will kick in with an onset not too far behind what you get snorting or smoking itlmao wow thats hilarious but yes you are just realize you need to ensure that when mixing any drugs that potentiate each otherits vital start by adding in the second 2nd drug at a snails pace with breaks to let it absorb so that you can accurately determine what level of intoxication you can expect after that you can have at least some confidence that the same two drugs will potentiate each in the same way if you take them the same way  for gods sake dont even think about trying to up your established safe max dose unless you have back up in the room with you with narcan handy should the worst happen   just use common sense ok its really not that hard to avoid oding in reality not at allyou can get supremely fucked up and then some before even entering the preod range only dummies who dont check their dope before shooting or try to take a second massively  intense shot of dope after the first one even when they already missing out   in other words dont be a part of this problem if anything please bigotry applies to drugs as much as race gender or any other parameter and opioid related ods are the number one excuse used by hateful assholes to justify treating addicts like subhuman garbage   can you do this for me guy i know you have the smarts promise you arent gonna go and od like you dont have a clue what youre doing tell me youre gonna always take care of these things smart and do your research before making an big decisions on whether to partake and if so with how much okyeah this advice is spot on i know from experience in fact yesterday for only the second time in the last 365 days i scored a relatively large sack large for what i usually spent on it if and when i do which isnt so much anymore as ive realized it isnt very cost effective compared to suboxone or kratom and thus youd likely be a fool to use it anymore than in special occasions like the one im celebrating atmüòâ   it was some refreshingly straight dope though for real just the diamorphine with likely just one innocuous cut a plain white powder with a strongly bitter taste recognizable to me as the unique dark chocolate tang of 4 heroin the hcl salt that is nothing to make me suspect fentanyl and ive had no problems taking more than intended as of yet even though ive been piling it on pretty heavily im cautious to nit leave anything up to chance ive got 7 years of using this stuff to various degrees on and off on my belt and i havent had an incident yet where i required hospitalization for overdosing   it cooked up nice and clear which was a relief as you really do not wanna have colors showing up in your injection solutions ever it always means impurities garbage you wish theyd aint subtracted from the weight of the dope they sold you so you could have totally pure heroin for once  i asked my dealer for 60 worth of heroin this time as well i bought a 20 sack of some of his consistently fire ice its been years since ive bought that much smack in a single sack usually i take suboxone daily which actually gives me a moderate high but since meth comedowns can really suck and id like to give the meth an extended break after this anyway i figure its be cool to have this time at least for the meth comedown which can be a butch  i figured it would be nice for a change to be able to summon the hammer of heroin to smash any uncomfortable sensations into dust its been so long since ive done a year ago at least id almost forgotten what it felt like compared to suboxone turns out its much the same in quality of effect but if course can be more intense in terms of the quantity of effect   anyway good stuff stop hating on heroin for things that are only tangentially related roheroins actual innate properties   like understand that dirty street dope is much worse for you just for being laced with all kinds of bullshit no one asked for understand you dont just accidentally od if youre keeping my a tight tab on your consumption as you should   realize that youve basically been set up to suffer all kinds of negative consequences just for liking opioids by society and those wretched selffulfilling prophecies theyll try to stick you with like when they tell you if you use h at all youre definitely gonna die of an overdose like someone did today you have to do the right thing as i did and tell him to fuck off with the condescending fortune telling and the prophecy of doom   the truth is even with the whole fentrcs situations as bad as it is you can ensure you do not od while using heroin simply applying the proper precautions most ods are not really caused by insanely ovrerpowered fentadope more often than not the victim just adopts this line of reasoning without actually have a real clue what they took but rather than actually being superpowered in the legitimate sense as with something like pure lab grade fentanyl something i had the pleasure to own in minute quantity for 3 short days several years ago   yeah did i mention pure fent is very safe when volumeteically dosed   anyway od victims are lying most of the time when they claimedm they got something resblibf pure fent in the street personally ive never seen anything even close to from my local drug dealer really the strongest ive seen on the streets was a n rc opi that was about on point with pure diamorphine in terms of potency sadly it had a few extrabside effectsmore itching nausea and more of a chance of triggering a headache in high doses than h    the first time i did 40mg if this batch it was with a nice 20mg ice redose i had to wait for the suboxone to flush just a little bit out of my system before i could achieve that super strong opi high subs cant quite reach under any circumstances of course i started small and worked up to gauge how strong my h was  i got to say that shooting a proper speedball done as a rare treat is a really enjoyable and oddly fascinating experience i feel that its bad reputation isnt necessarily deserved its really not at all some inherent death trap like media wont have you think not even close  ill admit that damn for a sec i was actually a bit scared that it was too muchid forgotten what iv heroin felt like more than i knew it turned out that the dose was actually quite safe for being so intensei had no more than trivial respiratory relaxation never lost consciousness it felt in a bizarre way almost like the stim and the opioid together were creating like a kind of anesthetic effect as a third element on top if each of their own you feel like this vortex of dopamine fog swirls up and explodes with this spike of irresistable serenity that swallows you whole its honestly different what from youd expect it to be in many ways   my dealer hooked me up giving me 0450g for my 60 nice considering its 20 per 100mg for small retail samples like id typically buy if i did at all recently before i first came back to for one night a month ago or s  anyway they trial and error i estimate that 40mg of thus dope would constitute   the closest i ever came was when i once passed out in my car in a parking lot while coming home from my dealer having boy tv ht meth and this cruddy rc dope yard to say if it was fent another one it had a weird almost spicy flavor i remember and wasnt all that strong but wasnt totally weak either it was the best i could find at that moent   relatively high purity for street at maybe 4050what it was is a patient committed suicide zoloft got a black box warning for that and still got approved idk why they didnt do the same here frankly obesity is enough of a suicide contributor that the risk likely would have been worth it overall long term23 days of relatively heavy use is the minimum the best thing you can do to prevent it is to make sure you give your body long enough to totally clear the drug after each period of use in order to start to build tolerance you need a constant level of some opioid effect to persist for 3 days straight usually fent wears off fast so it should be easy taking mini tolerance breaks with it
,,,Clipsymuscle,black^opiate,the next thing i remember is titty pulling up to me and barf in his blue truck about half way down boonie‚Äôs street in the middle of the night and yelling at his brother something about his girl and then skidding his tires and skirting off as he drove away i do remember seeing his gf in the car with him so i was confused  next i somehow left wherever i was and ended up back at my house which was about a 25 minute walk from boonie‚Äôs  at this point i was told by my mom that i was standing in the kitchen at around midnight babbling random sentences and words to people whom i thought were standing there in the kitchen with me  apparently i still thought i was with the friends i was with earlier and i repeatedly swore to my mom that they were standing right in front of us  i vaguely remember thinking cigarettes were floating in the pool in the backyard but in the morning when i checked it was only dried leaves i also remember seeing spiders crawling on the pebble ground around the pool and i shined a light on them to see them close up i remember these very vividly black shadow like long legged spiders like a cross between a black widow and a daddy long leg  according to my mom who was the only person home at the time i left at around 2am and she watched me walk to the curb outside of the house and lay down on the curb at the edge of the culdesac she was not so concerned about me because it wasn‚Äôt the first time i had come home in the middle of the night super fucked up saying weird stuff so she brushed it off as me just being blacked out drunk and went back to bed luckily i must‚Äôve been out of delirious fuel at this point and my zombified body fell asleep right at the edge of the driveway  i woke up at the crack of daylight to my neighbor shaking me on the ground  he was saying something along the lines of ‚Äúare you ok‚Äù and he had a look of surprise or distress i think i just walked away and went inside and went into my room and i may have taken a nap during this time but the next thing i remember is when my mom barges in my room and says ‚Äúwere you with barf last night he‚Äôs in the hospital he doesn‚Äôt know his name‚Äù at this point i‚Äôm thinking fuck what the hell and i‚Äôm just trying to piece things together in my head  it really felt like nothing even happened after dollar tree but then i remember walking with him to rite aid and titty pulling up and yelling at us then i say something like where‚Äôs titty and i run to their house which is a half a block away to find titty and barf‚Äôs mom outside looking mean  she asks me what the fuck kind of drugs we did last night  i told her straight up we all took hella benadryl and she doesn‚Äôt believe me  she says they just got back from the er and the doctor pumped barf‚Äôs stomach and he seemed fine to go home but when they got home he started tripping out again  i ask her where barf is and then i hear him talking inside so i run in  i ask him who the fuck are you talking to and he says andrew which is his cousin who lives 70 miles away i calmly tell him andrew‚Äôs not here but he insists that he is sitting right in front of us all in a chair  at this point his mom is freaking out and crying and i ask her where titty is she says asleep in his room and i say something like ‚Äúgood‚Äù  then seeing that i can‚Äôt handle the crying and craziness that was happening in their house i leave and walk or run back to my house frantically to see my mom waiting outside with another neighbor  she‚Äôs freaking out kinda because i probably look crazy and because barf and titty‚Äôs mom is freaking out calling her still  at this point i look and see my step dad‚Äôs truck in the driveway and ask why he‚Äôs home on a friday and my mom and the neighbor both tell me it‚Äôs saturday standing there in disbelief and confusion i reach for my phone in my pocket to no avail i reach in my other pocket for my wallet which is gone too along with my mind i must‚Äôve lost all my shit also    i must‚Äôve went back inside at this point when i realize i probably hadn‚Äôt called my girlfriend in a really long time which was a pretty big deal back then  i grabbed my house phonethis was 2009 i called her and she was of course pissed that i had been ‚Äúignoring‚Äù her  i swiftly snapped back at her and made the accusation that she had not called me whilst remembering that i still had no idea where my phone was she hung up on me and i called her back and said ‚Äúi‚Äôll be right there‚Äù before she hung up again i quickly half skated half ran to her house almost falling multiple times and when i got there she was pissed  she started crying and asked if i was cheating on her  i said no and just told her i took some pills from dollar tree and got really fucked up and that barf was in the hospital  she knew all of the people we were with thursday night and tittys‚Äôs gf bones was a good friend of hers  she wasn‚Äôt really buying the story so i told her i would take her out to lunch to make up for it we decided to go to the beach first very bad idea the benadryl trip was yet to be over  so we live near san francisco about a 30 minute drive we smoked a blunt and drove into the city and parked near the embarcadero which is right off the bridge  i took a nap on the way being still super tired and along with the weed we smoked i was starting to feel the effects of the benadryl again  we decided to take the muni transit busses and trains down to ocean beach so we got on the first train which was a really loud rackety ride  somehow during this ride i thought my cousin alex was with us and this really freaked my gf out because she thought i was joking at first  his continued except it rotated through different people from people i was with the night before to people i hadn‚Äôt seen in ages i saw them in the flesh right there with me on the bus  i absolutely positively believed they were there and saw them with my own eyes or mind  this is the most scary thing that‚Äôs ever happened in my life  when we got to the beach it only got worse  the sounds of the crashing waves the sounds of the wind the people talking in the distance  all of these sounds transmitted through the sound waves and into my brain as voices of people i knew friends family members  it‚Äôs like i saw them there in my mind or felt their presence without physically seeing them  a very odd unmatched feeling  my girl had to be super freaked out at this point and i must‚Äôve done some shit that i can‚Äôt even imagine that day    i only remember bits and pieces about what happened after this but i do remember that barf and titty‚Äôs mom cut them off from me but titty and i remained friends for a few more years  barf never forgave me apparently he too was talking to people he thought were in his house for the remainder of the day also he never touched drugs again after this day not even weed  i went on to try massive amounts of acid shrooms ketamine and dxm but nothing compares personally as far as entering another dimension or dream world for me one of the craziest drugs in the world right there on the shelf for a dollar what the fuckyou probably won‚Äôt die from heroin or other hard opiate withdrawal but you will want to and you will feel dead inside once you come down fentanyl is a whole ‚Äònother monster unless you

,,,shalean,opioid^china^black,was it prescribed  but either way it‚Äôs better to obtain these drugs legally so you know what your taking is legit rather getting stuff that is cut or these pressed 30s it would be a great society if the government could completely stop access unless for severe medical issues but that isn‚Äôt the case and most likely it will never ever happen we‚Äôve learned that with alcohol prohibition and the marijuana laws  and i‚Äôm not saying that these laws are inherently racist today but it started with an explicit bias towards black and mexicans and the entire world followed the america‚Äôs steps after these drugs became illegal look it up man and tell me why either crack epidemic so many african americans got locked up but now with the opioid epidemic ‚Äú which consists mainly of white people explain why they aren‚Äôt getting incarnation the same rate it because when these laws were coming in to place they knew blacks made up the urban areas where they purposely over policed   portugal‚Äôs decriminalization proves that having it decriminalized is inherently safer then having it be illegal your argument doesn‚Äôt make senseik this probably would never happen but if the government made safe injection sites they can also have a testing facility there to test how pure your product is what the drug is and identify any kind of harmful cut in there that‚Äôs what i honestly meant by legalization not just being able to walk in a gas station and say hey can i get a gram of fat china white haha but i think we‚Äôre both on the same page when we want this to be a medical issue not a criminal onei obviously don‚Äôt think that it should be legalized and sold with ease but they could have alternatives too that aren‚Äôt as strong for example codeine is legal otc in some countries with decriminalization we could have safe injection sites like the do in canada instead of the government spending money on law enforcement could be used to spread education open up clubsinjection sites so people can inject with someone near them to use narcan in case  i‚Äôm not saying that these drugs laws were inherently made to be racist but the fact is crack carried a way heavier sentence and everyone knew who was using crack poor black americans this was what only 1520 years after jim crow was overruled i just think that we‚Äôve been trying this method for decades now and it hasn‚Äôt been working at all again i don‚Äôt mean full blown legalization but they should have lighter sentences  the justice system here is fucked up man let me give you an example that‚Äôs actually really close to home with me my girlfriends mother was raped and chokedbeaten badly she had the whole rape kit and everything done by the book had his dna basically everyone knew he was fucked he got a sentence of five years as long as he plead guilty like seriouslyim not gonna sit here and say ‚Äúi know people that got locked up for selling weed and get a heavier sentence‚Äù which i haven‚Äôt only ever seen people get probation for that but with some harder drugs i‚Äôve heard people go 20 years 10 years etc etc way worse of a sentence then this fucking rapists got and this guy had priors he had a dui and an assault and battery car in my opinion i don‚Äôt think someone who soldtrafficked drugs should ever get a sentence that‚Äôs worse then rape i get that selling drugs is immoral but it‚Äôs definitely in that weird grey area compared the black and white situation of rape where you know that person only had disgusting and an evil intent  i think we both agree on that drugs should be a medical issue not a criminal issue of course if the person is only a user and yeah i also agree that race isn‚Äôt the entire reason but the fact that it even had to do with such laws is fucked up even if it‚Äôs only 10 race should‚Äôve never been a factor in this no matter how big or small even socio economic status shouldn‚Äôt be a factor deciding if a person will be spending time in a jail or if you get a good lawyer you can just get put on probation we need better public defenders better laws and more care and empathy for our citizens for going through the trrrible disease of addictionmy man that was a great read i‚Äôm gonna sound like a weirdo but honestly great text and use of words but i whole heartedly agree with you prohibition was originally built off of racism with reefer madness and too this day our gov officials still think it‚Äôs a great idea despite the repeated failures and not only in our country but latin ameirica mainly mexico still

,,,KingxxxBoom,black^opiates^dreams,sorry for your loss i had a friend overdose 2 days ago on fentanyl and i was able to save his life due to my quick action in calling 911 i‚Äôve smoked fentanyl for a bit with him prior and i can say the drug itself is very addicting much more than heroin imo the high is short but very intense and can be something that‚Äôs very psychologically grasping on ones mind quitting it very hard and it‚Äôs a really easy drug to binge on after a bit you start to get sick and hurt physically too depending on what you‚Äôre getting street wise you can never be actually sure how much fentanyl you are getting in this case it‚Äôs really easy to get excited and do more than you are usually tolerated too it catches up to you eventually and when you overdose it‚Äôs too late you lose total consciousness and black out where your breathing then stops and eventually you die everyone has their reasons for doing it and i‚Äôm sure your dad didn‚Äôt want to end his life the drug is a monster in my eyes hopefully this gives a little insight to the drug and how it affects peoplei was scared for my freedom at first as well but in my head my best friends life was more important than any trouble we‚Äôd face so i made that call and confidently helped the cops help me i‚Äôve been using opiates on and off for 3 years from hydros to heroin and i‚Äôve used fentanyl before my friend had popped the half and smoked the one with me i didn‚Äôt overdose but that was his mistake taking that half i believe i‚Äôm glad you made it out after taking that bar it‚Äôs pretty disturbing to see all this fentanyl going around everywhere hope it will all just endthank you definitely not doing anymore opiates this experience was more than enough of a push to keep me away from doing any more my friend says the sameit‚Äôs almost a dizzying feel in your head and warmth everywhere your eyes get lazy and you nod off like crazy while having these weird waking dreams i‚Äôve only smoked h though not worth trying though really addictive in my opinionwhen my friend overdosed it was on fentanyl similar to heroin but much much stronger i blacked out for at least 20 minutes and somehow woke up while he was unconscious he couldn‚Äôt wake up i did everything in my power to try but he was lifeless when the cops and ambulance came to revive him they used narcan nasal spray to stop the opiates he woke up hurting sick and confused during the overdose he was grunting for breaths but it‚Äôs just nothing once you‚Äôve blacked out i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs peaceful but you‚Äôll never know what happened right after the dose i don‚Äôt condone ever using it to kill ones self though the off chance you wake up it‚Äôs not gonna be pretty you could wake up with brain damage having to be on life support for the rest of your life it‚Äôs like gambling you just don‚Äôt know
,,,stondddd,chocolate^opiate,jesus turned water into wine and you turned shrooms into chocolate not saying your jesus or anything but i personally don‚Äôt know you so i think you should look into itas a former opiate addict i‚Äôm thinking he knew he was most likely facing some time and wanted to atleast go to jail high as fuck tons of my friends have ate drugs when they got pulled over back when i was bad on pills i can see myself taking 12 more pills then usual but an intentional overdose even if your hoping they‚Äôd take you to a hospital before jail or give you special treatment or whatever it is just isn‚Äôt worth it this all seems like he made a bad choice and ended up overdosing overdosing on oxy or codeine alone is one thing but mixing them together could cause a seizure as for how he got narcanned and didn‚Äôt come out of it is beyond me but he must have taken way too high of a dosei know but i‚Äôll be honest oxycodone and me have a love hate relationship i‚Äôve been addicted and i‚Äôve gotten out of it more then i can remember currently it‚Äôs hard to get actual oxycodone with all the fentanyl so i usually take kratom   that being said it was my birthday and i was only planning on dropping acid went to meet up with the plug and he gifted me an unknown dose of the 4 aco dmt i had tried it before and was confident enough that i could have 10 drops of it and that would equal about an eighth of shrooms he gave me 6 drops and also had some oxycodone for cheaper then usual so i took him up on that  i‚Äôve mixed oxycodone with lsd before and it‚Äôs not worth it it kills the visuals pretty good and takes you out of the fun lsd headspace and instead your in more of a ‚Äútrippy opiate fog‚Äù in hindsight i wish i would have just done the acid and shrooms because it would have been so much more memorable and i‚Äôd actually have a good story worth telling   the biggest downside was at 4am i decided i‚Äôd lay down and try to get some sleep i rack up a large line of oxy enough i felt confident that it would make me nod out if it wasn‚Äôt for the lsd stimulation i snort the line and as soon as it hit me i got the worst brain zaps in my fucking life worst headache migraine whatever the fuck your want to call it but i swear to god i was counting the seconds and it lasted an hour on the dot never ever doing that again and my homie also reported brain zaps on oxy and shrooms
,,,bigpoppa979,opiates^opiate,depends on what you‚Äôre taking and how long the physical withdrawal are short and most likely the least of your concern if you have been taking stronger meds the psych symptoms are the worst part of it and that took me 45 months to get over and i‚Äôm still not 100 you will likely need meds to help ease off due to long term use i use cymbalta and gabapentin but some use ssri and or benzo‚Äôs the anxiety is crippling when you quit because every emotion youve been suppressing with opiates comes back magnified times 10 when i quit the panic attacks were so bad i thought my brain was broken it does give better but only with time the right people around you and a will to stay sober9 days now how are you feeling i‚Äôm in same boat i‚Äôm on day 4 going off 13 year opiate addiction are you doing well
,,,vanderbolts,dreams,same i never have pleasant dreams if im lucky theres just something weird going on if im not which is most of the time something is chasing me or trying to kill or harm me in some way the earliest dream i can remember was two guys breaking into my house and trying to kidnap me when i was about four years old
,,,burf2500,opiates^opiate^black,i have to be totally honest and say that i got addicted to benzos from taking them recreationally but the fact that there were so many floating out there from prescriptions or people getting them online made it way too easy ive dealt with all the same issues youve mentioned and ive actually been addicted to opiates as well and i can say without a doubt that benzos are much more debilitating and the withdrawal is much worse  longer the word needs to get out there how vile these things are because they dont have the reputation that opiates doi always love hearing from old timers hope you dont mind that term it must be hard having to go through this struggle later in life because im turning 40 in a month and a half been doing opiates since i was 25 just now at the tail end of coming off suboxone after 12 years and it feels like a lifetime already most people i know cycle between using and being clean through jail or rehab so to be hooked on opiates for 12 years has really made me almost forget what its like to be free of them getting off opiates is hard in itself but i know the real battle is staying clean long term that voice will always be in your head trying to convince you that you can use just the right amount and for me thats really a tough struggle because for the first few years i did opiates i managed to do so only once or twice a week it was all fun and games no tolerance not much money spent and no withdrawals to run from but i know those days are long gone because the addiction progressed just like everybody said it would   funny you mentioned how your generation tried to change things because i was just watching james taylor on the late show talking about that too i think the 60s did bring a lot of change most of it for the good but i also think it normalized drugs a little more some things dont change though and it seems like our country and the world really go in cycles this opioid crisis is a complete nightmare right now there are a lot of factors but i think the biggest is the pharma industry pushing painkillers in the 90s and early 2000s i got started popping pills from injuries and surgery and then scoring them from other people most people dont all of a sudden decide to try heroin one day but popping a pill doesnt seem out of the ordinary because everybody takes some kind of pill now theres more awareness about painkillers but back in the early 2000s when i started taking them there wasnt quite the stigma that there is now i think there has been a lot of advancement with treatment suboxone is a good step forward and the aca gave a lot of addicts insurance which is required to cover addiction treatment the insurance i used to have through my job didnt cover addiction treatment which is ridiculous i just hit 5 years clean and it trips me out how i want to stay clean as bad as i wanted to get high back in the day anyway i hope you get to where you want to beits a potent drug and even 25mg is more than you think it is the good thing is coming off such a small dose your withdrawals might not last that long so after 48 hours things could start to get better soon you could always start skipping days of taking it and increase the days you dont take it each week kratom can help but dont go too crazy with it because even though its not a true opiate it still acts on your opiate receptors and can hold back your healing if dont already have clonidine get some off that imodium with the stomach cramps and withdrawals all around and there are a ton of herbal remedies that can help you sleep and calm your anxietyi completely agree heroin and methadone withdrawal are the only times ive really considered offing myself just to end the misery suboxone can be rough but nothing like a full agonist with a short half life another reason i think people say suboxone is harder detox from is its the only opiate that theyve ever completely come off of not many people go through the full detox process from heroin or other opiates as they usually go on suboxone instead of pushing through a while back i was using hydrocodone to come off 6mg of suboxone and while it helped i still felt the sub withdrawals once i got through a couple weeks i decided it was time to stop the hydro and even though that stuff isnt strong the withdrawal was insane my legs were so restless they were almost flailing around involuntarily and i wanted to saw them off so yeah short acting opiates are brutal since your body doesnt have time to adjust to them coming out of your systemdo not do it with benzos any little bit you take for relief you will feel later on any little bit ive been addicted to opiates and with them you have some leeway to screw up and if you take some extra it wont affect you a whole lot but with benzos its a whole different story you have to be extremely regimented and stick to the program no matter what a few times ive taken a half mg or so of valium and even that little amount will cause problems later on if you really need a break just wait for the withdrawals to mellow out and then stay at the dose youre taking for a few weeksyour body will always heal im down to 1mg of suboxone when i was on 24mg at one point and i can already feel my endorphins  comin back music sounds better food tastes better and i have a sense of well being i havent had in a long time it will take a while for you to get back to normal after 5 plus years of doing opiates but it will happen life might seem a little bland being clean but thats a separate issuenice little variety pack that stuff on the left is super dark black and looks good last time i did tar it had fent in it and while it got me super high i just dont like that crap its super sketchy what i dont get is most people dont like fent so why do the cartels put it in the dope its probably cheaper and makes for a stronger highyoull get there a month may seem like a long time but when youre talking about a long acting opiate like suboxone its not surprising you still feel off id say within the next couple weeks youll start to feel better and by the end of month two youll be doing a lot better maybe even close to normal thats a high dose to jump from which takes longer to heal from exercise if you can eat well and drink lots of water  im on 115mg right now and considering just jumping from it because i never feel well even if i stay at the same dose for a while i dont know how i can get any lower when im already feeling crappy so part of me feels like i need to just bite the bulletyour right and ive had all kinds of crap happen never had allergies bad before benzos and now theyre horrible i get acid reflux bad super fatigued i worry about things constantly and never really feel at ease i forget stuff ive dealt with opiate addiction for years and i can say without a doubt that benzos are not only harder to come off but they also affect your health a lot more when i was just on opiates i loved a pretty normal life i worked exercised had a social life but all that changed after benzos hopefully the body is as resilient as everybody says and we can heal from all this stuffim so fortunate to have the coolest doctor a person could ask for hes a recovering addict not from opiates but just about everything else so he can sympathize what im going through hell write me a script for whatever version of sub i want has written me a replacement script when my other one got damaged by water and even called the pharmacy to give me early refills to be honest he used to be a candyman doctor and would load addicts up with all kinds of good stuff im guessing because he figured if they could get high off their medication they wouldnt do dope one guy i knew used to get 400mg of extended release morphine a day before that it was 90mg of methadone 3mg of klonopin and adderall but the medical board came down on him and now he can only prescribe suboxone i could go on and on about cool things hes done for me but there bottom line is he saved my life when i was a desperate strung out heroin addict and now ive been clean for over 5 years he says its rewarding for him and i believe since hes in the na scene and likes to give back on the flip side he can be a loose cannon and is super moody thats great you found a doctor thats willing to make things easier for you my philosophy and im pretty sure my doctors too is that if you make recovery and being on suboxone as convenient as possible it will encourage you to stay clean and keep living a normal life i also feel a debt to my doctor and that i owe it to him to stay clean after how cool hes been to me do your best to keep that doctor and always do the right thing btw i dont get this great that addicts will abuse plain buprenorphine its been proven that people can inject suboxone without getting withdrawals and buprenorphine just isnt a drug that is really good for abusing ive abused a lot of stuff but never buprenorphine and ive gotten every form of it at some pointive never been to jail for more than a day before i even had an opiate habit but some of the stories i hear blow my mind how callous the jail personnel are there was a girl who died in my town from dehydration even though she was desperately trying to get help and ive heard the same story happen all over the country if you have a prescription i dont know why they wont just let you take it or at least do a taper its more dangerous for them because it puts your health at risk and if they think it teaches you a lesson thats not true because most people just start taking an opiate again once they get outsome people say they feel better on subs but im not sure if they mean instead of using other opiates or being in withdrawals i find it hard to believe that anybody feels better on suboxone than they did before they were on any opiate period everybody is different though when i say i feel better on a lower dose its a bit of a mixed bag i do feel crappy and worn out from withdrawals but i also have feelings of well being music sounds awesome im not as fatigued im regular stuff like that its going to suck to a certain degree coming off suboxone and you have to give it a while before your body healsive noticed the music thing too as ive gotten to lower doses of sub and when ive detoxed back in the day once your endorphins and dopamine start flowing again you can enjoy things a lot more ive noticed food tastes a lot better too both of those chemicals basically make you feel good and when youre hooked on opiates your body stops producing them by the way as far as alice in chains go i like all their stuff but a couple songs that really stand out that dont get much play are got me wrong and nutshelljust a note on vivitrol i took a medication called revia that has naltrexone when i was in rehab and it gave me super bad anxiety the doctor said that it can block some of your bodys natural opiate like chemicals like endorphins and give you anxiety i stopped taking it and felt better a lot of people do fine on vivitrol and revia though  must be hard to stay clean in baltimore that place is world renowned for having the most ample supply of heroin and good quality too good job on your clean time things should keep getting bettersounds like youre going through post acute withdrawal itll get better with time but it definitely lingers longer than the acute phase it also sounds like youre just starting to learn how to live life clean which takes time also but it will happen as long as you work for it no matter how much your mind tries to tell you that life was better on opiates its a lie and complete bullshitprobably not that high but i would always take benzos excessively if i had access to them i actually abused them for about 10 years recreationally but never had any issues with physical addiction because i never had a consistent supply now i will never touch a benzo again for a few reasons theyre highly addictive and the withdrawals are complete hell once youve been hooked on them its easy to get physically addicted again and most of all i cant control how much i take of them and will pop as many as i can get my hands on until im a blacked out slobbering mess they have legit medical uses and if a person can take them responsibly then thats great but i still think theyre extremely dangerous its also easy to blur the lines of addiction because theyre a prescription pill that do help with certain issues same thing with opiates great for killing pain short term but highly addictivean old school guy at an na meeting told me one time the monkey on your back never dies it just sleeps and waits somehow ive managed to stay clean from all substances including heroin for 5 years and dont have the obsession to get high like i used to but im also on a low dose of suboxone and know if i got a prescription for painkillers it could be the start of a serious downhill dive there were a couple of old timers in the na scene that had 10 plus years clean that fell off and hard its a shitty cross to bear always worrying about relapsing but thats the way the cookie crumbles any addict can stay clean if they do the work and really want it though and if you slip up just keep moving on and dont let it turn into a full on run where you have to worry about withdrawals   you did the whole suboxone detox right i have nothing against maintenance and was on suboxone for 12 years myself but if you really want to be clean off opiates then using sub for a short term detox is the way to go sounds like it was a rough ride but you hung with it and now youre free from the opiate ball  chain good job on your accomplishments

,,,OmATIRix,black^chocolate,people should be allowed to take drugs because its not harming anyone besides the user so its basicly a crime without victim adults can make their own decision wheather they want to take drugs or not it doesnt even matter if drugs are illegal people make their choice either way  criminalizing people for something that shouldnt be a crime in the first place only forces users to keep their use a secret which leads to problematic consume patterns and makes people afraid to get help  the black market also fuels organized crime and in some parts of the world even terrorism drugs on the black market are also way more dangerous than they need to be  who would od on fent if drugs werent cut with it who would od on heroin if it was the same potency everytime  making drugs illegal only creates additional problems without adressing the real problems drugs can cause  people who struggle with addiction or are suffering from their drug use need help not a lawsuit  people who want to roll on molly every now and then need to be educated about safer use and dosage and need to know how strong the pills are or if they even contain mdma  legalizing all drugs wont solve the problems that come with drugs but it will solve the problems caused by prohibition  tldr legalize all drugschocolate is easy to make  just decarb youre bud and crush it as fine as possible then boil some water in a big pot and put a smaller pot in the water melt chocolate in the smaller pot then mix youre bud with the chocolate and fill it in a mold then just let it cool and harden out in the fridge and enjoy

,,,WestMichiganDabKing,opiate,i say just suboxone kratom is good and all dont get me wrong but imo its for substituting the dope while subs are for getting off of opiods period  i am an exheroin addict and a current suboxone patient i tried to use kratom to get off the boy but all it would do is kinda satisfy the physical craving but nothing for my mental addiction to the high suboxone on the other hand this has worked for me  ive never been to the methadone clinic and this is my first time being on suboxone from what ive been told and read buprenorphine active opiate in suboxone has a ceiling effect where you can only feel so high from it also it sends your tolerance through the roof so that other opiates wont work  now take all of what i said with a grain of salt because this is just what ive heard from my doc and other suboxone patients and someone who knows way more about subs will probably read this and think im an idiot  what ive found though is this the right dose of suboxone will stop the physical craving help immensely with the mental craving and also serve as a safety blanket that blocks other opiates from working even if you tried to use them its a lifesaver

,,,blorgbots,opiates^black^china,youre right but considering what hes actually saying if anything the difference between weed and opiates makes his point more validblack pill is the understanding that genetics are 100 of romance and attraction and thus some people just never had a chance with the opposite sex  doomer is a general lack of hope in yourself and the world often coupled with the knowledge both that you could improve yourself and that you wont put in the effort  its hard to have both because often doomers realize that they could be better  why do i know all these distinctions between internet phrases i dont know manalso theres a ton of circumstantial evidence that sweet drinks help and i think theres even a study or two not enough to truly confirm that black pepper helps tooi already knew rush was a piece of trash but id only heard clips of some of his political beliefs and the terrible shit he said about addicts while being one himself  after he got this medal i finally did research and realized just how fucking awful he is a piece of trash is a guy that kicks an annoying kid rush is that fucking statesized dump in china improbably floating on that trash island in the pacific

,,,chasingd0pamine,opioid^black^opiates^opiate,i guess the real benefits never come if you have chronic pain or something that calls for medication that isnt a real opioid every recovery is diff and mine would be significantly less beneficial or successful at all if i pulled my pain med and lost my life quality just to be clean and free c it‚Äôs still a drug of addiction we‚Äôre still opioid addicts on buprenorphine if you think you aren‚Äôt go cold turkey  its a medication i am dependent on my bupe not engaging in addictive behaviors on it some people have issues like chronic pain nd need these drugs its no diff than many other drugs for legit health conditionslol well i went into a walmart in the hood with running partner at tbe time  we were the only two non black ppl in the store i intended to just look for another carseat for the dboy wbho needed one but running partner rp said hey lets go look at tv i was like o god   we found a 43vizio smart tv that had no spider wrap put in cart also charmin ultra soft tp and cosmic brownies there was no greeter by the door and rp said lets do a walkout  i was walking behind him pushing the cart while he stayed ahead looking around to see if we looked clear i almost aborted the mission but said fuck it nd followed him out the door  the run to the car was a rush i couldnt believe i pulled it off we tried to pawn the tv but the pawn shop wouldnt take it bc it had no cable box hookup so we kept it for 2 weeks until one night high af on dope and dxm we randomly traded it to some random dboy who came to pick it up at 1am got 100worrh of dope for it wish i kept tv in retrospecti will always be passionate about drugs  namely opiates  but i have to switch into a mindset where i‚Äôm passionate about helping fellow addicts who are questioning if they‚Äôll ever truly be able to get clean like me  you can imo remain passionate about the other side of it still  because harm reduction helping people who are gonna use no matter what do it as safely as possible is just as helpful and lifesaving as helping those questioning getting cleanour view seems a little short sighted im actually a neuroscientist working on developing a non opioid pain medication if we had one available would you take it and come off the bupe   yes i would take the time to properly taper off but yes absolutely i would   because i know in my heart that i am over my opioid abuse days my next run will kill me and im not okay with that i truly believe i would make the transition after tapering off and that so long as i kept working my recovery i  would keep my counter of time off full agonists growing   your pain is worse when you dont have the opioid as a means to trick you into continuing to take it  even if this is true what do i do when i dont have it andi  literally cant stand to get out of bed without immediately grabbing a cane and knee brace im fucking 26 what will my real adult life be even if it was in my head it is real i have a real limp i do really fall when my knee pops if i walk without a brace i do have nerve pain that makes me cry sometimes i do have to clutch the railing climbing stairs i think these problems are in the injury in my leg not my head but either way they are real and problematic  but i predict that addicts will lie and say the pain drug doesnt work for their pain just so they can keep on their opioid thats how powerful opioids are  i agree many will but i would give itan honest shot being on bupe forever is not ideal i dont want this for myself i didnt choose this injury bu ti have have for a decade since i was 16 and always will and it will worsen as i age im already a proud owner of  osteo arthritis and ra is hereditary for me but my doc said my injury will likely set it off years prior to when it wouldve on its own   if someone is on an opioid chronically you literally cannot trust anything they say regarding that compound from a scientific standpoint  this just isnt true ive run out of my suboxone for weeks at a time a few times i stuck it out i didnt seek full agonists i didnt even want them i just had like no quality of life and couldnt function despite trying to like honestly trying i was offered oxy to take the edge off and refused it i dragged myself around the house useless but opiate free instead so i went back on the suboxone because it works for me i need something that works for me now im open to other options though im looking into ket infusions its not like  i love being on bupe and chose this life for myself but by choosing bupe i chose life at the time  when i did need mat    we cannot trust chronic opioid users in our study because they lie we have to test the new pain drug on post surgery patients that havent been on opioids before  this is bullshit they can lie too lmao as  dr house says everyone lies you cant trust anyone then really only the results not the words if thts how you feelugh this recovery isnt black and white or one size fits all approaching it that way will always fail ultimately   for me i  have severe chronic pain and choose subs as a compromise  i sacrifice pain control vs full agonist  bc my recovery needs equal attention as my pain condition  i get a lot of shade for this and its unfair some ppl need meds for x reason and csn still work recovery on themfirstly im not a guy  and ive never claimed im clean im clean from full agonist opiates and my drug abuse but never claim to be clean guy i do take medications for legitimate conditions i dont brag about the rc benzos i take which i do take in place of a script i used to get ive been prescribed benzos for my bpd and my anxiety disorder since 2013 but this actually isnt relevent  at all on a post about pain  recovery i was listing my pain meds not  every single medication i put in my body not that its your business worry about your own recovery not my meds last i recall i never hired you as my doctor  dont worry about itopioids are like an allergy for me  i cannot use them responsibly or without negative consequences  ya thats how full agonists are for me i can only handle bupe  it is possible to manage chronic pain without opiates it‚Äôs hard and uncomfortable at times but it‚Äôs worth it to be free from that which once enslaved me i wish you all luck in your journey  one day after i was off the bupe a while maybe but what do i do in the meantime not work sleep walk stand have any quality of life   its already hard and uncomfortable on a partial agonist at times so i assume it would be that at all times on nothing   for me its not worth it to be free im ok with a medication enslaving me if it allows me to have life quality im 21mo free of my doc heroin  and all full agonists but i stay on the bupe and i think it will remain part of my journeyi dont think anyone needs to be on buprenorphine its not a good pain drug its really not i study pain and partial agonists are not as effective at relieving pain  its a good pain drug for me and so what you recommend i go back on a full agonist i left full agonists to save my life    anyway i dont believe that anyone needs buprenorphine   again 1 ppl like me it works for some you might not think i need it but i do and youre not my doctor so your opinion isnt really releveant to that here   its not like addicts have an opioid deficiency in their brain and need opioids to function buprenorphine just eliminates the seeking and the cost  yes maintenance stepping stones crutches for those who need them for chronic relapsers for those who would die without mat  lets give them another opioid that they cant overdose from tell them its medication get them to stay on it forever and  great idea steve  it is medication it is just often misused and misprescribed and most ppl dont stay on for life its not ideal in majority of situations but i agree with the flaw in system this is why i write custom tapers for ppl here  because their doctors are not helpful and other resources have failed themwell since this is an opiate recovery page to me clean means off any opiates partial antagonist or full doesn‚Äôt matter    doesn‚Äôt mean i wasn‚Äôt addicted to an opiate it doesn‚Äôt mean i wouldn‚Äôt have scraped scrounged and done whatever it took if my supply was cut off  you were dependent on a medication but if you wouldve done all that then yea your experience falls into addiction to it   for me when i‚Äôm physically addicted to something that‚Äôs going in my body to the point of ‚Äúif i don‚Äôt take this  i will go through withdrawals‚Äù sorry but that counts in my book   so people who take anti depressants count in your book bc abruptly stopping ssris produce withdrawals too   otherwise i‚Äôm just fooling myself into thinking i‚Äôve got it ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù  and that‚Äôs just ridiculous  its possible to manage yourself and your life while taking a medication i have been doing it for almost two years    as far as the rest i get it   opiates make my life unmanagable too but so does my chronic pain which is why i compromise and take bupei got banned from venmo for once letting some girl give me some of thoise stolen card numbers to send her money and i got a percentage i once had a manager at work ask me to keep my phne camera recording as i swipe cards and hold the card over the cam to catch the numbers while i grabbed their receipt off so that he could do the card fraud i said fuck no but that was back when i was on opiates functionally for myy pain as prescribed not a junkie yetyoure back on ogp for future reference but thoughts always welcome here too   speaking on suboxone i did not get any recreation when i induced this time around in the past yes this time no i felt normal and have been working recovery and managing pain since ive never heard of amphetamine assisted weaning thats nuts there is tbe risk you mention but ppl who are serious bout recovery and who go on mat and come off it the right way can find success and often do it saves so many lives   cannabis and psychedelic based treatment might work for a handful of years at most if at all the mixed results we do have and the sheer lack of medical studies just dont show much promise   thats x more years a person is off dope x more years a person lives i think that is promising   the problem with all of what you mentioned above is its all med based meds alone wont cure you gotta work recovery too gotta work on personal growth your physical and mental health goals rebuilding recovering etc   agree about rehab usually doesnt stick   federal decriminalization or legalization of illicit substances is just a hail mary resort its a 5050 toss up  50 percenr is better than 0 that many more lives potentially saved that many more ppl out of the system for nonviolent drug crimes   legalization wont stop black market fentanyl  itll help some people esp if mixed with regulation like get your drugs at the pharmacy like alcohol and itll help pain patients who are only on the black market bc of this mess   may have quit using but they never remedy the depression anxiety andor psychosis that they are left with which results in not only relapse but suicide and permanent existential dissatisfaction  thats bc you have to put in tbe work quitting alonedoesnt solve the problemhmm ok ill try it could always try both  i have nerve damage from my broken femur and that pain makes me cry sometimes nerve pain is the worst pain there is and now i see why people say nothing compares to a toothache sometimes   im gonna have to find something monday   and yea thats why i asked about the epsom salt bc epsom salt draws out infection no absesss or anything rn tho fingers crossed i dont want any pain pills or anything im on suboxone and wont take opiates even if they gave them to me i just want this out of my fucking mouth   thanks for the advice man appreciate itright i gotcha well i get it in a way opiate use kinda really is a big deal why not hang around methadone and suboxone clinics and find friends there lol

,,,Slanglie,opiate^opiates^opium^opioid,looks like some type of diphenhydramine mixed with pipenol interesting  clearly sarcasm before all the opiate nazis march in ready to exterminate any non expertswhich is about a year  which is the same exact time when this chem and another opiate were brand new on the market and a vendor mixed the two up and many users got the other drug instead   my guess is thats where all this panic and fear mongering stems fromok that chances things alot 20 days isnt long however its not a get out of jail card  so you wont be facing the full wrathe of a long term methadone withdrawal but you will still face more than 72 hours  youve been taking a substance with a 2448 he halflife for two weeks your brain has had a non stop stream of metbadone in it for two weeks its going to withdraw  i cant give you a time line because i truly dont know but i would say at least a week and a half or  two weeks and paws can still  be 6 months or even more insomnia could be 6  months but those are my best guesses  and benzos will definitely be a godsend but dont take it multiple times a day everyday then youll be dependant on an even worse substance with deadly withdrawals save it for when 5he withdrawals are the worst taking them every 3 days should be enough to keep you from becoming dependant it would be great to spend the whole 2 weeks blacked out but itll put you in a situation worse than methadone withdrawal fight the urge to dose daily forreal bro bemzo withdrawal is hell and much worse than opiatesmorphine oral bioavailability it 10 you eat 100 mgs of morphine only 10 are reaching your brain  youre literally throwing money away sure opium latex has many active alkaloids including codeine that is orally active but morphine is the strongest and in highest concentrations  vaporiitze it if your ableat the clinics they preach sobriety in order to phase up and allow yourself to get extra take homes to come to the clinic less clinics do not and should not make you test dirty to get on methadone you could have spent the last 3 months in jail and been clean but knew everytime you left jail you went and used so methadone might be a solution for cravings they wouldnt turn away a non positive testing opiate user i wss 3 months sober when i got on methadone hes lying to you sadly and for that im sorry for the pain and mistrust  they dont want you to piss dirty they give resources and meet with you and do what they can so that you dont piss dirty and therefore they incentive clean uas with extra take homes which means less chaos in your daily life of having to go to the clinic daily and the liquid handcuffs people speak ofgood to know thanks thats what id guess im only curious anyways im in recovery on maintenance i take methadone and have been off illicit opiates for a long time it was merely curiousityif i had some i would but i dont buy or use opiates anymore was merely curious pussyok so it sounds like its doable and also not saying you but people seem to think that how much a chemical burns is its causticity causticity is how damaging to the body it is  if you plan to im it and it was caustic it would damage skin tissue all around the skin pop so if so  iv would be no different    otherwise it sounds effect effect effectwise  and sounds able to be done with benecial effects  but yes  no imperical data and lots of fear mongering and the fact thst at the begining  people werent even receiving the right opioid that other one they were getting  could be the caustic one for all we know

see repeated hundreds of times here bupe does not ‚Äúrip‚Äù oxy or heroin or anything else off your opioid receptors an oxy molecule binds to you receptor for less than 1 second then releases and recirculates to either be metabolized or bind again a bupe molecule binds to your receptor for an average of 40 minutes after which it also releases to recirculate and either reattach or get metabolized so it‚Äôs not that bupe is ‚Äúripping‚Äù oxy off your receptors it‚Äôs that bupe is occupying your receptors so that oxy can not attach due to both the length of time that bupe stays attached and it‚Äôs higher binding affinity than oxy or any other full agonist opioidsin most any other context i would agree with you but dope dealers and opioid dealers in particular tend to be

answer you‚Äôre looking for oxy  the answer you‚Äôre not looking for this is the worst possible idea you could come up the opioid high is only a temporary escape you chase that feeling repeatedly and soon you are psychologically and physically dependent then you spend all your money on the drug and after that you probably resort to doing illegal things to get money you finally realize you have a problem and try to detox at home but you can‚Äôt because the withdrawals are horrible so you go to rehab once you sober up in rehab you realize the problems that you first tried to escape are still there only now they are 100x worse so you relapse to escape again and the cycle starts all over you waste years of your life cycling through rehabs and long periods of using drugs punctuated by shitty

chronic opioid use are 100 reversible with sufficient abstinence and that includes methadone  the danger with opioids lies in overdose potential and addiction potential and the risky behavior associated with it sharing needles risky sex etc opioids are incredibly safe class of drugs otherwise
,,,2_feet_back,opiates,i hadn‚Äôt really noticed but yea and as much as i don‚Äôt think it matters people die from opiates often they are both unhealthy choices and can lead to serious danger but meth is not as easy to od‚Äôd on but meth really lives in the shadows i use in the shadows it is kind of ridiculous i think if people were fully educated on what it is what it does they wouldn‚Äôt be so arrogant desoxyn is prescription meth stuff on the streets just very strong and often cut and cooked poorly meth is bad but people think we are out here drinking bleach and calling it drugs people don‚Äôt know much in the life of meth users what loved celebrity is going to win them over loool honestly the more i think of it fuck those people they aren‚Äôt just not on the addicts side they are against them and that‚Äôs just extra
,,,markvanslam,opiates^opiate^black,opiates are like magic you just swallow a pill and half an hour later youre in pure bliss and all is right with the worldthought my 17 year old selfi dont know i was taking pretty large doses of tramadol i was eating about 12 or 14 of the 50mg pills the withdrawal from tramadol is actually much worse than people think because it has the serotonergic element to it it can be just as bad as other opiate withdrawals i know because ive been through bothi was lucky enough to go to nine mile where he grew up and also to tuff gong studios and 56 hope road where he lived in kingston i got to meet his mother rita marley and damien suffice it to say it was a good trip   what are you wondering about regarding the family tree basically you have bobs parents who were a white man and a jamaican woman and then he and rita had ziggy and a few others  him and cindy breakspeare had damien she is half black and so is bob so damions 5050 as well he was with cindy breakspeare around the time that he was spending in london theres no way around it kind of was not being a great guy when he cheated on rita but we all have our flaws i guess i am happy to field any other questions as i have studied a lot about reggaesure do whatever best for you ive heard some people say that being on subs kills motivation but honestly i feel pretty fuckin motivated these days it might keep me a bit mellow and im good with that as long as you dont snort it shoot it or sell it you could actually be preventing yourself from further opiate addiction if they still have a lot of allure to you best of luck to you
,,,MystickBlade,opiates,yeah that‚Äôs what i mean leave out the molly it won‚Äôt mix well also the xans will potentiate the opiates so it will be a bit stronger then just the xans or just the hydros on their own so be careful with the dose what i‚Äôm saying is either do just the molly or do just the other three not the best idea to do all 4

,,,thatonecouch,opiate,i have stage 4 endometriosis degenerative joint disease chronic kidney stones and severe hemiplegic migraines i was addicted to opiates two in particular i have 18 months clean now and in that time i‚Äôve used prescribed medication twice both times for major invasive surgeries i get monthly epidural injections into my back to help with pain i‚Äôve gone through broken ribs kidney stones migraines root canals  all without using opioids are like an allergy for me  i cannot use them responsibly or without negative consequences the two times i did take them i was heavily monitored and my mom kept them out of my sight i was only given three days worth each time  opioids were never designed to be used for chronic pain they are targeted at acute pain to manage it until definitive treatment is reached use for chronic pain is detrimental to one‚Äôs health as the opiate hits the brain it releases dopamine or the feel good juice over time the brain develops a tolerance and it takes more drug to prompt that response it gets to the point that your body recognizes that the drugs are what make you feel good so your brain sends signals cravings in an effort to get you to give it what it needs to function normally if you don‚Äôt respond to that craving your body physically responds increasing in intensity until you put in think of it like hunger when you haven‚Äôt eaten your body sends signals in the form of a craving for food then it increases to stomach grumbling and cramping so on and so forth until you eat or die your brain is functioning in a sort of survival mode when telling you to eat and it‚Äôs in that same mode when telling you to put in more opiates of course you won‚Äôt die if you don‚Äôt put in but you‚Äôll be depressed due to lack of dopamine   it is possible to manage chronic pain without opiates it‚Äôs hard and uncomfortable at times but it‚Äôs worth it to be free from that which once enslaved me i wish you all luck in your journeyi‚Äôm proud of you for doing what you need to do methadone withdrawal can be tougher than normal opiate withdrawal so prepare yourself i think moving back to where you have a good support system is a great idea i moved back in with my parents and honestly i wouldn‚Äôt be where i am today without them i want you to know that you can do this i‚Äôm here for you whenever üñ§

,,,Dr3w_Cann0n,opioid^opiates,thanks im going to kick the kratom as soon as ive hit the month mark because from what ive read thats when withdrawals subside and im left with paws when i was sober for a spell i was using about an oz of kratom per day and phenibut sporadically at first but ended up bad off on it for about two years my so said i was just replacing addictions with the kratom jumped off and was left with a bad phenibut habit which i totally replaced with phase 2 of my opioid addiction which included the hard shit but i had a well paying job at that time until i went down the spiral losing that job legal trouble and my kids and their mom point being gabagerics scare me my first love were bars and alcohol  when i switched to phenibut the withdrawals were probably the worst ive had until i kicked this done  but i do get where youre coming from im trying to get on suboxone and just taper down once im through the thick of this while setting up a sober foundation and suchits a red state through and through also i dont feel like opiates are on the level theyre at on the east coast so help is scarce unless youre insured the usa in general hates the poorid say you either die a stoner get clean or progress to opiates that is the natural order

,,,tigereye13,opiates^opiate^opioid,when i got tired of smoking weed everyday i started doing opiates every day it was great for the first month and then it ruined my entire life so dont do that üòÜcongrats but a strong painkiller lol i thought tramadol was a weak opiate it never did anything to me i def get higher on low dose hydro and even kratom than tramadol but everyone is different good jobjust the usual replacing my dads and grandma loratbs with tylenol stealing tar from roommate who introduced me opiates he wasnt even mad lol pawning a guitar my mom got for xmas making up stories why i needed money couple times took 40 out the cash register at work never got caught tho thank god ive been over that addiction for a couple yearssubs were the first opiate i got hooked on so personally i dont count it as clean time for myself but everybody has a different definition clean time is when im not dependent on an opiateyeah that was my story and i said bupe was the first opiate i got dependent on but i had experience with oxy 30s and hydro 10s beforehand i was well on my way to addiction but found out about bupe from a roommate that was prescribed and overall enjoyed it more because i had a low tolerance the half life was way longer and it was cheaper but i agree with it being hard to abuse bupe and get high yet it happens all the time for instance my aunt was suggested to go on suboxone from her doctor when she was coming off 40mg hydrocodone and it ruined her life even more bupe is a lot stronger than hydro and after 8 months on bupe she decided to taper and quit and the bupe wds made her want to die she said eyy hell ya congrats on the week clean from roxis roxi 30 was one of the first opiates i tried and quickly moved to bupe  i just have one question about your reply you start out saying i agree for your case since you were hooked to bupe for most people though that‚Äôs not the case could you clarify that because i believe majority of people on bupe are hooked to it and have a dependence in which they will have to go through withdrawals of they decide to quit i was no different yet my dose was low to moderate before i got it prescribed from doctor i would just take 2 mg every other day but i agree with what you say bupe has been a miracle for a plethora of people personally i dont think it was beneficial for to be on long term do you have a plan on how long youd like to stay on emi didnt mean to suggest your clean time as not real if ur on mat i just meant for me personally my clean date will start when im off all opiates proud of u tho i remeber seeing your posts 180 days agohmm i drink probably 5 nights a week on average but usually only 2 to 3 ipas and ive never noticed that i take kratom 3 times every day aswell it may be that i just casually drink the beers after work over the course of like 3 hours so i never really get drunk i wouldnt think the kratom would cancel or weaken the beer when i was on hard opiates alchohal made the opiate euphoria strongerya im still on it been like 14 months   when i got off fentheroin i was doing about 30 gpd which is a lot but not so much for people coming off hard opiates i didnt feel the kratom for at least a week now i am on 10 gpd and overall life is great soon i will finish my taper but with tramadol it should def work bc it is a fairly weak opioid and the kratom will help with the serotonin properties trams producedamn when i do opiates i get very social do tasks ive been putting off or can just chill its like am upper and downer at the same time for memethadone for a single relapse after months clean that methadone may as well tingle those receptors in a control way and send him off to the races op i wouldnt suggest getting on methadone unless you feel you have zero control and will die or if you dont want to me sober and be a synthetic opioid for a while either toss that shit or try and dilute it some way or sell it you dont need that shitglad i havent gone through that in a couple years on kratom now and sometimes when im off ill purposely not dose for like 20 hours so i can experience wd and see how bad it actually is while its no where near traditional opiates it is pretty shitty my eyes water up the same amount mild restless and lower back pain have never gone more than a day without so i assume i wouldnt sleep much without it trying to keep tapering down and hopefully jump sooni had a drug for a pretty good job last week i havent done hard opiates in a couple years but just do kratom beer and weed i got the phone call last week and had 6 days to get the weed out of my system the operating manager called me this morning saying i passed and offered me the job and i start wednesday  my secret is to just go in there after diluting my pee but not too much because the test could come up invalid but drink a decent amount of watergatorade beforehand make sure you pee at least 4 or 5 times during the day before the test take a couple b complex vitamims to give my urine a yellow tint instead of it being clear and take some creatine like 4 hours before so my creatine levels seem normal out of the 5 or 6 drug tests in my life ive never failed and usually had smoked 510 days before test may just be my metabolism and the fact i only smoke 3 or 4 times a week thoughgood job on wanting to kick your addiction it will only get worse with time you are likely to get a variety of answers on your question i cant tell you an absolute but can give my experience a couple times i used lope to combat early wds it works not a godsend but it does help dont take massive doses that some say they do it is not neccesary dont take it more than a week first day id take like 1015 pills so 2030mg then work my way down to none over the course of the week you dont have to take it a week either if a couple days past and you feel ready to stop then do so the 2nd day id take like 8 pills then 6 4 2  will it prolong the wds from those doses and length probably not maybe slightly like the runs will come back obviously and you may feel restless but that would still be the case even if you didnt take lope lope gets a bad rep and sometimes rightfully so bc ppl take huge doses for months and get hooked on it i hear wds are not fun and super long bc of the half life i think it is a useful drug to get clean in the right doses you wont feel 100 better maybe like 50 better everyone is different even when i took it ill still felt somewhat sick but my opiate usage was a lil higher than yours i was still detoxing my body while on the lope so it was beneficiary for me hope this helps also to note for some it takes a little while to get in the body so the first dose on day 1 i was always frustrated so id take another small dose like 6 more pills to load up and by day 2 i would feel a lot better and could tell its working it is pretty benign as long as you dont exceed the 2030mg range good lucknice cuban girls sexy are hell couple months ago this girl nearly bruised me with her boney hips lol not enough cushion for the pushin ive lost too many girls to opiates and am still single with no kids at 29 opiates are the only drug to make me choose it rather than a life with a beautiful girlyea i have to take 40mg  for good euphoria with a pretty low tolerance oxy hits me better and other stronger opiates obviouslyoxy doesnt come up opiates  i could have swore my parents tested me and i failed for roxis back in the dayoh i understand wish i would have tried that couple years ago lol but just remember what you are fighting for things could get a lot worse quick continue your taper and stay positive i know a couple nurses who use kratom that may be an option for you as you finish your taper and would help with cravings especially in early sobreighty  while it does have its own addiction potential and wds they are a cake walk compared to methadone and other harder opiates it really helped mewow sorry man use this as a cross roads in your life with opiates things will get a lot lot worse trust me shit basically ruined my life even though i just take a little kratom now long term opiate usage made my mental health a lot worse and im still repairing relationships and my life financially best of lucki know everybody has different backgrounds and experience yet its rare for someone to be content and happy with there life as am opiate addict not neccesary talking bout pain patients on a low to moderate dose of pills every month yet i see a lot of posts from them as well i never stole or became homeless cor anything like that never shot up but it ruined my potential and affected my life negativelyit aint easy being addicted to hard opiates without it affecting your life but i guess its possible for someyeah ive been on kratom for awhile now and obviously its lost that euphoria but back when i used traditional opiates it would give me the feeling i described yet thats where addiction and dependence come in and it aint worth itthanks for the reply i realize 180mg on methadone is rare but i saw it numerous times at meetings when i got out of rehab but i insure you i know what its like getting off heroinfent and get onto mat drugs i know you dont get high i did it dozens of times but my point was i didnt truly get happy off those drugs and didnt classify it as clean being on mat long term has its negatives as well as positives it helped millions of people im sure but just because it helps you doesnt mean you are clean everybody is different it negatively effected my life in the long term but i appreciate you replying im sorry if i came off as stuck up and conceited people told me im worthless and should burn in hell because i think being clean is being off all synthetic and natural opiates

,,,Th3Arcit3c,opiate^opiates^black,i have a similar background    the answer is taper kratom is legal and cheap are you going to say you dont have the will power or self controll to taper if so ask yourself does it take more willpower to taper or to ct    i tried ct and realized it takes more willpower for me to get past day 2 and 3 just like the heroin wds i went thru for ten years i couldnt taper heroin the high was too euphoric and irresistible but kratom isnt   you can do it but if you really feel you cant taper give your stash to someone who will distribute it to you and be accountable for you   drop one gram over your dosing per week stick to it there wont be as painful   smoke 24 cigs a day if you smoke 23 a day for thre next 4 days your body and mind wont feel it  apply this concept to your kratom all the way down   you can do this if you really want to do this painlessly remember how bad opiate wd week is  why pay that concenquence for kratom we didnt get the good highs like h but at the end the concenquence is the same but doesnt have to be taper     üòéüëç you can do thisand what sucks is the lack of transparency in this documentary is working against the movement   webmd says kratom is as dangerous as fentanyl that is ridiculous of course it makes them look blindly stupid or in denial  this documentary says its not addictive ok so if for some its not so is that what everyone is to expect  of course not thats not what is common   people if you really believe its not addictive head over to quittingkratom forum the 10s of thousands of people all there must be just lying or so dumb its the symptoms they had before it  4 to 6 days of insomnia diarrhea  restless leg syndrome obsessive cravings for anything to make it stop temperary depression anxiety attacksx etc now does that happen to everyone no of course not but dont you think it should be included doesnt it make them look deceptive    hiding what can be found google search from any forum after forum of physical dependence that is definitely not  anything like caffine withdrawal ffs   be in denial folks maybe you dont have these issues but thousands and thousands do yet its not mentioned   hmmmm  i take it 3x daily and all for it staying legal  but i dont need to leave out pretty important facts about it to convince someone its good thats the wrong way going about it   imagine youre gonna vote about this issue you know nothing about it you see the documentary so youre intrigued then you google or reddit or see the detox centers of people going thru hell not for for all but some  and then wouldnt you wonder to yourself why they left that out id see it as deceptive and assume it must be bad and vote it down   since when is something on fucking television more creditable than thousands and thousands of peoples experiences    stop being a blind sheep like webmd is as well be 100 transparent if ya want it to remain legal    i mean alcohol causes physical depndance and is addicting and people get outta control on it that doesnt mean we lie about it to keep it legal and it has no medical value or saves you from anything   so many pros outweigh the cons anyhow  like you cant  od no cns depression its cheap easy to make so much more going for it than prescription opiates we dont need to hide the truth or lie to get it pushed thru   its a magical thing in itself  ps edited for typos sorry üòé  thank you for humbly coming to my tedxtalk folks  careful on your journey home  üëçit is a state of mind to an extent buta there are physical changes the physical changes are what make it a disease by definition unfortunately   when opiates gaba drugs xanax ex are used in excess or longterm it  actually changes the brain the frontal cortex is responsible for reasoning common sense and process thinking  once physically dependent and addicted the frontal cortex activity depletes to almost no activity and your fight or flight gland hypothalamus gland takes over   when youre without the drug the hypothalamus triggers adrenaline and the fight or flight response a panic compulsing you to get more   literally you struggle and do things that would harm yourself to get your drug of choice reasoning and common sense is out the door  at that point it literally isnt willpower anymore youre unable to think properly because of the physical change  this reason is the only reason the medical field has accepted it as a disease and its why insurance companies will pay 40000 dollars for a month of treatment if it werent classed as a disease it would have to come out of your pocket  so this is a scientific fact that is a goodz thing its why people now have empathy for addicts    they can get ya off the drugs but only god can fix the physical brain change that has happened your disease the efficiency potency to the receptors higher affinity the quicker and the higher the tolerance will build meaning a mean ass withdrawal   like phenibut has a  crazy affinity for most 3 or 4 days in a row withdrawal syndrome happens most narcotics take weeks to months or even years for some  for this to happen   xanax causes a pretty quick tolerance and dependence not just because of the affinity at the receptor site but also because of the short half life   drugs with short half lifes cause a quick rapid withdrawal like say 4 to 6 days but its a profound withdrawal   where as drugs like suboxone have a huge half life48 to 72 hrs  which still  causes a withdrawal but usually for most not as violent of an withdrawal but it will last longer like 2 to 3 weeks of it   heroin withdrawal is crazy violent when i went thru it for like 4 to 5 days  when i withdrawald from suboxone it wasnt as bad for me but lasted for almost a month heroin  high affinity at opiate receptors with a 6 to 8 hour half life where suboxone is less efficient compared to heroin but the half life is 48 to 72 hours vs 8 hour half life like heroin   hope that all makes sense   sorry im withdrawing as we speak from kratom lol on the 3 day no sleep yet since last dose ugh why do i do this to myself   krstom got me off heroin but now i wd from it  its no different feeling accept i feel i got ripped off because i didnt get the blissful highs like heroin gave but im still paying for it now   edited for typosfuk üòéit is possible i know this isnt relative to you but when i went thru oxy withdrawal perc 30s i used meth for 4 days if it past the peak then after just had insomnia of course and an hour or two of restlessness for 3 or 4 days at night once the lights were out and trying to sleep  which im sure some of that was the meth comedown   but even tho meth doesnt hit the opiate receptor and obviously not cocaine but the high from the meth i believe was just more intense than the withdrawls from the oxy   i was at the end of the oxy taper i had done over 3 weeks üòéüëç  2 years clean in march üí™first time i ever injected coke i started shaking uncontrollably freaked me the fuck out like a seizure but completely alert and awake for it  ironically it didnt scare me away  instead i started cooking down crack in a spoon added a little  vinegar and or vitamin c to break it down and make it  injectable since its not water soluable like powder  is then  id  injected it 5 dollar feels like 20 dollars of  blow with no grinding of the teeth but the come up on it was insane totally flooded with sweat instantly feeling like yore in a pizza oven   that i odd on for sure i kept injecting crack then started mixing my heroin in with it for one injection together i know right fucking idiot right  i remember hearing the ringing in my ears then everything went black next thing i woke up to someone doing cpr on my chest trying to pump my heart never ever ever did that again   never touched cocaine again and thats when i started my 2 yr battle to get off hof course people new to it have a hard on for the documentary since its the only one of it kind with at least some info on it but big factors have been left out   if i were one of the people that go thru bad withdrawals  and based my use on that documentary alone id be fucking pissed and my hardon would be at wanting to get it  banned   we dont need people backsliding that are for it in the 1st place then later feel deceived in my state alone just under 3000 overdose deaths due to opiates that are not kratom  kratom has less than 100 known accusations of related deaths mostly with other drugs involved so there is  their example of blind faith  on the  opposing  side as well   this documentary should be called leaf of blind faith it needs redone maybe when they made it they were clueless as to this but i dont think so   re do the documentary put in all facts the truth shall set you free    lets keep it legalized folks the post was so long i guess adding the past opiate history wouldnt of made it much worse üôÑi have to be honest  i am 2 yrs clean off an opiate addiction of 10yrs with opiates i have major issues   had gabapentin rx and klonopin rx for years never had issues with them off and on thru the dr they were lower dose a few times i took a few extra klonopin but it just made me sleep too much felt best st 5mg   but opiates are another story a nightmare for me   im in my 40s now  i guess being scared of another nightmare again i stay humblethen after a week the ten dollars worth does nothing then ya need 20 and so on then 100 dollars does nothing so then ya agree to inject it even tho ya promise yourself youd never do that after the 1st injection 10 bucks feels like 200 dollars worth snorted so it feels like injecting is the answer to being able to afford it   then you guessed it a week later 10 dollars ivd wontdo itthen ya inject 20 and a week later etc  then before ya know it ya dont even get high or any pleasure from it and chasing it daily is just to stave off withdrawals just to feel normal and able to function   then after some time doing it if ya get a kidney stone or something requiring pain meds in the hospital  they wont touch the pain your tolerance gets so high the amount of pain meds ya need to get rid of the pain they wont give that much afraid you will od   even after almost a year of no opiates its like i have permanent tolerance what would make someone almost od  doesnt even touch my pain    after all this i look back with nothing but regret   i know you were oy asking about doing it once but realize this every heroin addict only intended on trying it and never thought they would get to the point theyd inject  its madness  the insanity of it is insaneactually now you say it when i use phenibut i smoke cigarettes like a mad man i bet it is related to gaba agonists maybe  same when i drink  but ya right on my buddy told me he took gabapentin for a week once and he claimed it was like xanax wd but not quite as severe i was scared to stop taking my phenibut   im with you sort of on enjoyment of gaba substances i do not enjoy the high at all i took 15grams once of phenibut and did not enjoy it whatsoever gave me a bad headache and remember the veins in my temples looked as thick as the ones in my forearm   i think its why i havent chased the dosage up higher and higher one day i take 500mgs the next i might take 12grams never been over 12 and never been under 500mgs i find that is the right dose i get the calming effects from without making me feel like i want to sleep and no need for caffine at this dose i look back and have no days where i think to myself that its not working or need to take more   i think its from not taking set doses each day ive never taken the same dose two days in a row it always fluctuates daily   kratom and opiates on the other hand i have to taper taper taper and still wd some when i stop i dont get it

,,,OGSkywalker97,opiates^opioid,maybe in the uscanada but in europe no one would be prescribed opiates for having teeth removed youd  be told to take ibuprofen and paracetamol the max youd get is some 8mg codeineparacetamol pillsi know it activates them but once it binds to the receptors it blocks other classic opiates from binding sort of like buprenorphineeven before the opioid crisis you wouldnt get more than ibuprofen in the uk especially for a 13 yr old üòÆ maybe some cocodamol if its badi just take 2 capsules a day really helps with stress and anxiety for me it has even been shown to reverse damage to neurones caused by stress it also reduces cortisol levels  but basically i noticed my tolerance wasnt increasing very fast compared to what id heard and i looked into it i found a study showing that the spine density of dopamine receptors remained the same when using ashwagandha with opiates simply put  normally when you continuously take opiates the amount of dopamine receptors decreases and they become down regulated meaning they are less sensitive to dopamine so require more of it for the same response this is a big part of what leads to tolerance so ashwagandha really aids in slowing this down and maintaining tolerance   i made a post about it if you wanna take a look you can also google ashwagandha and opiates and the study should show up although its quite technical  edit id highly recommend using ksm66 ashwagandha as it has the highest concentration of withanolides which are what contribute to reduced stress and maintaining toleranceashwagandha has been proven to help prevent tolerance build up from opiates it prevents down regulation of dopamine receptors in the spine

,,,Thedopedaze,opiates^opioid^opiate,oh shit yeah the ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù are a real thing actually usually associated with getting off of ssris i was on zoloft for like a month so that i could eventually get on klonopin and when i got off i had the brain zaps it‚Äôs a weird sensation for sure and with opiates i feel more like my brain is constricting during wds and my skin is crawlingseizures form stopping opiates shit that scares me now does that happen or is it because of all of the crazy fent analogues now assuming the pills op is getting now might be pressedanother thing to add is to try exercising i know everything in your body and mind is telling you it‚Äôs impossible but just try to force yourself to run or bike perhaps even lift some weights if you‚Äôre near a gym so your restless muscles have something to do   i just cut from 4 to 2mg once daily and while wds have only been mild i‚Äôve been forcing myself to run 35 minutes after work and alternate arm and leg days as well because i get rls and restless arms i‚Äôm also taking magnesium glycinate hope that helps  edit will also produce natural endorphins‚Äúnatural opiates‚Äù in the brain you will feel better after i promise you won‚Äôt regret iti had success with linzess but it‚Äôs not specifically for opioid induced constipation it‚Äôs a prescription and i don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a generic yet of course my insurance no longer covers it tho so i‚Äôve just been taking magnesiumsomeone said burn in hell jeez people take this sub too seriously sometimes i take your post as what it is an opinion yours for a sub that promotes honest discourse about this type of stuff the worst thing that could ever happen is for this place to become a complete echo chamber   i am on subs and consider myself ‚Äúclean‚Äù i guess because i‚Äôm not seeing a dealer everyday spending all of my money lying to people and basically ruining my life howeveri‚Äôm not myself again yet not 100 anyways it has served its purpose for me at this point and your line about not progressing in your career and continuing to isolate while on it resonated with me i hate being on subs now every day is like a 510 i‚Äôm still tired a lot but they likely saved my life earlier on in my recovery i‚Äôve been tapering but the upcoming wds i‚Äôll inevitably have to deal with are scaring the shit outta me   my point isi wish i had just gotten this over with early on and dealt with just the h withdrawals but back then i wouldn‚Äôt have been in the mental place to stop yet so it‚Äôs a doubleedged sword subs helped me get the ‚Äúclean‚Äù life so that my thinking could finally change enough to be able to handle these upcoming wds without turning to dope i‚Äôm ready now but it took years it‚Äôs going to be difficult but i know the payoff of never needing any type of opiate when i wake up to feel normal will be so worth itlots of good advice in these comments it‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs always a matter of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù not ‚Äúif‚Äù and once you realize or experience how scary things can getit‚Äôs much easier to finally stop sure being on opiates is an amazing feeling and so was the rush but thinking ‚Äúi can keep this up forever‚Äù has zero logic behind it i seriously thought at one point that the party never had to be over   otherwise if you know you‚Äôll have to stop someday anyways why not stop nowi definitely clench my teeth day and night when i start to withdraw definitely gives me those temple headaches unrelated to hypertension but still a headache related to opiate use nonethelessthis is so weirdi was diagnosed with hypothyroid with nodules too right after i quit and got on suboxone i started gaining weight rapidly more so than the normal ‚Äúgetting clean‚Äù weight and was diagnosed like 6 months later   there‚Äôs no history of it in my family or anything else i know it‚Äôs common but i seriously think it‚Äôs linked to opiate use somehow or maybe even suboxone i was only a user for a couple of years i wish there were more studies on thisidk   i know opiates can be tough on the endocrine system but i doubt tons of legitimate pain patients who take prescriptions regularly have these sorts of thyroid issues otherwise we‚Äôd be hearing about it on top of all of the other opiate lawsuits and whatnot going on right now interested to hear if you know of any studies or even something anecdotal related to thisagreed i hate when people say that on the news articles andor even moviesshows when they try to cover  portray the opioid epidemic like no that barely scratches the surface and is not why people get stuck in this cycle for years it‚Äôs the mental torture   trainspotting is the only thing that comes to mind as far as getting it right and capturing that aspect accurately in that movie even after the wds are done renton is bored  unmotivated not feeling like himself  right before he ods while on methadoneagreed that mental torture is the absolute worst part which is why i hate when people who have never used opiates or gone through withdrawal act like it‚Äôs the exact same thing as the flu sure the physical symptoms are similar runny nose and sneezing gi issues etc but i‚Äôve never had a flu that‚Äôs completely mentally debilitated me people don‚Äôt keep using because they‚Äôre afraid of getting the flu for 47 days wethey keep using because they‚Äôre afraid of the mental hell that comes next and fucking lingers well after the physical wds are gone   so yes for me it‚Äôs the mental part plus the restless legs and sometimes arms that kept me up all night and resulted in no sleep for days on end also the weird brain fuzzyness that also feels like my head is like constrictingthe pressure on it sometimes idk hard to explain but i‚Äôm sure you know what i‚Äôm talking about lack of motivation is awful i‚Äôll throw that in with the mental torture then second comes all of the weird smells and genital tingling  hahamy hair thinned about a year after going on suboxone which coincided with being diagnosed with hypothyroid once i got on levothyroxine for a while and switched to head  shoulders it got better i also take biotin now but it got better before that   for me it was less of a side effect and more related to hypothyroid i‚Äôve seen other women saying they were diagnosed after going on subs too it could be subs or opioid addiction or something else idk but opiates are definitely hard on the endocrine systemit‚Äôs so weird because i‚Äôve seen other people saying stuff like this about opiates in general but have never found anything about it agreed w subs too yeah i never got ‚Äúsick sick‚Äù on heroin either it‚Äôs weird some people chock it up to the lack of socialization during addiction and isolating yourself more therefore you don‚Äôt get sick but on suboxone we‚Äôre back out in the world working seeing friends and family again etc i only very recently got a mild sore throat thing but it was manageable and i didn‚Äôt miss any work everyone else seemed to be getting sick and i finally caught it once i dropped my sub dose to 4mg lol

,,,d3fault_position,black^china,ive been a practicing black metal musician since about 99 and i began incorporating elements of hypnotic repetition into my earlier music recordings of which no longer exist unfortunately needless to say this made each song an incantation of sorts and an exercise in subliminal transmission i started to notice that my music could provoke fearful reactions and emotions in other people and even myself   ive noticed that black metal of the more depressive ambient and atmospheric varieties has the potential to recreate what i sought to do with my own music early on its often repetitive slower in tempo easy to immerse oneself in and enhance certain emotional states   i would imagine that it would be good for meditative purposes provided of course that one enjoys such music in the first place actually tbh it would be an interesting experiment for someone to try who doesnt typically enjoy such musichad to go check it out just to satisfy my curiosity and to verify info in op and found this article   httpwwwxinhuanetcomenglish20180104c136872077htm  not only is it the first level 4 biolab in china but it only went into operation in 2018 2 years later theres an outbreak in the same province thats mighty suspiciousnever scared me but i do really enjoy this film for one thing its visually stunning im a song writer in some darker genres and id often put this movie on with the volume off as some black metal played in the background   underrated movie imo

,,,ShamansHawk1111,black^dreams^opiate^chocolate,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvogxnxtzovvet20s  this is from 2011 im the guy with the black v next to singer sloppy and fun are both understatements definitely not my best work musically but it was still a great experience that was our first original song we all pretty much created it together i think that band is now reduced to a solo project of just the singer and his guitar tracks i dont follow it honestly im more focused on recording my own music now and practicing technique and playing with more emotionyoure welcome i love sharing things that have helped me with others seeking help  psychedelics have changed my life for the better too   the good quality whole nutmeg i use has a similar level of psychedelic activity as middle shelf cannabis which personally is perfect for me nutmegs psychedelic properties give me a good mood lift feelings of mild euphoria and lasting wellbeing a more positive worldview and kindling for creative inspiration sometimes i get teary from my heart opening on nutmeg like a psychedelic spiritual cleansing i experience all these different effects on different levels with different amounts of nutmeg 12g is perfect for work 715g is great for events like going to a themepark a movie a night out a long trip or even just a lazy stoney day at home playing video games i love how it lasts all fucking day and takes care of me until my head hits the pillow i think these tiny doses work well on me because i grate my nutmeg nuts  to answer your question on the 25 gram dose did you grate or grind your original 15g dose you do not need to ingest more nutmeg for a stoning effect 15 grams should be way stronger for you than before if you grate the nuts what brand of nutmeg do you use its possible your nutmeg may just be low quality ingesting more will not help that   you need to get a grater or at least smash them and put them in a coffee grinder turn the nuts into powder in some way because there is more surface area exposing nutmegs special active oils making it totally more effective wash back with cold water and enjoy   on 6 grams of nutmeg and a little black coffee 4 hours after dosing i see shimmering on striped surfaces like vents and window blinds and i can even see faint patterns dancing between the grooves and lots of motion tracers and mild colorful static in a mild stoned haze during this ill feel happy and calm maybe even feel giddy or excited if im doing something normal like grocery shopping or cooking at home the whole experience is enjoyable especially with headphones   to answer your question about serotonin depletion i think too much nutmeg too often is not healthy for your brain or your body doses like 14 grams daily is not bad at all but 10 grams every day for over a week is too much i get mentally and physically slow from doing too much of it like that i get perfect results using nutmeg every other day or 4 days on  1 day off  repeat 5 days on  1 day off is pushing it too much nutmeg too often will not help depression it will make you feel tired if you find your sweet spot with nutmeg dosage intervals and caffeine you are set for life  im currently 14 hours into 3 grams of grated nutmeg as of now only 3 grams i feel a nice tingle in my head body and legs i also have the munchies i felt a little irritated at work today but i was definitely not miserable i was able to be friendly with customers and coworkers and work hard through my shift without hating life  and thats all i could ask for for work i combine nutmeg with tiny doses of kratom and ltheanine as well  i hope my freakishly long reply helps you ask me anything else if you need clarity on thisstay away from preground nutmeg its not medicine like whole nutmeg  for whole nutmeg nuts dont just eat them   either grate the nuts with a finesmall holes cheese grater and washparachute back with water or smash the nuts then grind the smashed nuts in an electric coffee grinder and then parachute the powderharder to swallow than grated nuts you could mix your grated or grinded nutmeg nuts in oatmeal or applesauce but that honestly makes me gag especially with any amount above 2 grams of nutmeg  for me its easiest to just grate the nuts by hand weigh the dose and wash back with cold water little by little no gagging no problems ill sit down and grate up to 80 grams of nutmeg in one sitting for a months worth of dosing so i dont have to do it every day   oh shit i just remembered my nutmeg recipes sometimes ill get cookie dough from the store and infuse the cookie dough with nutmeg by putting one section of doughone cookies worth of dough at a time in a pot on low heat with a tiny smidge of butter and 47 grams of grated nutmeg ill mix the dough and nutmeg together with a wooden spoon by rolling and kneading it together in the pot the butter helps the nutmeg powder stick to the cookie dough once the dough collects the 47 grams of nutmeg powder i place the dough on the baking sheet to be baked bake to desired texture whether you prefer mooshy cookies crispy cookies or right in between with chocolate chip the flavor is wonderful when dipped in black coffee that is the ultimate morning ritual nutmeg cookie dipped in black coffee i called them space cookies  an easier recipe is to mix your desired amount of gratedgrinded nutmeg powder with peanut butter put some regular butter in a pan or pot and mix your nutmeg powder with your preferred amount of peanut butter add sugar to taste  this one is addictive you can put it in a sandwich with jelly or just eat it with a spoon haha i loved this one   sorry i got carried away   liver problems ive been taking nutmeg regularly for almost 3 years and ive had no known liver complications i used to take 19 grams of nutmeg 45 days a week then i noticed that 812 grams of nutmeg felt easier on my body then lowered down to 58 grams regularly by now i take 23 grams of nutmeg 4 days a week simply because the lower doses are very effective on me now if i ever get liver complications i will post on it until then this stuff is honestly as harmless as weed if used responsibly  if you drink lots of alcohol or smoke lots of cigarettes or eat lots of junk food nutmeg may be a bad combo for you i dont do any of these things and get wonderful effects from whole nutmeg   sorry for the long post i love this medicinei had a dream of a familiar person doing something to my spine i was telling them stop hurting my back that hurts stop it and then waking up still feeling that terrible spinal pain for about 10 to 20 seconds still saying stop hurting my back that was a weird one  x200b  had something exactly the same happen to my manly parts too that one hurt really bad and i still felt it when i woke up   x200b  yes i feel excruciating pain in my dreams toothank you so much for your awesome honest response   it must be a true blessing to know workers of these medicines that can brew it for you and guide you through the complex worlds the medicine can take you to  i think my question of combining these two plants of power comes from my personal longing and coveting of ayahuasca i bet she will kick my ass for this when i finally meet her ive tried brewing it at least 5 times and failed each time i did this with gentle singing prayers and wholesome intentions the best i could a reliable ayahuasca recipe is a subject for another thread and theres already tons of threads on it good ones too   to be fair once on an attempted aya brew i briefly floated through a space star tunnel with closed eyes and later saw a perfect circle in black darkness and the circle led to a place with blue skies and tan desert mountains and the circle was framed by a series of small benevolent eyes i wanted to go there but it was too distant this was with chacruna diplopterys cabrerana and caapi i combined chacruna chaliponga and caapi once and it did nothing but clear my digestive system i was hoping the mimosa hostilis would work better since ive read tons of experiences using this ingredient with wonderful results  if theres anything else you would like to share on the subject please feel free toits no problem ask away   yes i say kratom is in fact a stimulant because 1 i cannot sleep after consuming kratom red sumatra is said to be the most relaxing and pain killing strain and i could not sleep until it wore off i was laying awake going through all these social scenarios goals memories just thought after thought at that time i think i drank a 1 gram tea of that red sumatra someone close to me who tried kratom for pain relief at night had trouble sleeping too  2 the outdoor laborers in the southeast asian islands and countries thailand malaysia indonesia etc this is where kratom and nutmeg come from love kratom and drink it throughout the day it relieves them of their tiredness and gives them energy to do intense physical labor all day they pronounce it kruhtom and they chew the leaves 13 leaves per dose for them  im sure some people can sleep on kratom but i cannot im more of a stoner never an opiate user other than kratom so that might have something to do with its effect on me  kava is more of a downer i usually drink kava on days off and nutmeg breakshere is one thread on the essential oil posted by 69ron  you can easily find more threads on nutmeg essential oil by simply googling nutmeg essential oil forum and youll run into plenty of reading material and experiences  httpswwwtapatalkcomgroupsherbsmxfnutmegoilafarbetterpsychedelicthannutmegnut3619726html  but the way 69ron doses his oil in capsules is just weird to me  heres an easier way to dose the oil i get a cookie any cookie like chips ahoy or something i measure 1ml dont over do it by using my measuring spoons using the 14 teaspoon one quarter teaspoon i fill that spoon flat with nutmeg essential oil using a dropper that comes with the oil and dump it onto the cookie the cookie is necessary because the oil soaks into the cookie surface and will not be lost goes down easier on chocolate chip cookies too   1ml is enough 2ml was pretty strong and made me giggly while at work which is a bit too much was reminding me of my mild acid trips i dont need to be mildly tripping and giggling at nothing while serving the public lol    the effect of the essential oil on 1ml is less stoney and more focused and stimulating than regular nutmeg the stimulating effect literally gets stronger and stronger over a course of 12 hours like regular nutmeg i always have my caffeine with this too and i seem to be more jittery under the effect of nutmeg essential oil i generally feel happier on it too and work harder i stress that its pretty stimulating so if you plan to get to sleep at 9pm at night you need to dose this essential oil around 7am that morning it may still be pretty stimulating past 9pm that night it can keep you awake past midnight easy when i need to sleep id pop a melatonin and just lay as still as i can to get to sleep    im sorry that all this is so complicated and long lol its one thing after another please be careful and do lots of reading if you even think about trying any of this stuff im willing to go into more detail on any of this if you want

,,,PCJ69,opiates^opiate^opioid^opium,i love benzos and opiates in my experience benzos can fuck your life up just as badly if not worse they lower your inhibitions to the point where you would do things without giving a fuck about the consequences at all especially when blacked outi dont know why but opiates dont seem to have any effect on my bowels maybe because of my ibsi love opiates theyre my favourite class of drugs but for some reason they make me extremely irritable like when someone drops a cup or burps for example it pisses me off so much   opioids do numb my emotions but i just cant figure out why they make me so much more irritable than usual  im asking you because ive made so many posts about this but no one has answered my question as yet and youre the only one on the post so far that seems to have extensive knowledge and some experience with opiatesi just prefer the word opiate to opioid because im a lazy fuck and i dont want to enunciate the oibut wouldnt opiatesopioids have to act on opioid receptors to be considered so regardless or their chemical similarities im not sure if dxm acts on these receptorsi occasionally dream of doing heroin but the only opiate ive ever gotten high off of was codeinelol i dont do codeine because its cool i do it to self medicate when im in pain or depressed otherwise i take it recreationally   ive been getting high off of it since i was 12 and even then i never took it because of some dumb trend or to look cool i never even knew people commonly abused it then   people who do drugs because they think that its cool are making a huge and easily preventable mistake especially when it comes to opiates in regard to its addiction potential   im being hypocritical because abusing drugs recreationally is also stupid yet people who smoke or drink alcohol dont get criticised almost nearly as much as elicit drug usersyou have 30mg pills ive been getting high off of codeine since i was 12 and it only takes 20mg after a week long tolerance break on an empty stomach for me to get a light nod  id say take 4 or 5 if its your first time doing codeine since you might not realize youre high as you arent familiar with the feeling and its a fairly weak opiateyeah i know benzos and opiates are a dangerous combo but i wouldve definitely odd with that much codeine on its own i wouldnt have taken that dose if i didnt black out on the benzos90 pounds thats fucking ridiculous im south african and theres a brand that costs around 1 pound per bottle we dont even need a prescription for codeine its otc  its probably because lean is nowhere nearly as praised here as it is in the us or the uk we do have a problem with opiates and lean is fairly popular amongst teenagers but its not an epidemic   i really fucking hope codeine doesnt become prescriptiononly here withdrawals will fucking kill me along with my chronic paini took zopiclone because i was extremely depressed i blacked out and i was meant to take 300mg because my back was fucking killing me and i had a cluster headache  i knew that a regular dose wouldnt relieve the pain because i have a high codeine tolerance i lost my inhibitions on the zopiclone and i took double the dose instead  i went to my room and i immediately knew that i took too much i layed on my bed and tried to stay awake while forcing my self to breathe at the same time  i felt better after a few minutes after i threw up i never would have done this if i were sober i know how deadly cns depressants and opiates are  i feel much better now i just feel like puking every now and then the codeine atleast managed to get rid of the headache and backache feel like it never happened   after this experience i definitely wont do this shit againtramadol can get you high not all people can get high from it as different people process it differently   tramadol is a fairly weak opioid and is about the same strength as codeine prolonged use could cause serotonin syndrome this can also happen if you combine it with ssris  i personally prefer codeine i cant get high off tramadol at all   you should not exceed 400mg per day as there is a seizure risk above that dose i dont know how it will feel compared to oxy as ive never taken oxy before nor have i gotten high off of trams its only ever potentiated codeine for mei asked a similar quesrion a few days ago most people commented that they both feel pretty much the same both codeine and heroin are metabolised into morphine   i think that one thing that definitely cant be compared between the two is the rush heroin is converted into 6mam giving the user an intense rush that cant be compared to many other opiates   other than that i think that the feeling such as the emotional numbing warmth and the type of euphoria that you get would feel the same at some point during both highsoh fuck you guys need a script for codeine thats the dumbest shit ive ever heard i wouldnt be surprised if people move to dope to treat chronic pain just because they cant get otc codeine   how about poppies what if you grow them and extract the opium or make poppy seed tea i think its legal to grow a certain amount of opium poppies but its illegal to extract the opium i dont see how you would get caught if you grow it in your own garden where no one else can see its extremely addictive thoughidk how the fuck anyone would be able to workout on opiates when im on them i couldnt give a fuck about anything besides laying down and enjoying my high

once did i take more than the prescribed dose in fact i halved it due to side effects like cold chills   opium contains morphine yes and codeine and thebaine which has miniscule effect but it is much safer than taking pure morphine and way more safe than heroin id think i mean it stands to reason that as something is made more potent it may also be more dangerous more side effects stronger high stronger withdrawals and therefore easier addiction and overdose its almost like weed vs all the synthetic cannabinoidsi am aware that noids are full agonists and thc is only partial whereas morphine is the same both in opium and isolated  i dont see why modern medicine didnt just stick with opium and morphine instead of developing stronger and more addictive drugs that are worse than opium i mean opium addicts are typically very functional compared to addicts of its derivatives even those who smoke 12 grams a day according to this       httpsjournalssagepubcomdoiabs101177002204267900900209journalcodejodayes i heard of red rock incense this is a reputable seller who advertises to europe but i asked and they are willing to ship to us they have shireh and regularyeah i didnt think fent at all but besides itchiness drowsiness and euphoria idk the effects of opiates he was possibly nodding off but he is very drug naive and he didnt really get when i tried to ask him if he had been he definitely zoned out and left reality for long periods possibly nodding off and said at times he felt like he was losing himself   i live in colorado and smoke legal weed every day unfortunately i wasnt with him and he is in an illegal stateif the black is just substrate and not something growing then i as a noob currently still waiting for my first jars to finish colonizing think it looks fineobviously just say no doesnt work but discouraging someone from future exploration in opiates who has just read about the people here suffering addiction might actually influence them as does the oppositeif ya wanna get high smoke some weed dont move on to harder shit and weed will suit you just fine if you go and get yourself an addiction to opiates then yeah weed may feel like a shitty high that would be my advice opiates and benzos are better off used medicinally and never recreationallyand i was saying how about stay away from opiates in the first place and never have to resort to immodium because it is worse for you physically than percs yet its not what will hook you i have immediate family who moved on to heroin after stealing some of my percs when i broke my leg in high school god bless baltimorewhat the fuck goes through peoples heads who say shit like this like yeah anyone who does this recreationally is a dumbass but how the fuck are you gonna follow that up with take a few percs  when taking a few percs is what eventually leads people to using a shitty horrible substance like loperamide for withdrawal moreover he admitted to being a dumbass probably a fucking teenager who just wanted to try some lean   what the fuck you tried an otc drug to get high because you dont have any connects we use that for withdrawal here go get addicted to real opiates and then you can come here and post about using loperamide dangerously and stupidly the right way   i hope you were kidding when you said take a few percs if so downvote and ignore meyeah that sounds like laudanum which is a really old medicine made of opium dissolved in alcohol or it could be paregoric which is camphorated rather than alcohol  where tf and when did you find laudanum  especially in an original bottle like that you must be older than melike an opium vape cart i see those or like laudanum easy to make or do you mean a smokeable form of opium that is thick and syripy but a liquidthanks im definitely thinking ill end up using a dab rig for it might try hot kniving once just to feel old school im actually reading that codeine cant be smoked and opium has codeine so taking a slightly bigger dose orally works better and much longer than smoking ill test both ill have it probably late february or early march hopefully i plan to make a post about itvery nice to know i think you can still buy pods online but they are hard to find and ive also heard of poppy seed tea but many places are now selling only washed seeds   i see you are correct about the different cultivars of poppies actually being all papaver somniferum none of the other species of poppy except possibly papaver orientale could have been what they were after looking it up i do know that many opium dealers over centuries have bred poppies that produce higher amounts of active alkaloids in the opium but all papaver somniferum have a good enough amountthis is definitely a plan for the future however my space is way too limited currently i got the idea after doing some lawn work for a woman with poppies i think they were bread seed poppies not papaver somniferum yet they still bled latex that tasted like opium is described when smokex and may have had a very very slight effect she wanted me to cut them down but it was like the last thing she wanted me to finish  so i scraped them then the next day collected the latex and took the heads home after cutting them down when i finished   this experience made me really wanna try real opium largely for the taste alone it was delicious in a floral choclatey incensey kinda wayyeah see this is what i expected and thank you for confirming it this falls in line with experience reports on erowid except for ones that just say a bowl is the amount smoked and dont even mention how many bowls they get out of a gram    it seems entirely unreasonable that id need 2 grams for smoking ive heard of hotkniving and i could also try a dab rig i guess i will probably try both smoking and eating small amounts they also have a stronger form called shireh which i understand to be filtered opium pipe resin the vendor has been pretty fast to answer my questions but there may be a slight language barrier it seemsyeah lol thanks so much ill watch that now i didnt think of trying to find videos or documentaries since im very text based but that is probably my best bet   i live in colorado so i already have a dab rig might try that ive heard of them for heroin but wasmt sure if opium would leave behind more residue
,,,dirtydruggiealt,black^opiates^opiate,somebody is selling eightballs or quarters or ounces to these guys with the 10 sacks meet that guy  craigslist is also a good bet black roofing tar and clear sealant are hot items  ive dealt with this too when i was copping on the street someone is out there you just have to look real hardthe first time i smoked meth was the best experience ive had with drugs maybe the best experience ive had ever it felt like my life was exactly what it should be even though i was homeless even having a history with opiates i had never felt my inner state go from fucked up and sad to absolutely ideal like it did after my second or third hit  its never been quite the samedoesnt feel as warm and safe as a strong opiate though ive never gotten a sense of complete relief from all my problems from weed if thats not what youre looking for in a drug or if weed really does it for you in that way lucky youdidnt have a scale one time i bought a piece of black for 40 that was bigger than i would expect at least half a gram but cut to complete trash i was shooting like 06 at the time to get high got as much as i could in the rig did the shot and woke up a couple hours later the other time i eyeballed it out of my homies 8ball but wanted to leave enough for him and got the same effect  even if i did weigh it out the lethal dose youll read about is the ld50 which means the dose that will kill over 50 of people theres still a good chance youll live if you go over its not an exact sciencethere is not a drug strong enough that we should withhold harm reduction in the name of not condoning it i dont need people on the internet to validate my drug use and tell me its okay to keep using none of these kids who are about to start using meth or heroin are going to have second thoughts and stop because you berate and dismiss them  its not like we dont know that they destroy peoples lives and the kids who come in here convinced that they arent going to get addicted to a super addictive drug because of how well they handle weed and alcohol and molly and coke or whatever get to have that belief because they think theyre invincible despite all the warnings and how badly it goes for a lot of people theres nothing you can do to change their mind thats not what theyre here for  granted its sometimes hard to advise people on how to do things safely if someone wants to know how to inject heroin without suffering health consequences we can tell them how to sanitize and hit a vein so they wont get an infection but we cant tell them how not to get into the depraved unhealthy lifestyles that a lot of people engage in after that its worth noting that for a lot of people basic selfcare falls out the window pretty quickly after certain lines are crossed   but thats not a reason to scold instead of giving support some people think its not worth teaching any harm reduction because drugs are categorically too dangerous to see any shades of gray one day its marijuana the next day youre boofing an entire bottle of codeine syrup and the next day youve got a permanent iv bag that you just drop heroin into all day best to avoid it altogether so were going to lie about marijuana being super dangerous   again if people heeded every warning they got it would save lots of lives but the warning sounds like bullshit so we use drugs anyway we just dont get any actual education on how to do things safely and reduce harm if someone has a friend who uses meth or opiates or whatever whos life isnt in the shitter you lose your credibility when you say those drugs are too risky and must be avoided at all cost there are also those who are depressed enough that they dont care and the ranting is lost on them too  if all you have to say about someone trying a drug is that they shouldnt do it and theyre an idiot for even asking youre not helpingif i used those id have to turn down most of the heroin i can get access to good idea for xanax users or anyone else who doesnt want a surprise opiate in their drugs though
,,,CSkarp,opiate^opiates^black,do you have a history of adhd tourettes physical anxiety heart issues of any kind for me it was hard getting it prescribed but originally i found it during opiate withdrawal in detox many years ago this stuff has so many uses you just have to have a reason other than to help your drug use lol to push for a prescriptionim actually planning to next month trust me ive tried its not something i brag about but its also good to make some light of the dark side that addiction really is if we cant do that we wont make it im an addict for life ive accepted that before stims it was opiates but ive been clean off them for 4 years see the time frame one to another  and that being said i sleep pretty much every day i eat i try and hydrate vitamins all that i can really to reduce the harmyeah been doing it for 4 years tried all kinds of pipes sizes lighters methods i still dont get how people can hold lighters to the pipe like smoking a brown or black puddle aint meth i think at a guess that bowl was under a point

,,,fuxwidyahard,opiate^opioid^opiates,i‚Äôve never understood how lean got so much hype around it codeine literally the shittiest opiate to ever be put on the market and promethazine antihistamine they give you for a tummy acheyes kratom is great depending on quality most of the time smoke shops carry some pretty bunk shit but i just recently picked up some very good quality red borneo from a local smoke shop and it‚Äôs a god send for these wd‚Äôs i‚Äôve been taking kratom daily for probably 2 years now i used it to quit my opioid habit i had and just never stopped but i did switch to some really low quality shit about a year ago just because it was what was available in my immediate area but now that i‚Äôm going through the benzo withdrawals idk if i could do it without having found this quality kratom and once you get totally over the benzo wd‚Äôs just cold turkey the kratom you‚Äôll see people say it‚Äôs hard to stop but it‚Äôs really not man if you can get off of benzos then putting kratom down cold turkey is a walk in the park a little runny nose and rls for like 3 days and then you‚Äôre as good as new i‚Äôve cold turkey‚Äôd off of 25g a day for months straight of quality kratom and it wasn‚Äôt even close to as bad as the withdrawal you get from a quick benzo taperbro you ever tried a benzo or hell even a muscle relaxer not that i recommend benzos they‚Äôre the only thing more evil than opiates but antihistamines are otc for a reason they don‚Äôt fuck you up promethazine is rx only but i‚Äôm not really sure why it‚Äôs no more sedating than doxylamine which is an otc antihistaminewell tramadol is an opioid not an opiate i‚Äôm unfortunately one of those people whose bodies metabolizes opioids very poorly so i‚Äôve never felt any effects from tramadol even at crazy doses and the only effects i‚Äôve ever gotten from codeine were hives and extreme itching i rate both drugs 010 well codeine 210 cause it literally just gives me an allergic reaction but still the point remains lean is dumb pop some percocet with some hydroxyzine and then you‚Äôre on mega lean lol it‚Äôs just a garbage drug that got hyped up through rap but seriously it seems like atleast one rapper who has tried lean and literally any other opioid would come out and be like ‚Äúyo lean aint shit try poppin like 2 percs and see for yourself‚Äùdo a cold water extraction on your percocethydrocodone if you plan on taking more than 4 the acetaminophen in these pills are actually more toxic than the opioids and if you‚Äôre using percocethydrocodone to get high you‚Äôre much more likely to od on the acetaminophen than the opioid i‚Äôll be honest i‚Äôve never done this because i‚Äôm reckless and don‚Äôt want to waste any of my drugs since i have a super high tolerance so i can‚Äôt remember the exact method but it‚Äôs very simple and you can just google cwe and find your step by step instructions  also i don‚Äôt iv but for all those people out there that do use a micron filter every timeyeah man and i see people recommending people benzos for opioid withdrawal all the time and it‚Äôs just the absolute worst advice if you got addicted to opioids chances are you‚Äôll get addicted to the benzos you‚Äôre using to kick the dope you can quit dope through sheer will power a lot of will power and it‚Äôs definitely tough but it‚Äôs nothing like benzo withdrawal it takes a lot more than will power to kick benzos glad you got off the oxy tho man and i wish you luck in kicking the benzo habit i‚Äôm currently on a taper using diclazepam because i‚Äôm one of the idiots who got himself an rc benzo addiction and it‚Äôs fucking tough i wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone but now that you‚Äôre in it just make sure you see your way through to the end man a life without any substance dependence truly is great i had it for about a year and it was awesome then relapsed and i‚Äôm back in shitsvilledo it man don‚Äôt expect the kratom to completely nullify your opioid withdrawal because it‚Äôs not going to do that but it will help a ton and with the right mindset it will make getting off the opioids 100x easier i used it for the very same reason it‚Äôs still going to be hard man so the most important thing is your mindset and your will to get clean don‚Äôt expect it to be easy and then say fuck it and get back on the hard stuff you‚Äôre life is going to be so much better if you get through this man i hope you‚Äôre able to do iti have an insanely high opiate natural tolerance i could take 200mg of oxy in one go and go to work or eat dinner with my family and no one could even notice turns out there‚Äôs some rare gene in some people with red hairred facial hair that causes this however opioids do still ‚Äúwork‚Äù on me i just need 10x what the average person needs maybe there is a similar gene that affects acts the same way but with benzos rather than opioids and maybe you have itagain not recommending it but if you like promethazine with opiates literally any benzo with opiates will blow your mind
,,,BagelKat24,opiate^opiates^opioid^opium,junky jesus did help me get it all haha i love having a good selection so what we got here   around the outside  a bunch of 12mcgh and 25mcgh fent patches on the left   one of each 5mcgh and 10mcgh buprenorphine  patch   four 8mg suboxone buprenorphine  a bag of 100mg and 300mg gabapentin not an opi they are for potentiating my doses   in the top part  3 15mgml liquid ivimsc morphine solution   100  1mg dilaudids   3 2mg dilly orange pills  in the little container with the green lid 5 more 2mg dilly and a 2mg clonazepam emergency container lol  the 2 white pills are 8mg dillys üíñ   in the container not all are counted from top to bottom and left to right  375mg325mg tramadolapap ultracet  10x 100mg tramadol er  next 2 slots are baclofen a muscle relaxer that has good synergy at low doses and i find it helps me sleep   next row   2mg loperamide imodium i believe it potentates opiates but i know it synergizes with alot and when taken in a higher dose with codeine can get you pretty high  in the same compartment 3x 25mg xanax  and 3x 15mg tampazepam i will assume you know how benzos work with opiates   10x 5mg percs   the pink ones are all the same 25mg diphenhydramine an antihistamine potentiates opiates good for getting rid of the itches when taken an hour or more before your dose ot can help get you alot high imo and depending on the opiate  orange pills in the bottom are 5mg clonazepam another benzo  and a point of coke in the green baggie for a rainy day lol  ‚úå‚úåi have heard of people baking oxys in the oven at low temps until its like a light sandy brown color and that is one method to making extended release into instant release  also i have heard of people putting crushed up oxys in cokepepsi over night and it makes it instant release and they just drink it and get a good buzz  i also feel like if you working try and make it a freebase kind of like what they do with crack that might work too but instead of sodium bicarbonate baking soda i believe you are supposed to use just sodium carbonate with opiates i assume doing something like that would get rid of the extended releaseim sorry if i didnt get a chance to reply to you on my other post yet but all of that support was so amazing and i was really fucked up last night been sleeping most of today but i had to say thank you this is a wonderful community we need a world of wonderful people like this  if you want to know what anything is just ask away  i know i got a couple non opiates tonight i got another free point of coke and traded buddy in need a 25mcg patch and threw is some clonazepam for 2 more 8mg dillys they were soooo damn good never had em before and damn i was wrecked last nightü§§with no tolerance to opiates at do not sniff more than a bump the size of a match head if ot could be fent then you could still od  so real oxycodone works really good if you eat it 90 bioavailability meaning if you take half a 30 your body would absorb most of the 15mg which if it is oxycodone will get you high or should if you sniff it the bioavailability is like 60 so you should get higher eating real oxycodone   fentanyl when eaten is 10 bioavailability but fentanyl when sniffed is 85 bioavailability so from what ive heard buddy was buying presses with 12mg of fent 10 of 6 is 06mg which can get you sort of high i assume because you have no tolerance but sniffed at 85 of 6mg is like 5mg absorbed and you will od and probably die especially without alot of immediate narcansdamn eh yea it takes alot of research sometimes  but that voltaren stuff should be good for aches while youre feeling sick  its real name is loperamide immodium is the brand name and is actually sold as diarrhea medication it is a derivative of demerol i believe it does bind to your brains opiates receptors but so slightly that you cant get high off it it will make you sleepy and it definitely help if you are experiencing withdrawals but it can also help if you are legitimately sick too lolyou sound like youre sick but it could be a little wds too they will make eachother worse my advice is to get loperamide imodium because it is a opioid derivative take like 4mg to start and benadryl dph and lots of apple juice and water because they will make you constipated get yourself a night time sleepy tea or a tea that has passion flower in it passionflower being a natural sedative   hope you feel better‚úåpapaver somniferum is the only type that produces opium you can only tell by the latin names check out rdruggardeningyes absolutely they are very different actually i cant explain it like a professional but i can explain it to the best of my ability which is pretty good imo   oxycodone is primarily synthesized from thebaine which is a dissociative type opiate naturally found in opium like codeine and morphine this actually gives oxy a more stimulating effect than most other opiods  hydromorphone is made from morphine in a similar way to heroin from what i understand however due to its unique nature it is very fast acting and sedating hydromorph is actually twice as strong as heroin per mg however it is not nearly as euphoric and very short lasting by comparison   oxy is very euphoric and longer lasting while providing excellent pain relief it is more stimulating than sedating hydromorph provides a stronger sedated pain relief that can cause euphoria and in my opinion is better for nodding and hydromorph has a unique intense rush to it because of its ability to pass the blood brain barrier quicker so when you inject it or boof it and even sometimes when sniffing for the first time it provides an amazing intensely euphoric rush that lasts minutes while you come up on the drug untill it reaches proper levels in your system and then you have a short lasting sedating euphoria afterwards  also bioavailability affects how you should take these to get the most out of then individually if you are interested in learning for about drugs and stuff check out the drug classroom on youtube he explains how alot of opiates work and their differences in very easy to understand ways sometimes it gets a little sciencey but it is normally understandable  hope this helps a bit‚úåi dont suggest moving to stronger opiates however for safety reasons i would recommend codeine or hydrocodone if a 300400mg dose of codeine doesnt get you feeling good you probably have a poor opiate metabolism also doses like that of codeine could give you stomach cramps and stuff so be prepared and definitely take a non drowsy ginger based gravolwhat i recommend for most people with tramadol is to use potentiators that way you can take less but stillget a great buzz also i believe tramadol has a ceiling dose meaning after a certain mg your body cant do anything with it like for example codeines ceiling is like 400mgs to get a better buzz you could take 2575 mgs of diphenhydramine benadryl or 250  500ml of pure grapefruit juice an hour before dosing it will help your liver produce more cyp2d6 which helps the body break down opiods helping the effect last longer and be stronger over all which means you can take less and still achieve the same high perscriptions like pregabalin or gabapentin can do wonders in helping potentiate because of the pain relief effects and synergy with opiates also i have found passion flower teas or bed time herbal teas found at the pharmacy most often do the for me at night to really get sleep can make the hour before bed a nod fest and a half   i just like to wish people caution with tramadol because of the seizure factor even tho it is a very low probability i warn more because i leanred that tramadol is very different from normal opiods and can have alot of different affects on the brain i like to help people learn there are lots of different tips and tricks we can do to safely enjoy our buzz better and make our product last longerüëç i myself love tramadol as well it has a wonderful euphoria and great affects for me i deff have the tramadol gene haha  have fun and stay safe sleepy sibling‚úåi boof morphine all the time 20mg first time will overwhelm you and make you sick especially being opiate naive i think that even just doing 10mg could overwhelm you you can always take more but never less and boofing is so much stronger than sniffing or eating it

,,,Sooooooorganic,opioid,let me reiterate a bit so this isn‚Äôt something i believe myself or rather really never thought about it i have always not believed a lot of the hype about addiction and always felt one can use and recover fine but just recently i was in the hospital non opioid related illness and the doctor started talking to me about suboxone i told him i would really only be interested in using suboxone to get through withdrawal and then stop taking it to avoid then having to taper off that he then went on to tell me essentially i have to be on one or the other  suboxone or dope otherwise i will not feel pleasure and likely relapse i just hate the idea of trading one for the other  quiting dope to go on subs if i get clean i want to be clean and allow my body to begin getting used to having nothing so ya i guess the doctor scared me a bit but i wanted to know if there is any truth to that i mean sometimes when i haven‚Äôt used in like 24 hour i already start to feel my senses and perception changing in the sense that things feel familiar like they did before i started using so if i can feel that way with just 24 hours off drugs i‚Äôd imagine weeks months years would do wonders but from the conversation i had with the doctor he essentially is saying no the doctor is saying i would need suboxone to essentially assist me back into life is this true or can i really just get off and start healing right away

,,,SusieSuze,black,i have my methods that make it super easy the base colour of my hair is predominately white the darker your hair the less vibrant the results henna does not open your cuticle to lighten your natural base colour there is no damage you cannot remove henna once it binds to the keratin in your hair you cannot bleach it it must grow out never apply chemical treatments such as perms relaxers dyes over henna results can be scary i‚Äôve heard   once you decide you want to keep doing henna for a year or more you can buy 1 kg bag of body art quality mehandi henna the indian grocer has it here in vancouver 8   put the whole bag in an extra large mixing bowl pour in a pot of extra strong black coffee bit by bit blend with hand mixer keep adding coffee until it becomes like a yogurt not like thick greek like the other style not payable but almost you may need more coffee so brew up some more and why not have a cup at this point i add about 14 to 13 cup of amla oil that i also buy in that grocery store it smells great and is a nice conditioner spoon into 46 containers and freeze of course don‚Äôt freeze until you‚Äôve used the first batch on your head fresh   the next time you henna take a container from the freezer and partially thaw it out in the microwave 5 minutes is probably enough just thaw enough to have a reasonable amount in the corners around the edges  use what you need and refreeze the rest one kg lasts a year or more for me   when applying the first time you need complete coverage use hair colour method of using a professional brush and 14 to 12 inch sections make sure to use a lot of product henna needs to really be thick especially around the edges of your face those darn sideburn hairs are often missed it took several times to realize i really needed to slather it on for it to cover properly   when needing your regrowth done just do the roots overlapping is never an issue you don‚Äôt need to pull the henna through you may want to do all over henna once every 36  months don‚Äôt be afraid of staining clothes carpets tiles or counters it all washes out henna only bonds with keratin in your skin nails and hair so don‚Äôt forget to wear gloves   wrap head with long pieces of plastic cling wrap until it is sealed in there really well i go way over the edges over my ears and almost my eyes do not let any hair be exposed as henna needs to be wet to work   leave in for 3 hours and get in the shower with gloves on and rinse rinse rinse until the water is clear then shampoo then condition clean your ears really well because it often has crept it‚Äôs way into the crannies hopefully you have a shower head with a hose so you can wash the shower enclosure easily   wrap a towel on your pillow until you‚Äôve had a couple of more chances to shampoo or condition your hair don‚Äôt wear white tshirts with wet hair for a week or two what rubs or drips off won‚Äôt stain permanently so don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs just a bit of a nuisance   if you want to cover grey and you like bright copper hair henna is miracle i worked for an international hair colour brand and taught hair stylists how to use that colour i used the best products i know hair colour and nothing beats henna grey coverage 100 amazing   no fading unless you spend a crazy amount of time in the sun you will not notice any colour difference after 3 weeks of every day in the sun for hours in spain it faded a bit but still looked glorious   cheap a year of colouring my own hair would have cost me about 350 and that‚Äôs at wholesale price of professional colour henna is 8 plus coffee   natural non toxic non polluting   hope this helps someonei have my methods that make it super easy  once you decide you want to keep doing henna for a year or more you can buy 1 kg

,,,thelemonx,opioid^dreams^black,well i have a rather unusual opioid story  i have been prescribed narcotics for the entirety of my adult life  initially they were for chronic orthopedic pain  that issue was resolved surgically after 15 years  i thought i was done with pain and pain pills  not long after i started to get used to a life without pain i severely burned  i still had a significant tolerance  in the burn unit i told them i was opioid tolerant and the medication wasnt working very well  they increased my dose and dosing frequency until it achieved satisfactory pain relief  i didnt even get a chance to fully heal from the fire when i got diagnosed with brain cancer  the location of my tumor causes central pain syndrome which for me manifests as constant pain throughout my lower body  they thought i would only live a short while but im still here and unfortunately i still hurt  again typical starting doses didnt cut it  i told my doctors  they increased the dose  most of the time i can actually forget that i even have cancer all of my symptoms are adequately treatedi have 9 year old twin sons who are much kinder and more understanding than i was at that age  2 years ago i had surgery to remove part of a brain tumor  not long after i got home one of my boys said to me dad want to know what my favorite thing in the world is  when were going for a walk cooking supper folding clothes and we just talk to each other  i replied your favorite thing in the world is talking to your dad  my heart melted  he is a very kind boy  earlier this winter he came home from school and he said can we get a new pair of mittens next time we go to town  my friend doesnt have any  last summer the other boy shocked me  out of the blue he said dad want to know my favorite thing about people is  every person has their own story where they came from where theyre going and their own hopes and dreams    they have a level of kindness and empathy i wouldnt expect from most adults let alone childreni have nearly died 5 times now  1 i was camping with some friends back in high school  i decided to sneak up on them by crawling under a truck  i was under the front drivers tire when the truck started backing up on me  thankfully she immediately hit the brakes shifted into drive instead of running me over the rest of the way  i had a tire mark on my back for months after but im still alive   this one felt different than the others  the other 3 times i was slowly dying this one would have been very abrupt but it didnt happen so i never had the light at the end of the tunnel or anything like that  one second i was being run over then i wasnt  2 my wife ended a relationship to be with me  this guy wasnt too happy about this  she and i got married 2 years later  shortly after our wedding we saw her ex at a bar  he asks me to come outside alone to apologize for 2 years of harassing us and threatening me  i should have known better  next thing i know i get hit on the back of my head and someone is holding me down choking me  my vision was fading to black light at the end of the tunnel and all that  for a moment i conceded that i was simply going to die  as the last bit of light fades out i somehow managed to find the strength to get them off of me  my wife had heard the fight and she came out to help someone else grabbed her to keep her from helping me  once i got up i was able to help her  we ran to our car and sped away  later we found out that her ex had paid 2 people to kill me  and to make it even worse the price to end my life is only 50 worth of meth this one scared the shit out of me but in the moment i was fading into the black i felt a calm peace then found strength that i didnt know i was capable of and that strength is what allowed me to survive  3 i had burned my foot and leg in a brush fire and needed skin graft surgery  the day after my surgery i had a fever obviously from an infection  my nurse kept coming in and checking my temperature and it kept going up  they changed my bandages and put on more antibiotic cream  temp went up higher  they changed bandages again and tried a different antibiotic cream  temp went higher  they changed bandages again and gave me oral antibiotics  temp went higher  they changed it all again and gave me iv antibiotics  again my temp went up  once more they changed everything and increased the iv  i heard someone say hes at 416 107f for those who prefer fahrenheit as i started to fade out  i was convinced that this was going to be the end of me  i closed my eyes to picture my wife and kids and to pray for them to carry on without me  i open my eyes and my room filled with glowing light  a nurse came in whispered youre going to be alright in my ear and left  i felt an all encompassing comfort and knew i was ok  my real nurse came in to take my temp and it was back to normal  a few i put nurse in quotes because the woman i described to my previous nurse does not exist     the actual moment close to death was the same as before  just a calm peace  like i knew it wasnt my time but when that time did come it would be ok  4 a year and a week after the fire i had my 4th surgery on the burn  the next day i had a terrible headache and i was unable to keep any food or liquid down  each day the headache gets worse  it eventually gets to be unbearable  the one time i look up my symptoms on webmd it tells me i have brain cancer i shrug it off thinking theres no way  i told my wife this headache hurts more than being on fire did  she convinces me to go to the doctor  i thought it was just leftover effects from anesthesia and i planned to just power through  i go to the doctor and he thinks the same thing gives me iv fluids and a steroid shot and sends me on my way  the next day i go back  when i told him that the headache was waking me up in the night he ordered a ct scan  a headache should never wake you up  ct shows a mass in my brain  he makes an appointment at a larger hospital for the next day and i have surgery to remove part of the tumor the following day  something bad happened during the surgery so i woke up in the icu instead of the room i started in  i dont remember what it was that happened but they were unable to give me any pain medication after surgery because it could have masked the brain damage they were afraid might have happened  i was at the lowest point of my life i had never felt pain anywhere close to this it was so painful that i actually believed i was dying  just like in the burn unit a year prior i closed my eyes and imagined my wife and kids and i prayed that they would be ok without me  i open my eyes and my room is glowing bright again  the same nurse from the burn unit came into my room and told me i was going to be alright  as she left i felt that same comfort throughout my entire being and i knew i was going to be ok   again just that same calm peace  5 this spring i was in northern minnesota  i go up there with my wifes uncles for our annual guys fishing trip  i am a photographer so i spend part of the trip by myself in a canoe looking for spots to take pictures  i do the same thing every year but this year i put on a lifejacket before heading out  after a while i decide to head in for lunch  the wind made it very difficult to get to where i wanted to go  long story short i end up tipping the canoe   for a short while i was able to hold my upper body out of the water but the wind picked up again and i lost hold of the canoe  i dont know the exact water temperature but there was still ice on the lake 6 days earlier so it was in the upper 30s to lower 40sf  the shore seemed impossibly far away and my strength was fading fast  for a moment i considered unbuckling my life jacket to let myself sink to the bottom  i figured quickly drowning would be better than slowly freezing to death  i close my eyes and in my mind i saw a recent picture i had taken of my wife and kids  i decided i wasnt going to freeze or drown i was going to get out about 50 yards from shore i stopped shivering and felt nice and warm  for a moment i thought i was just in shallow water and it actually was warm then i remembered that this was the end stages of hypothermia  i give my last strength to get to shore  i get to shore in neckdeep water  i grabbed hold of some reeds to try and pull myself out  i pulled on them 3 times  i was too weak to get out  this time i was convinced i was going to die right then and there  everything was fading to black again i saw the light at the end of the tunnel but this time unlike the others the tunnel closed  a moment later the blackness turned to white and i was sitting on shore  i will never be convinced that this wasnt divine   after a while i think to take off my clothes to get that cold water off of my skin  it took every ounce of my strength to get undressed  i realized that i was barely breathing tried to check my pulse but it was too weak to count  it was sunny and 82f but i was laying there dying  i finally think that i should be yelling for help  everyone else was in the cabin having lunch  everyone except for my wifes cousin he was fishing off of the dock  he went inside and said i think i hear someone yelling for help  somehow he heard me from over half a mile away  nobody questioned him they all got on the boat to look around  hearing the sound of that motor filled me with joy unlike anything id ever felt  i was lying in the reeds and with my clothes off i blended right in  i tried to sit up to make sure they saw me but i couldnt move hypothermia was closing its icy grip   they found me when they saw the canoe floating nearby  again i tried to get up but i couldnt  they had to pick me up and put me in the boat  we got back to the cabin and they carried me off the boat  i had them put me in a chair in the sunshine they found my warmest clothes and put them on me  i had one of the guys make me a pot of tea nothing on this earth will ever taste as good as that first sip of warm tea   that cold water was by far the most terrifying experience of my life  none of the others come anywhere close in comparison  but that moment when i was right up to the line of dying i was filled with that same peace and comfort as before  tldr i have come close to death 5 times in my life  3 of them were within the last 3 years   for 4 of them the neardeath part was very similar  i was slowly progressing toward death my vision was fading to black i saw the light at the end of the tunnel the moment i start coming back to my senses i was filled comfort and peace far beyond anything else  each time i somehow knew that it wasnt my time but when my time comes it will be ok the other event was different  while the other 4 were like a dimmer switch with me fading into the dark this was just onoff  i didnt experience anything unusual this time  edit  formattinghydroxyzine does potentiate opioids  just a note potentiation

,,,TATP1982,opiates^opioid,for someone with no dependency who has never had one on opiates  there will not be any withdrawals  for someone who used to be dependent there could be mild withdrawal symptoms  even after two years of clean time  once that pathway is created the brain is able to find it again pretty much right awayno taking your normal dose wont really help so the best course of action is to avoid getting pwd in the first place  always take small doses of buprenorphine 1 to 2 mg increments every two hours that way if you do start to feel worse it wont be nearly as severe and it will go away relatively quickly  in order to reverse pwd you would have to take a monsterous amount of what ever your doc is and that may not even work plus its very dangerous to do so   buperenorphine has a higher binding affinity than almost everything except fentanyl and hydromorphone buprenorphine also has a much lower intrinsic activity  its this change in activity that causes pwd so when the bupe rips the full agonist off the receptor and replaces it there is a very rapid down regulation of opioid activity  that is felt as severe withdrawalmaybe mild  but it might not be since you have a previous dependance on opiates that pathway gets reactivated fairly quickly it will probably not be anywhere near as bad as it was the first time you detoxed but expect a few days of feeling like shiteits the other way around  opiates after sub receptors are blocked and nothing happens sub after opiates within the last 24 hours pwd

completely opiate naive ie you haven‚Äôt used opiates prior and have no tolerance 23 may honestly get you buzzed or even get you smacked  5 in such a case may push you to the point of nausea and puking nausea is extremely common with opiates especially with those who are opiate naive  i‚Äôd say start with 23 3 probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt you then wait about 1530 minutes  if you are opiate naive as it seems you are you should feel a warming buzz and euphoria  see where you‚Äôre at after 1530 minutes and if it hasn‚Äôt produced the desired effect or not enough of it layer on another 12  then repeat this cycle until you‚Äôre at where you want to be  good luckjust to clear this up from my other comment since it seems like a lot of folks don‚Äôt know this afghan heroin doesn‚Äôt really appear in the us anymore mostly just the eu uk and asia  it is almost always brown and almost always 3 heroin base  tar is pretty exclusive to the us as it‚Äôs almost exclusively made in mexico as its garbage  it‚Äôs the result of poor and incomplete processingrefinement  the brown 4 in the us is primarily from colombia with a small portion produced in mexico  white ‚Äúheroin‚Äù in the us is almost always fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue  this is because the only area that produces truly pure white really off white heroin that is actual heroin is sea mostly thailand and the shan state  most of that heroin stays in asia with some of it making it to the rest of the world oddly enough the primary destination being canada  and there you have it  that is how the origins of today‚Äôs heroin breakdown  if you‚Äôre asking what people like better between the american options you‚Äôre really asking about mexican bth brown or black tar colombian 4 brown or synthetic canadian or mexican 4 white and greyi‚Äôve heard 2425 but everyone is different  i‚Äôm mega against vivitrol to be honest  i have a turbo bad reaction to naltrexone ultra depression maximum malaise and general notgivingafuckedness  from those i‚Äôve heard who‚Äôve used it ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù though somewhere between day 20 and day 25 they describe the exact same feeling they can literally feel it wearing off and they often tell me that they get the worst cravings they‚Äôve ever had seemingly worse than before they got the shot oddly enough  i‚Äôve had a few friends actually die because they were on naltrexone they hit day 2025 they got turbo cravings and then rather than getting a new shot they went the fuck it route banged a mud shot their tolerance had dropped to nothing and they ended up cold slabbed and toe tagged  i honestly believe that if you‚Äôre going to use mat or recommend mat for that matter it should be a mat solution that actually addresses the craving directly and on a regular preferably daily basis  since diacetylmorphine isn‚Äôt available for mat anymore in most of the world that leaves methadone and suboxone  i honestly believe methadone is a trap and most methadone users would be better off with heroin but suboxone actually seems like a very strong and reasonable approach  i‚Äôm on it now and doing well and while i haven‚Äôt been on it long i was on it before successfully for over a year  i not only lived a productive and socially acceptable life i didn‚Äôt use illicitly and i was able to taper off without withdrawals literally the only opiate i‚Äôve ever been able to taperthey weren‚Äôt invented in canada you dolt they were dyed in canada so people could tell the difference between the different fentanyl analogues  fentanyl is produced in canada because it is easy to get the precursors there from china  it is not always cut with caffeine either  china white isn‚Äôt a term exclusive to canada though  it existed long before canada had fent long before fent was on the scene  it was originally used to describe pure heroin which is whitesuch heroin only really comes from sea thus the china bit  anyone on here will tell you i know a fuckton more about fent fent analogues and heroin in general than you can ever hope to so stop giving out bad information and go back to sipping your leanyes almost definitely from mexico  almost all tar comes from mexico  tar is a crappier product than 3 or 4 as tar is the result of an incomplete refinement process  as a result black tar typically maxes out at 30 heroin which is why i was saying it is inherently not fire  afghan dope while afghanistan produces somewhere between 6070 of the world‚Äôs opium is very very rarely seen outside of asia and europe  it is just about the only thing you‚Äôll find in the uk and eu but finding it in the us is rarer than finding a sober hobo  additionally afghani opium is refined into heroin in a handful of places primarily pakistan  almost all of the afghani opium that is refined into heroin is turned into heroin base 3  i don‚Äôt like speaking in absolutes as one never knows but i can fairly confidently say that none of afghani opium is turned into bth  all that comes together into forming my point that just by reading the post and seeing the picture rather safely inferring that op is in the us and acquired bth of some variety it is almost certainly neither bang dope nor afghani which is to say the original commenter has no fucking clue what he‚Äôs talking about  unfortunately that seems to be an epidemic on this sub these days though

,,,Stressed_Deserts,opiates,the other poster is a fucking idiot using scare tactics  you really should consult a doctor and there have been plenty of healthy babies born when edit my wife went cold turkey as soon as she found out example my wife we have a wonderful set of 9 year old twins doing completely fine also a 4 year old both times she was either on subs or opiates and went cold turkey we also have a 2 year old where they recommended she stay on the subs the whole time really talk to a doctor get pre natal care and dont worry about some internet crusader trying to scare people because they have low self esteem or insane religious beliefs or they are plain fucking dumb
,,,___PaSta___,opiates^black^china,not really why people take acid tbh i guess its different for everyone but iv never dropped acid to feel good in fact its always pretty uncomfortable even if its worth  it overall if you wanted to feel good you would take opiates and mdmastill dont you think its unrealistic to make the legal age 25 it would just lead to the black market for weed continuing which defeats the whole point of legalisation the biggest market is for people aged 2025 also brain development is different for different people some people dont finish brain development until 30 should we make the age 30 to protect those people i feel like once you are an adult you should be responsible for your own dumb decisions and no government should get to say what someone may or may not consumeoutbreak was in china anyone who pretends to know how many people are infected are silly if you think for a second china wouldnt try to hide how severe the situation is you are naive when a chemical explosion kills thousands they pretend 40 people diedyeah just like with other opiates pissing becomes harder on kratom not a big deal though and still easier than pissing on morphine

,,,kollaps3,dreams^opiate^black^opiates,aww these are adorable you had the liberty spikes of my 14 year old dreams you look like one of the girls id see at a show back in 07 and be sooo intimidated by but also wanna be best friends with üòÇ also from one punk lady to another you are gorgeousholy shit a lot of your situation sounds really similar to mine my man and i also got clean together and we had tried many times before and it never worked but we have both been on suboxone as prescribed and dope free for nearly 10 months now we also live in the same neighborhood as our old dealer in fact we live in the opiate capital of our country but we also were the kind of junkies who could sniff out dope in like a small town in the mountains so we kind of realized the place isnt gonna matter theres always gonna be dope on almost every corner and baggies all over the subway stations so its more about completely shifting your attitude until you just no longer see opiates as an option ever sounds insanely difficult i know but if my bundle a day shooting ass can do it i know you got this too üíú  you sound like your head is really in the right place and its so difficult to stay away from using when life is throwing all these problems out of your control at you and you just have the urge to slap the band aid of dope on it but through acceptance exactly what you said you can get through it im so proud of you girl getting to nearly a week is amazing i totally know what you mean about the cooking breakfast and doing fun sober people shit its so nice to be able to appreciate those little things again im so glad this sub has been able to be of such help to you my first few months clean this place was basically my version of going to meetings every day lol much love to you and keep it upmorning yall ive been slacking hard on making check ins andor stickying them among other minor stuff and i gotta be better about that im sorry üò£ this might be a long one but let me try and make it shorter    a few pertinent things    1 r has somehow become way more aware of and better with his behavior and overall demeanor he said this to me last night almost word for word after i reacted to him being annoyed about something that had nothing to do with me by instantly apologizing you should never have to feel that way you shouldnt have to thank me for treating you nicely or not freaking out on you that should be the norm and you shouldnt be constantly worried that things out of your control will make me angry and youll be responsible for fixing them for me because thats not your problem and i shouldnt make it your problem and im sorry for making it that way in the pasti promise i will do better in the future     of course i cant fully believe him cuz i dont fully believe anyone when they tell me theyre going to do something but hes been staying true to his word the other night he came home really angry about some shit he had 100 every right to be angry about in fact i was furious for him but the kicker was he didnt take it out on me at all he actually vented to me not at me afterwards i told him how much i appreciate him not getting angry at me and he got really ashamed and said that i shouldnt have to appreciate it that should just be what always goes on makes me realize how fucked up my head really is in terms of relationships that bare minimum respectful treatment that normal people require as a baseline from their partner seems to me like some special extra nice behavior    2 some fucking person took all of my appt slots with my therapist for the next two months and i know that 90of the ppl that go there are unemployed so im betting its some fucker who has other options while for me that is literally the only time that will work with my schedule and i really do not know what to do im kind of freaked out and pissed off its kind of like the clean version of my dealer being out of town for two months or some shit lmao but for real im pissed idfk what im gonna do    3 so for years and years my favorite music was black metal but around 2017 when i started getting really badly strung out i stopped listening to it for the most part and barely have since then but the other day after reading my old journal it reminded me of this one song i used to really love so i went to listen to it and from there it was just like the flood gates of 3 years of not listening to my favorite music just opened and holy shit it was just an amazing feeling i feel like it helps remind me of myself before i ever got strung out and before i put myself in truly miserable dangerous situations and it just makes me feel less numb    ight imma wrap this shit up now lol that was about as brief as it was gonna get considering all the shit thats been on my mind lately im at school rn got my first class in like 40 min i got my rag while i was at work yesterday and last night had miserable cramps that woke me up out of sleep but im feeling at least good enough to get out of bed today and my rule is if i have the strength to leave my bed no matter how shitty i may feel otherwise then i have the strength to go about my day really not having it mentally today though lol i actually like talk to kids in class this semester but today i really dont wanna have none of that lol well love you guys always grateful for this space and yall putting up with me running my mouth hope everyone has a good thursday üíúi started hanging out in the punk scene at a very young age in my city nyc also grew up hearing stories of the london punk scene from my mom read a bunch of books and stuff about it starting from like age 10 all of which had heavy mentions of heroin use before i even started going to shows at age 13ish so i was curious about heroin from the time i was literally a child     saw a lot of my older friends use during my young teenage years and while i would fuck w prescription opiates every now and then and loved every minute of it i already knew deep down that as soon as i touched heroin it would become a huge problem for me at age 1517 i went thru two abusive relationships back to back the second with a recovering addict 9 years my senior that shit really tore me up inside and when i moved from the west coast where i was living with him back to nyc right before i turned 18 the minute i had an opportunity to do dope which was pretty soon considering how many of my friends used i did it     i rode freight trains around north america for a few years after that and got strung out in a few different cities the worst of it in vancouver bc all that time i was still only snorting at age 19 i got clean no mat and stayed completely clean i drank and smoked weed but no hard drugs for a little over two years in that time i got into surprise surprise another abusive relationship and this one was really really bad towards the end of it i started using weekly then after we broke up i got with my current boyfriend who was a very bad addict and thats when i started shooting it that as we know is a whole different ball game    a lot of awful things had happened in my life and for 2 years all i did was shoot up about it my life was in fucking ruins and i was homeless for a lot of this time ended up getting my shit together april 2019 and despite it being like the 20th time trying suboxone it actually worked for me that time the 18th of this month ill be 9 months clean im on 12mg subday and smoke weed before i go to bed but thats it my boyfriend who had a really rough upbringing and was strung out for the better part of the last decade has also been completely clean since april     i still follow this sub cuz im really devoted to harm reduction and helping out my fellow junkies cuz just because im clean doesnt mean im gonna leave those that could use my or anyones help or support behind cuz its triggering to me or some shit heroin was such a constant shadow over my shoulder even before i ever used for a good decade of my life a little while ago i found a diary entry from age 12 saying as much as i didnt want it to be true and knew all the dangers i knew i would do dope one day shit is crazy but im just so grateful to be free of it i have a job i like and am currently in school working towards my degree which i never thought would happen cant get complacent cuz the demon is always just over your shoulder but im happy and grateful to be where im at now

,,,robertkorozsi,opiate^opiates^opioid,aww i viewed your profile i thought you are against opioid use in the case like mine i really have a lot of broken bones internal bleeding was stopped by surgery bruised bladder metal screws in my tibia on y right hand radius and ulna is broken aswell 3 broken ribs a lot of contusions all over my body the back of my scull had a fracture and i am facing at least 3 months recovery so like it hurts it fucking hurts even with this 10mg oxy i have some but after i saw your profile correct me please if i got it wrong you are not against opiate use if it is unevitable like sufffer in pain or focus on your recoveryyes coke was my fiance at least in the honemoon phase now i get it that shit opiates are a way different territory i am an addictive personality so i have to be really cautious now and here you cant buy pills off the street if i would abuse the hell out of these 30 pills and aybe got addicted than straight to heroine so i keep it on the minimum and i hope that i under y fathers supervision get the best out of it  btw  i am still itchy as hellyes i totally agree with you i was addicted to cocaine i used it for six years the same reason  angry anxious depressed angry and introverted i quit coke twoyears ago also i did not drink when using coke cause that keep me in the line all day woke up the first thing i did was a heavy line and at the evening i coped with the comedown with overdosing benzos acruqlly i am still tapering off the benzodiazepines coke was not that hard to stop it jist took a lot of time not to relapse  anyway this is the first time my body met with qn opioid also at the hospital i am sire they gave me morphine but i know what is happening overseas and i dont need another addirction i am still into benzo tapering that is why i gave my supply to my father only keeping 10 tablets with me and even i am in pain and it takes 30 minutes to pee and somehow go to the bathroom i have a really calm and uplifted euphoric mood so yes i could not imagine what it would do on a high dose  our brain is just not wired for it üòä

,,,cleanslateslut,dreams^opiate^opiates,my husband sleeps naked or in underwear one day at 4 am  a drunk guy hit out car in our driveway next to our bedroom window and tried to leave his car was too messed up though i always sleep with clothes because i have 2 kids and i need to be ready for whatever so i hop out of bed and see what‚Äôs going on and my husband comes out with his phone in is undies he wasn‚Äôt vulnerable or hesitant at all just recording and yelling at dude  i‚Äôm now convinced it‚Äôs fine be naked and run around in an emergency i will deal with midnight puking and bad dreams and he can deal with drunk guys at 4 amthe bubble of numb yes but also it works like an anti depressant in a way your body won‚Äôt produce dopamine naturally anymore and the opiate replaces it it gets regular eventually and some people need medication but our bodies are very accepting to opiates as humansthe more i think about it  the further back it goes i‚Äôve always chased a rush i climbed trees as tall as my house at age 45 because i was so good at it i got a little rush from the risk and confidence combo in 6th grade a lot of kids were smoking weed and cigarettes so i tried some from my moms ashtray and got a big headrush i started choking myself to pass out because it was such a rush my uncle started paying me in beer and cigarettes to babysit his kids when i was 14 by 15 i was full on smoking cigarettes and weed every day then i got a fake id at age 15 and was buying beer and cigarettes for everyone then i got my wisdom teeth pulled and loved the pills then i would go to festivals and get acid mushrooms or x and thought i gained more insight of my mind than was possible sober then i dated a guy older than me so he was going out to bars all the time and i would tag along with my fake id then we became codependent then i had a pretty heavy pill habit that eventually lead to heroin then i quit opiates because i realized how dumb it was but i started doing coke instead i would do any drug at that point i then started struggling with major neck pain and was prescribed a lot of pills i started using heroin again when i would run out early then i got into treatment and did suboxone maintenance then relapsed a month after my successful taperthen i got on methadone and stayed on it for 7 years i was ok with doing it for the rest of my life but i recently got off of that because of all the work i was able to do while stable on a program i‚Äôm feeling a lot better about having control and i don‚Äôt want to use i think i‚Äôm prone to addiction because of mental illness and family history knowing what i know now at 35 i will definitely take my kids straight to rehab if they start going down that path i did i wish i went to rehab earlier in life
,,,Forsaken-Tax,opioid,tramadol is a real opioid im well aware about its properties and anything other than that is unfortunately extremely expensive here 1 pill 5mg oxy for 40 when i can get 100x100mg tramsdol for 110 im also well aware about the wd but theyre not as severe as all the others
,,,Macadamia1,opiates^opiate,most pharmacies actually all pharmacies  in canada  have signs on the door that say ‚Äúwe do not stock opiates we pickup upon request only‚Äù  but if your saying that you got thousands at a time then either 1 the usa needs to adopt that program  or 2 the signs are a lie to deter theft and they actually do stock opiates  just a question if you don‚Äôt mind  did you demand ‚Äúall the opiates‚Äù or just the oxy‚Äôs   i mean since your there anyway might as well get all the opiates  i probably would have asked for all the testosterone benzo‚Äôs adhd meds cialisviagara anti estrogens thyroid pills basically everything with street value lol  however i understand if you only robbed them or their oxy‚Äôs  i can attest to being so deep in addiction you don‚Äôt see the big picture  however at my most desperate of times i adopted a mindset of ‚Äúanything will do‚Äù rather than tunnel vision on my drug of choice so i probably would have cleaned the place out of everything they had with valuei actually got really fortunate and got my hands on some gabapentin  pregabalin so those are going to help take 90 of the withdrawals away once i eventually jump off   for once i was able to put all the connections i made during my addiction to good use lmao  i have been using the gabapentin on days i lower my dose for example  monday  20mg am  20mg lunch  20mg pm  tuesday  15mg  300 gpent am 15mg  300 gpent lunch 15mg  300 gpent pm  wednesday 15mg  200 gpent am 15mg  200 gpent lunch 15mg  200 gpent pm  thursday 15mg  100 gpent am 15mg  100 gpent lunch 15mg  100 gpent pm  frisay 15mg am 15mg lunch 15mg pm  so this has helped more than i could ever explain but i‚Äôve had to be real careful not to get hooked on gabaoentin they are prescribed in detox centres and rehab houses across north america i have searched reddit and there‚Äôs countless members of the opiate recovery community here that credit gabapentin and pregabalin for helping them get through withdrawals but there‚Äôs also an ex tire community of people trying to get off gabapentin and pregabalin too so i‚Äôve been careful not to take it more than a few days in a  row and then i take at least 7 days before taking the gabaoentin again  honestly i feel like they help so much that i could jump off and only feel 10 the withdrawals but i have a 2 week holidays scheduled from work in 2 months   so i‚Äôm going to continue my tape and come off then  if you can find either of these drugs i can‚Äôt urge you enough to try them but use them wisely i took too much the first day i had them cuz  duh i‚Äôm an addict what else would i do lol and i felt drunk basically so i‚Äôll never take 600mg again lol  but if use correctly they are apparently the best drug out there for curing withdrawals once we eventually jump off  sorry to hear that you went backwards in your taper keep chipping away brother  cheershey  i have come clean once before i used clonodine but found that i couldn‚Äôt stay away after taking it so i only used it at night and i don‚Äôt like e idea of my blood pressure dropping right before i go to bed since that is what‚Äôs making me tired from the clonodine is the blood pressure drop i have a  bp machine at home as my gf is a nurse and my bp got dangerously low after taking it she was waking me up during my last detox and taking my bp after taking clonodine and it was like 7540 so dangerously low   so i‚Äôm going to pass on that for now  i am actually wanting to take a more  aggressive approach to my taper that‚Äôs why i asked about using gabapentin because i thought maybe i could make larger jumps than just a 2mg decrease  dropping from 150mg per to day 60 only took 2 weeks but that‚Äôs cuz i had such a huge dose so it‚Äôs getting harder now  for sleep i‚Äôm not sure what i‚Äôm going to do the gabaoentin will take away the restless legs i used it last time but only had 10 pills and spread them out and damn they helped i picked up 20 x 75mg pregabalin today so i‚Äôm going to use that the first 5 days and then use gabapentin for the next 10 and then come off hopefully i won‚Äôt get too addicted  i also have tons of vitamin c kratom and 200 loperamide on hand but i wanna stay away from the latter 2 as their just opiates and combining them with gaba or pregabalin will probably get me high lol  i‚Äôve actually started working out 6 days a eeek and eating real healthy during the taper because i thjnk a healthier body will  an easier detox it only makes sense that the better shape ur body is in the better it will perform under the stress of detox i competed in bodybuilding shows and actually made it out of the regional level and onto the state level before my addiction so it was easy for me to pick it back up and hit the weights and the 67 daily small high protein meals again since i have the knowledge and muscle memory already established i‚Äôm hoping that will help me sleep a good workout  lots of vitamins  fish oils  coq10  pro biotics none of them directly aid sleep but i‚Äôm praying that a healthier body will fall asleep eaiser it‚Äôs a stretch but from what i‚Äôve read the restless legs and anxiety  jitters at night are caused by nutrition deficiencies mainly magnesium but some others  my doc gave my mirapex for restless legs so that  pregab  gaba should take care of the rls but i would love a medication for sleep weed makes me sketchy and anxious and i freak out  i used to use motion sickness tabs but those cause rls to get worse during withdrawal so i don‚Äôt know what to use  melatonin is useless and i can‚Äôt get any benzos only thing that works is clonodine for me and i can get that but like i said it knocks me out in a dangerous way  sorry for rambling any suggestions for otc sleep meds or even prescription ones i could always ask around the one good thing about being an addict is that when u wanna quit you know where to find all the comfort meds ahahai was not meaning i‚Äôd completely replace an opiate dose with gabaoentin i was  referring to mixing them  throughout the day here‚Äôs an example   i‚Äôm just trying to think of a way to implement the gaba it seems silly to have access to this amazing drug  yet still suffer withdrawals when i lower my dose during my taper  day 1 hydro 6mg x 5  day 2 hydro 6mg x 5  day 3 hydro 4mg x 5 but take 300mg with each dose  day 4 repeat  day 5 repeat  day 6 hydro 4mg x 5 without gabapentin    so basically when i want to lower my dose i will add gabapentin for the first 23 days  cu gaba potentials the opiates a wd‚Äôs i may feel and then after a few days i will cut the gaba and just do my new dose of hydros   and a few weeks later i‚Äôll repeat lower my hydro dose and add 300mg gaba with each dose when i‚Äôm lowering it until i‚Äôm comfortable then take away the gaba this way i can lower my opiate dose with wd‚Äôs along the way   would this work or no gaba potentials opiates that‚Äôs why i am thinking of adding them to my dose whenever i lower my dose so i can potentials the new lower dose for the first few e days and stop the gaba once my body is used to the new dose  it makes sense in theory loli‚Äôve had 4 friends taper suboxone and when they all jumped off  every last one of them told me ‚Äúthis naked opiate detox look like a vacation‚Äù it lasted 3040 days for them and they all relapsed after a month i‚Äôd rather take the opiate detox of 34 days lol everythint i read on forums says the same that suboxone is 100x worse when u come off but i appreciate the suggestion thank you

,,,NurdBurglar,opiate^opiates,i‚Äôm very experienced with opiates although i‚Äôve not dabbled in them in years because honestly it gets bad fast so i def know the difference in oxy etc and kratom but while kratom is a weak high it still effects some of the same receptors neurologically and while it is an opioid agonist rather than an opiate i still think there is going to be a level of cross tolerance i suspect it will be minimalyeah you‚Äôd prob say i have a ‚Äòlow‚Äô tolerance and i can see how it must work really well as a treatment to help someone step off opiates i‚Äôm not a heavy user  i was 6 months ago and off and on here and there it got off the wagon for a couple of days then i get back on it  my tolerance is enough that i snorted 12mg this morning and am feeling pretty nice i mean it‚Äôs not like oxy it‚Äôs a peculiar drug  and i‚Äôm not necessarily trying to get an oxy type buzz from because i know that‚Äôs not how it works   sounds like what i hear you saying is beyond that initial 12 mg to do anymore would be a waste right  8 don‚Äôt have a ton of them so i‚Äôm not gonna be using it daily for a long time just experimentingi‚Äôve got a pretty high opiate tolerance at this point in my life but i just haven‚Äôt used suboxone ever until recentlycertainly yesterday morning i started really small like 2 mg i know lots of ppl suggested 1 mg or less but i don‚Äôt think they understand that kratom regardless of your opinion of it was going to have some degree of cross tolerance 9 am 2mg felt nothing noon did 4 mg more at this point i could tell something was in my system but it was of now recreational value around 4 pm did 4mg more again could sense an opiate but ever so mildly  this morning i started w 12 mg all at once up ye ole sniffer there was definitely a degree of recreational value in this dose but it wasn‚Äôt anything to write home about around 3 sniffed another 8mg and that was the end of my supply if i had more then tomorrow morning i probably would have tried 16 or 20 mg at once   long story short even though kratom is weak a high tolerance to it must give you a high tolerance to the other actual opiates  in the end i actually enjoy a dose of 25mg kratom over the 12mg of bupesorry there is more to that story i thought i was replying on a different sub i didn‚Äôt start off trying 12 mg first day i tried 2 mg and didn‚Äôt feel nothing at all then tried 8 felt a little bit then today 12mg and it was ok   i‚Äôm basically out of it now i just happened across 4 pills and was really hoping to get some recreational value out of them and i didn‚Äôt know if kratom tolerance for absolute sure effects opiate tolerance now i know it doesif you use it during opiate withdrawals it definitely causes the already existing insomnia and rls to be worsethank you for this yes i figured maaaayyyybe starting w 1mg  i used to use opiates pretty heavily years ago but haven‚Äôt done anything in years except a few codeine pills  i didn‚Äôt know though how much of at all my kratom tolerance would impact the dosage i should start with  anyway i‚Äôve got 3 8mg tablets i don‚Äôt have to be in any rush i can start small and still have plenty to experiment with

,,,rjstim,gum^opiates^china^opium,ever hear of snus it comes in little pouches that u tuck on the side of ur gums like dip but it doesnt require spitting and comes in sealed packets its definitely doable in a concealed manner they should sell it at most stores that sell cigs the best kinds are from sweden where it originated general is a really good one but they make american brands like camel now though not as good the other good thing is its not nearly as bad for u as regular dip anyway that would satisfy nic cravings as would something like nicorette gumyes but ur generally not gonna see those people on a forum like this which is mostly enthusiasts whove crossed that recreational line a long time ago lol i think i read before that out of every single person who takes opiates in a given year the vast majority arent addicted kinda tough to really verify thoughits certainly more profitable than real dope and if ur getting pure fent wholesale im not sure what could have a higher profit potential just for an example lets say were talking about a finger 10g of solid 50 purity heroin for 750 to make an equipotent finger of fentadope instead youd only need 200mg of fent so 02g of it so lets say u ordered a full gram of pure fent from china and got a good deal at 50 i dont know the actual prices but that sounds feasible youd be able to make 5 fingers or 50g of fentadope which would easily be worth 50g itself so just with that scenario right there pure fent can have a 50x profit potential no way ur getting anywhere near a 50x markup with real dope or any other drug i can think of what can beat that this is why dealers can sell it so  much cheaper than real dope and make loads more profit doing itthe usual way is to just score slit the pods at the opportune time and collect the opium latex after it oozes out it contains morphine codeine thebaine and lots other opiatesalkaloids they usually do this a few times to collect max opium another way is to process the entire plant stems and all called poppy straw but thats more of an industrial largescale method are u sure u have the right kind of poppy with morphine ive never tried opium like that but id love to grow it myself i live in a recently legalized state and was able to grow my own cannabis for the first time this past summer along with tomatoes ‚Äì and that was awesome id love to have my own plantation with poppy and coca thrown into the mix too though i love gardening but id love to process my own h  c as well lolyoull get a little higher thats how ive always used opiates redosing through the day instead of just doing 1 large dose all at once
,,,SteveDeQuincey,opiate^opiates^opioid,codeine isnt active is a pro drug means that it must first pass in the liver and get metabolized into morphine then it goes into the bloodstream and pass the blood brain barrier  more than 800mg of codeine is extremely dangerous to the body heroin is a different substance and definitely more powerful  when i hadnt tolerance around 250 mg of codeine gave me a nice high felling warm and stuff it can give you an idea of opiates  if youre the first times start at 120mg max dont push for example i always preferred pharmaceuticals stuff rather than street drugs heroin iv is another world like morphine iv never go there you can have nice highs from weaker stuff without using needles  if were speaking about smokingsnorting heroin codeine is definitely weaker but as i said can give you an idea of the opiate effects  this is granted but be careful even weaker opiates can trigger strong addiction i know thathope youre like my gf i wasam an oxy addict start with h and ended up with pharma stuff now im in detox but thats not the point i baked myself on oxys multiple times and my gf does the same but she never never crave opi or develop tolerance i was using daily she dont she never comes to me asking for opiates and never used more than onetwo times in a month  addiction to opiates can be subtle everyone at the start thought that we can manage but in the end 98 of ppl got hooked  i tried to detox multiple times in this 10 years of addiction i feel like im in heaven and next day straight to hell feeling hot and cold and the same time shittin in my pants with cramps craving for a dose  you tried you felt it now let it go until you can  best wishes  sim in a similar situation but slightly different i quit cold turkey oxy from 120160mg daily and im using kratom to help withdrawal im on day 11 from quitting oxy and i want to stay at 25g daily kratom  from a scientific view were both in a situation where are opioid receptors looking for a balance from cutting an x amount of a specific substance  right now its 4 days that i impose to take max 25g of kratom 4 days before i was up to 50g kratom and dxm to ease wds and i feel better everyday very slightly cause i was on another and most addictive drug but i can feel the different imho in a week max youll feel good this is not to underestimate your symptoms absolutely wds are real but dont be afraid of that it will ends very soon if you want  i hear people who doesnt suffer at all the process of cutting kratom its another substance rather than classic opioids and everyones different maybe in 3 days youll be cool  sif youre concerned about opiates only i guess youre fine but if you took dhc with acetaminophen and drink alcohol thats really bad for me it took 2 months of a high daily alcohol intake to get my Œ≥gt through the roof make a blood test  if you stick to opiates only gabap is quite harmless by itself unless you od youre fine drink shit loads of water  acetaminophen can cause serious illness and the od is sneaky you know if you had too much only 2 or 3 days later unless you know that you ingested more than 68g a day an go to er in that case within 8h from ingestion is treatable with acetylcisteine  i took opiates from 10 years never had an od im healthy except mentally speaking i suffer from depression and im a fucking addict that push everything to the limits never took 8g of apap in a day always preferred pharmaceuticals rather than streets drugs and always looked and avoided dangerous interactions  i dunno if youre still takin acetaminophen apap but if i were you ill avoid alcohol and apap like a plague  take a blood test and see your gp  this is not a medical advice im not a physician im speaking by personal experience and nursing studiesfuck yeah i also when stopped opiateskratom my sex drive is insane every opiate agonist kills testosterone  well what can i say enjoy mateinteresting aspect i read that somewhere that touches different receptors than classic opiate agonist like oxy or heroin the physical part of wd i can pass on it but man the mental part is a bitch i hate the anxiety sensation and feel dysphorichi french cousin im italian here its banned since 2016 if you took kratom recreationally not to get high only but for energy etc its ok to leave the boat but and i dont want to break any reddit rules if you take it to stay away from other hard drugs or to cope an addiction i say fuck that continue your kratom path kratom save me from a decade opiate addiction im still battling but it helps more than shitty methadone or subs  if you dunno where to buy pm me i buy online from a trusted source in eu i dont making advertising just help a mate in need if is that case i cant say where here on public i already break this rule once  best wishes  sso its like a classic opiate wd in your experience everyones different so i have interest in every opinion how much did you took stopped cold turkey or by taper luckily i dont have heath issue or pain but wd sucks eitherglad to hear that i mean the comparison to hydro not your story im sorry for that i always found that opiate wds is bearable with the right meds like clonidine and benzos for ex definitely not funny but doable the worst part is when the pain fades and the mind start shitting stupid rationalization like well im clean now i can use or my pinky hurts ima take an 80s just to be sure now im in that part  happy to hear that kratom wds arent as bad as other stuff i was taking the rls is really annoying but is an input to keep taking my kratom and taper slowly with a taper plan i guess im going to feel anything  just to know how much kratom you were taking and for how long youve been on it at the time of the story  si was 18 innocent and happy to bought 10g of black hash really good hash soft black as night outside and when broken green as a leaf inside with that weed oil smell that only hash can give  i thank my bro i put the 10g in my shorts actually between my nuts with my dick over to cover my ovulo we call that in italy ovulo is a drug eaten and pooped cleaned but still intact  i forgot to go to the bath in my bro house so i go quickly home everything fine no cops or shit i parked my bike and i though damn i need to go to the bath really quick i run on the stairs bringing to my house i enter and i jump on the toilet i start to piss first but i hear a plop i though wtf i hadnt poo already oh fuck of course it was my hash without thinking i turn back with no pants on and i put my arm in the toilet i know sounds too trainspotting but it wasnt an opioid supp unfortunately and grab at the last moment the hash  well at least i only piss on that and it was still close so if it resist the gastric acid can handle easily some piss on in  i washed my ovulo and enjoy later  happy endinglike ksmith said be careful it can really cause resp depression if you take enough kratom honestly no i didnt notice that when mix kratom and alcohol just an increase of the two  weed is always in my stash but im not a pot head anymore i like smoke bongs and joints but in the evening and not even everyday right now mary jane make me anxious sometimes but never happen with kratom alone or mixed with other things  from a scientific view kratom bonds to opiate receptors and less to nmda gaba dopamine and serotonin receptors alcohol bonds to gaba but other sub receptors than kratom  weed bonds to the cannabinoids receps so its a different story  but the rule everyone is different and react differently is always truethanks man really i made those questions mainly for curiosity but im an addict im today 2 week clean and yesterday i use now i explain why im not rationalize it  i was detox for 5th time from a decade addiction morphine oxy fentanyl heroin codeine tramadol ecc im not in pain physically so i use it to get merely high im in a period of big changes and i was going good with a little of kratom but the idea of never use opiates again even for legit pain when happens scared me to death and trigger bad cravings  yesterday i took oxys and i was like thats it im laying on bed feeling good all alone without my gf without energy to study or doing things is it worth it my final answer is no is not worth it  i need it i was in need to do that i also made a video of myself in that state to remember what i stated in this weeks i got a rush for life i enjoyed more talk to people sex was great i was more confident and finally more myself popping pills is not the answer and yesterday i get it in deep  it may sounds weird or an excuse but right now im feeling very good i dont have cravings im more confident to go straight to my goal living next week with my gf find a work while i do exams for university and then being finally a nurse yep im studying nursing  when ill be in hospital in my hands will pass every kind of drugs the drugs i used to love and i must be in control i also saved some oxys to keep rotting on my shelf it must be my decision not take drugs anymore not the lack of those  sounds really weird i know but it worked and next time ill crave that sht ill take a look at my video of that last night it was like a comrade a friend i used to see and now i want to leave you must say goodbye to him and understand deeply why  and your words encourage me more than before thanks again and thanks everyone that answer to me  sgot a clonidine patch on my body right now guess why ahah  very deep answer thank you i always thought that it cant be real getting hooked again in so short time but some ppl on forum says so and fucks me up a bit  in past after withdrawing cold turkey i used opiates after short time but wds doesnt came back but some states that got worse during time and the next withdrawal will be heavier and tolerance skyrocket in matter of days being in a fragile period all that made me think a lot and i cannot understand that from a physiological view  22 is always 4 thanks for your time  si switched from an oxy habit to kratom and my sex drive is coming back but even that im not 100 kratom touches opiate receptors even if its not a proper opioid it lowers testosterone levels like every other opiate does of course the impact is far less heavy when it comes to kratom but its there  take the least amount you can to not going into withdrawal spread more the intake during the day and your sex drive will increase a bit  im taking 25g daily when i see my gf i take less 5g is my single dose when it comes to sex i take 335g and i can have sex even more than one time a day  im a person who suffer a lot from sex disfunction when im on opiates with oxycodone i barely can have sex once a week and the orgasm was not pleasant as natural also shorter  if you already cut from 15g to 10g you must be cool but if you feel not ready try to taper more or the day you see your gf try stay off kratom until sex happens and dose after having sex  sim into kratom from a year but im still a novice so dont take for granted that im right being a decade opiates junkie i readstudy the substances i used to know how it all works also studying nursing at university helps  from what i read and i can be wrong 2 solutions cames in mind  1 youre ordering from the same vendor and same strain but being a plant the alkaloids in it can vary for example if you buy always red borneo strain one batch can differ from another and i guess that all the kratom a seller has doesnt came from the same plant also i read that older kratom is more powerful than a younger one  or  2 less is more some ppl with tolerance used to take 10g the dosage are merely an example finds that lowering the dose lets say 5g its  more effective and euphoric rather than dosing full i dont get this either but everyones different   from what i experienced got cold turkey from 160mg oxycodone daily took 50g of kratom the first days after a week i wanted to be stable at the dosage of max 30g to start taper lately the following days i kept a journal to keep track of my daily intake and most of the times i ended up taking less than 25g daily a dose that a week before used at once and im feeling good this morning its 8 days that im sticking to this schedule and early awake i took 8g split in 2 doses result  i feel warm and slightly high  theres no definite answer from my experience cause pharmacologically speaking i dont know wtf is going on but its real  i used to have a godzilla tolerance before detox a year ago i was using 6mg or even 10mg 10000ug of fentanyl at once to get slightly high on top of 100mgs of methadone madness  everytime i relapse on oxys even after a few months period my tolerance skyrocket in couple of weeks force me to pop an handful of pills 20s or 40s   with kratom its all different and definitely save my life theres few scientific articles and most are controversy we as species need to study better this plant and theres no definitive answer from what i know   sorry if my comment gave you more questions than answers   skratom replace my strong painkiller addiction thus plant saved my life i went through withdrawal cold turkey from 160mgs of oxys and a year ago it helps me to cope a cold turkey from 700mgs to zero  now im 12days clean thanks to kratom im taking reasonable dosage 25g daily and ill taper slowly over time  i feel better it gave me the strength to do things during the withdrawal  the red veins strains have an opiatelike effect but itself kratom is not an opiate its not a drug to concern like the media can say its not addictive like painkillershit but a great substance to help in everyday life like caffeine  im glad to this forum people who answer to my doubt and help me during the worst part of detox  i have a friend who isnt an addict like me and he enjoy kratom once in a while to chill in the evening  i smoke marijuana since i was 15 im 29 and its not the same thing marijuana can trigger anxiety or panic attacks along with a bit of addiction we have super potent weed in this times shit with more than 25 thc insane kratom doesnt of course you can get addicted if you have a personality like mine damn i got addicted even on vitamin c but for a guy who wants a chill evening is great  also most people use more energyzing strains to work out in gym  its a very wide spectrum substance can helps in multiple waysopiates in general lower testosterone im detox from stronger opi like oxy and heroin and when i was on it most of the time oxys at least couple of years my sex drive got crash  kratom stimulates Œº and Œ¥ opiates receptors with a lower binding affinity than oxymorphine but still im 11 days clean and i feel i was back at my adolescent times orgasms are much stronger and i have the desire to have sex at least 2x a day my girlfriend thanks i got testosterones rushes like being aggressive like a dumb macho with people who annoy me not my personality im a very reasonable person usually   i experienced this kind of stuff everytime i detox with time everything go back to normal kratom isnt an opiate but acts like so therefore its normal to have a lower sex drive while on it  try to cut the dosage or decrease the times per week once a week maybe its ok but try to rotate strains to avoid tolerance  before my opiate tolerance skyrocket and proper addiction came in i was using heroin 1 times every 2 week and i wasnt withdrawing  kratom is obviously different and far less addictive than h or pharmashit so if you take it like once every 10 days imo youre cool  sthanks mate i was almost freak out thinking about another withdrawal i stopped cold turkey from 700mgs oxys to zero last summer with comfort meds i made it but i relapse 2 months later knowing the drill i tried to stay lower than before 100160mg daily  im on day 10 of wds right now its the 3rd day that i take 2225g of kratom and the symptoms are very mild   i was scared caming off kratom but reading you guys im very confident to taper and look normal unlike when trying to taper methadone or oxys where i was covered in sweat dysohoric and anxious to begin with  every time i detox i buy clonidine benzo zolpidem lyrica dxm and kratom this time is mildmoderate wds but today i feel better i can stay under 25g of kratom daily and the taper schedule and support that you gave me speaking to all you guys of rkratom made me go berserk and blow this fucing addiction away  thanks everyone ill keep update in another thread opiate withdrawal and kratom  peace  s
,,,SorrowFloats91,black,people also constantly talk about how good people on ebt eat how they buy expensive food how they get whatever they want when the hardworking americans pay for it with their taxes  so i definitely think theres a subtle racism to this behind the obvious racism like  white people abuse the system so they can get delicious food thats out of reach for most people black people abuse the system to buy drugs or by selling the card for money its like the sin of the white folks is using a card to get expensive food for a sophisticated palate minorities just want drugs   its stupid but whenever theres a case about misused benefits they seem to tweak that narrative based on the race of the recipient

star person whatever people choose to call it   im not lying or pulling your leg when i tell you i have a different physiological system than you do i usually get this temporal ignorance all the time with unspiritual humans they never even think to the possibility of intelligent creatures all around them theres plenty of star people everywhere when people find this out about me theyre either in denial like you or theyre actually open id hoped that people who use drugs are higher aware of us than the close minded fucks walking around everyday   guess you stepped on the minefield with me hoping youd find a fellow human when im not even 1 percent human   my profile pic thats my art im a highly talented artist and that picture is what i really look like underneath the bioengineered human looking skin and no dont argue about it with me because its futile if you do im an electromagnus im the only one here at the moment now you can either be kind to me anyways despite my species difference or youre not worthy of my friendship if you cant accept me ive been hurt really bad in my life and time here on earth and i will cut anybody i think is going to be another harmful person in my life   and no im not psychotic either my mental health is good just have ptsd from a bad childhood   you should be more open to the differences in people not all are what you see or even think if you cant accept it please leave because ive already been hurt enough   my kind can become opiate users as well any creature with opioid receptors can become addicted but it depends on the persons choices and wether or not they can control themselves yes i have vulnerabilities just like you some are different of course im not immune to being sick physically or an addiction to something im just a different kind of living creature thats allbut my body works way different than most i have more opioid receptors than others and i can get loopy off buprenorphine and fentanyl together i used to be

,,,White_smoke2,opioid^opium^opiates,thank you for understanding not many do and ive tried gabapentin up to 3g with no effect lyrica i took 600mg and it worked well   i have the same issue that kurt cobain had a slight curve in the spine that doctors still to this day debate that caused his extreme abdominal pain   ive had my gallbladder removed appendix removed i now have chronic pancreatitis and the back problem and i keep getting told im not hurting then why do i hurt  and i also have an endorphin deficiency because when my mom was pregnant with me 20 years ago they didnt have the scientific knowledge today and back then when a woman was going into labor before 9 months they used morphine which is easily carried to the bbb of the infant in the womb and she told me she cant even count the amount of times doctors gave her morphine because of me like 30 to 50 times or more  recent studies have shown that can cause an endorphin deficiency causing severe depression and severe pain for no reason unless the opioid receptors are filled with something   most studies have used low dose buprenorphine for that issue and it worked well as morphine but buprenorphine has a longer half life ive heard in some countries opioids and buprenorphine can be prescribed for depression i just wish america would fix its damn medical system im 20 with 30000 dollars of medical bills easily because of my illnessesi have chronic pancreatitis and fucked up nerves in my back my back has a type of curve that causes extreme pain tho i love the europhia from opiates i usually use opium up to 5gs so however much morphine codeine etc ive had fent but it made me extremely sick in the hospital so they put me back on dilaudid  oxy is the only pill that helps pain as you know opium is not a pill ive tried morphine codeine opium oxy hydrocodone buprenorphine fentanyl demerol tramadol and imodium   tramadol was jack shit gay imodium at 44mg did more then 300mg tramadol   when im not chasing the high i can take 20mg or so of oxy or 50mg of hydrocodone for a very nice relief of pain but when i want to get loaded and not feel anything i can use 50 to 60mg oxy probably 200mg hydrocodone but that shit expensive asf and all the tylenol but the morphine i can easily handle 500mg at a time in the opium ive probably done almost a full gram of morphine before and i have never been so high even compared to the shots in the hospital iv of course   but ive also used kratom found great pain relief in it i worked my way up to 32grams at once 5 to 6 times a day and still made a kilo last almost 4 months with 2 people using it and 2 people who stole at least 100grams out of the kilo ive heard kratom is just like methadone so i figured maybe thats what i should try  but i only fear going to the mmc and being looked at like an addict but i guess i have no choice if i really need pain relief but i have read buprenorphine is the first go to but it doesnt work on me so would they write me methadone if i tested extremely positive for opiates or just subsi know it shitty people but im glad i did that pill and not my brother who has no opioid tolerance like codeine will get him lit up if it had my breathing fucked like that he would have diedthats what i thought but i loved the fentanyl cut coke my friend gave me the most out of his bag because they couldnt handle the nasuea that fentanyl causes but yeah shit was crazy i imagine its like a speedball when smoked crazy europhia without nodding for 10 minutes then it was holy hell im nodding and no one could tell but the legs were about 90 minutes the only opioid ive had with those legs was fent in the hospital   we only had 2 bags like that and most of both ended up my nose but when 3 people are nodding on coke it isnt cokei just thought people would like to see them because they go great with opiatesholy shit i cant go to pain clinics because i smoke weed and because of thc theyre like your an abuser no im a sufferer there is a difference i hate living in pain but dont want to use heroin but have thought about it because everyone says its the most euphoric and pain reliever opioid but damn having to go to a methadone clinic every day i dont have a job or car yet because of my chronic conditions but if i had an effective pain medication i could work 80 hours a week or more i love working i hate suffering in pain and thanks to the usa thinking theres an opioid epidemic and chronic pain sufferer shouldnt be able to take daily pain meds im definitely going to think about it theres a clinic about 27 miles away but after 12 years of chronic pain im tried and ready to die unless someone takes care of the pain

,,,BeyondPsycho69,black^opiate^opiates,it builds fast and drops fast too so like you can take 4mg  6mg whatever like everyday you‚Äôll black out sometimes or most times in my experience then you go through some really bad withdrawals and 1mg can hit hard maybe that‚Äôs just my experience but also what my friends say as well   also it is extremely addictive and can lead to bad things i‚Äôm personally trying very hard to get myself off them but it‚Äôs so hardi tried it once i fell in love but had to pull away somethings are too good to be true and hearing from people in active addiction to recovery that‚Äôs seems like the case i‚Äôm an opiate pill addict it‚Äôs expensive but manageable but the thought of heroin again is always there so i dont know your gonna get mixed reviews nobody will stop you and nobody should force youi have a high tolerance to benzodiazepines i use to mix them a lot and with opiates and alcohol now i mainly use them for the minor withdrawal symptoms i get between doses of opiates and i try to only use them when my anxiety level is pretty much unbearable i always keep some xanax and kpins if i smoke weed which is very occasional drink or go on opiate binges they make life much easier that‚Äôs for sure   my favorite thing to do is purposely not eat before taking any opiate making them hit harder and stronger then keep a xanax for when the come down starts from extended opiate use   tramadol is a weird drug but it did the trick with helping my pain and even gave me a nice high except it does give me extreme dry mouth and nausea   i guess my biggest problem isn‚Äôt a super high opiate tolerance it‚Äôs that i‚Äôm not effected by certain pain meds and very susceptible to benzodiazepines and ssri‚Äôs i‚Äôm just hoping i can find a nice opiate that works for me consistently without having to turn to heroin i am willing to try diluadid again does anyone have suggestions on the most effective way to get the best high from them   also does anyone have suggestions on how to take ocycontin that have the xr wax on them   i am always looking for the most effective way to dose on any opiates i can get so i appreciate all the tips and tricks everyone has to offer and i am happy to share my experience and knowledge being able to tell my story and hear others is quite nicei have tried diluaded a few times but it has yet to work on me i honestly have no idea why i‚Äôve been around people that take 8mg and start nodding out and i don‚Äôt even feel a buzz after taking 16mg even morphine i have to take at least 60 mg to even feel something but i can take 2040 mg hydrocodone or oxycodone and get a decent high   i am a natural redhead and have read about certain medication especially pain meds that i need much more of to feel the same to what everyone else feels i know i need extra anesthesia if i go under for surgery and double what normal people need at the dentist for novocain   i guess i just want to find something that works for me it can be really frustrating when you‚Äôre with some friends that take opiates and you take twice as much and still don‚Äôt feel anything   i don‚Äôt want to do heroin but it would be nice to have something that actually gets me high
,,,Explorer427,opiates,if you are mainly trying to feel the effects of codeine but  you also wanna throw benzos into the mix then does moderately on codeine like you would and slowly mix in the benzos until u feel right with a high tolerance to benzos i would still go slow on it codeine alone is good at moderat doses but for some people they also would add a mix of benzos i find that it diminishes the opiates ever so slightly every ones got a different reaction to these combos enjoy yourself man stay safewhat about combinging opiates with other opiates does it potentiate it does it overlap one another and what was your favorite only opiates combo
,,,contemplatethefall,opiate,i went through the same exact thing after my first and only relapse i started out after getting clean from heroin to doing op 80s   for the first few weeks or even a monthmonth and a half i didn‚Äôt experience physical withdrawals but i experienced mental ones i would wake up and feel sad and depressed without them and immediately run to my dealer to get more op 80s to feel happy   of course this eventually got to the point where i was experiencing physical withdrawals without them and led me back into a fullblown heroin addiction that was far worse than the one i had previously gotten clean from and for full disclosure i had actually stayed clean for upwards of six months or more without turning to the op 80s i wasn‚Äôt unhappy or experiencing paws i just had a little extra money and foolishly thought that i could dabble without getting back into a bad situation   my biggest recommendation is to exercise go to the gym blast music enjoy yourself as much as possible be around safe supportive loving friends and family if possible talk to people if you have insurance or can afford going to see an addictions therapist i highly recommend that but otherwise a healthy diet an exercise regimen and a structured daily life with limited downtime really does help ease that opiate sadness i really credit those things as the reason i didn‚Äôt experience any paws after getting clean  if you have any questions feel free to ask and i wish you the best of luck‚ù§Ô∏èthank u so much for the info i‚Äôm all the way in pa on the east coast or i would totally hit u up for recommendationsüòä   i‚Äôve never heard of house detoxes i‚Äôm only looking into hospital detoxes my main concern is the level of care that different facilities provide if that makes sense for example i‚Äôve heard horror stories about facilities that are totally understaffed as far as residential doctors go that as a result leaves some patients without proper medication doses  things of the like   i‚Äôm also curious to see if anyone out there has been to a detox center that provides things like iv fluids for severely dehydrated patients as well as centers that tailor a medication regimen to a patient‚Äôs specific needs for example tailoring medication for a patient that is experiencing high blood pressure  the symptoms that come with it to help combat said symptoms as opposed to centers that do a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù treatment ie subutex for opiate patients pregab for benzo patients etc
,,,purpletypepersons,opioid,the best source of information would be the american kratom association they have been working on creating a system that ensures good quality control the brands that have met standard are listed on the website and the price can vary by brand its not expensive compared to prescription medication   its available at smoke shops but id stick with a certified pure brand i did try two smoke shop brands and they both worked well so that was good  in georgia its legal theres something called the kratom protection act that gives georgia and a few other states more structured protections in law and quality regulations   as far as pain doctors go currently thats a real mixed bag some of them understand how helpful it is not just to reduce cravings for heroin but also to treat severe pain other doctors think it is like heroin and im not sure why   my experience has been very positive when i take kratom i can sit and work with my computer and not be distracted by my back pain i can sit on the floor and watch a movie i cant  do that without it   from what ive read some people with very severe pain are able to get out of the bed and do basic things or even continue working when they take it the benefits of helping those with opioid dependency are well documented but not something im personally familiar with  with the population advancing in age and poor healtcare we really need it it just drives me crazy that its available and could help so many people but very few know about it theres a lot of misinformation muddling things as well

,,,drbea,opiates^opiate,yep people are just haters personally kratom has helped me a lot still gives me a pretty good buzz and for the most part keeps me off h i still have some binges here and there and even after the binges i feel the kratom so dont knock it cause it doesnt work for you isnt worth the search maybe for you but its helped a lot of people so saying it isnt worth it is just ignorant tbh id way rather be on kratom as my management drug over subs or methadone any day oh well jokes on you i can get a kilo and last me a month or two its brought up in this sub because for a lot of ppl its a legit way to get off opiates or stay off them or just using it recreationally a very affordable way at thatdont take kratom expecting to feel the same exact effects as a real opiate like oxyyou might feel somewhat similar effects but itll never be the exact same but it might he somewhat close so dont just go taking huge amounts to feel more of an effect you need to experiment to find your own personal dosesmh no not only for wdi take it every day and still get a decent high from it but its a different kind of high reminiscent of a lowmid opiate dose mixed with some upper pep but still its own thingyesi did h for 3 years and getting off with kratom was a breeze and after a few days when my body got used to the kratom it would still get me pretty buzzed if it took enough and i was doing up to 35 per shot multiple times a day so yes even after years of abuse it still worked great for me and gave a decent high you have to experiment to find your own personal dose and give it a few days if youre coming off of real opiates idk if this is true but i feel like the real opiates have to get kicked off the receptors first before youre able to feel much which might be why it takes a few days for effectkratom for sure ppl say hurr if you have a tolerance you wont feel much which is a load of shit it depends on the person ofc but for me i used h heavy for 3 years made the switch to kratom gave me a decent buzz then and still does now it wont feel exactly like a real opiate but its fairly reminiscent you just have to experiment and find out what dose and strains work for you just buy from an online vendor not locally might take a few days for you to feel much though especially coming off of a habityeah youre right everyones different but i feel like if ppl actually gave it a chance they would like it not just taking a dose or two and being like it does nothingmore like a few days at least especially if youre coming off opiates those receptors need a bit to clear up for the kratom to bind better i just personally feel its much better to be on a semi opioid like kratom over a full one like other maintenance drugs plus the fact it gets me pretty high still but im not knocking whatever works for peopleeh not neccesarily it depends on the person etc but for me i think it helps with anxietybeing happywork etc like ill still get decent euphoria from it just nowhere near a real opiateprobably wont feel nothing wrong i used for years and it still gives me a pretty good buzz and is great for cravings etc dont be expecting a crazy full opiate high cause thats not what youre gonna get people push it on addicts for a reason its not exactly suboxone or methadone but imo far superior

know how to fully use it but is there a way to follow you or become friends with you like on fbwow i wish opiates like those made me feel good consider yourself lucky and quit while your ahead they are fun but once you start messing around with stronger ones hopefully you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs both god and the devil whispering things in both earsi suffer from moderate compression fractures in my vertebrae some are healed one is not healing in my mid back this has exposed me to opiates on a whole  other level i‚Äôm no longer seeking any type of high other than the feeling of pain relief i started when i was younger with abuse but now rely on them to treat my paini‚Äôve gotten the same thing almost like intense rage opiates put me in a space where i am reveling in the blissful solitude that is the nod if some stimulus disrupts that zone they put me in i immediatly react with anger does this sound similar it‚Äôs like being repeatedly awakened out of extremely comfortable restful and sound sleep l very similar feeling at least in my experience ask me any questions you want i‚Äôm no expert and many on here understand the  pharmacology of opiatesdrugs in general far better than me i do have plenty of first hand experience with nearly every prescription opiate in existencei‚Äôve taken it and noticed it is wonderful for depression  tramadol doesn‚Äôt act as an ssri but instead works more on norepinephrine as is therefore called an snri i think it‚Äôs effective for me personally and treats my depression well unfortunately it‚Äôs my opinion that all other true opiates make my depression worse in the long runit‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs just that opiates aren‚Äôt viewed by the fda as a treatment for depression it‚Äôs counterproductive to prescribe an opiate for depression as they naturally deplete you of happy chemicals in your brain   drugs like ssri‚Äôs increase the reuptake of serotonin and therefore appear to be a better option long term i can‚Äôt deny the powerful anti depressive effects that drugs like hydrocodone oxycodone and buprenorphine especially possess they make you feel wonderful and once those effects come on life doesn‚Äôt have the same negative outlook as it did i believe that opiates cause depression if anything they temporarily give you a high that makes the user feel extremely content and the ability to shut off and ignore things that were bothering me is a constant effect  tramadol and suboxone aren‚Äôt true opiates but have a wide array of strange anti depressant properties even the slightest amount of suboxone gives me a different mindset and the depressive thoughts literally melt away from the all day type relief sub provides  me personally i don‚Äôt think opiates will ever get the chance to treat depression they are here for pain and people like myself who have chronic pain issues struggle to get them can you imagine how difficult it would be for someone to have them prescribed for depression a disease you can‚Äôt take an xray for and see the fracture also opiates are known for numbing thoughtspain both emotional and physical and don‚Äôt really allow the user to tackle any sort of internal issues going on my point is they provide an escape instead of any real effects that treat the issue of chemical imbalance in the brain the cause of clinical depression i would recommend a depressed individual not take an opiate as the doors for addiction rash decision making and ‚Äútaking too much of a good thing‚Äù swing wide open when you have a depressed person taking opiateshow do you get this prescribed to you can i ask what condition you have that warrants this i only ask because i am in such a struggle getting opiates prescribed to me for compression fractures and am curious what it takes to  receive this level of opiatenessi am also on 50000 ius of vitamind a week to increase my levels of it no clue if vitamin d could have anything to do with my vertebrae fracturing so easily i legitimately feel like i can‚Äôt function at least right now without an opiate and doctors can‚Äôt comprehend that it is completely normal to not want to sit around all day in painwhat drove you away from pm  i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the state i‚Äôm livi in but it is literally impossible to get prescribed opiates beyond hydrocodne and like i said my pain meds aren‚Äôt even touching these fracturesit‚Äôs literally impossible to be younger than 30 and not seen as a drug seeking pill head if you have a conversation about opiates treating your pain with a doctor they don‚Äôt help you they just want to accuse you of things and make the process as difficult as it can be i currently get 60 5mg norco for moderate compression fractures in my vertebrae and it does fuck all i hate this shit

,,,RawlingRR,opiate^opiates^opioid,because youre new to the substance its sudden raise of mental dependance once you start something new because of how much it helps it will slowely go away and even if you do get a real mental dependence after awhile it will go away and you will learn to go without it as long as youre perscribed you should be good because you alwase have it and dexamp vyvanseadderall is the safest idk abt safest maybe most lenient  scheduled drug you could withdrawal from in my opinion it seemed hard st first but after withdrawaling from oxycodone its a piece of cake now you are just tired and really hungry and sometimes have minor depressive symptoms but thats nothing compared to a opiate or benzo withdrawal tolerance doesnt raise quick on amphetamines either ive been on the same dose for 15 years and pretty much get the same affects except a bit less motivationtramadol is an opiate that can have stimulant like affects on norepinephrine and whatnot at high doses my friend had a seizure from taking a lotand went to the hospital he survived and was healthy and fine the same night ive also heard about it being dangerous at high doses and that just confirmed it for me but idk people get seizures for so many different reasons the same night my friend had a seizure  he took 10000 mg of gabapentin  which is an anti seizure med and is almost impossible to od on which honestly probably reduced how severe the seizure was and goes to show how strong the tramadol isplacebo most likely i dont think its enough to affect you much at all and the peptides might not even agonize mu kappa or any opioid receptor most likely your bodys way of saying you need gluten  i would go to the doc with opiates even in a lower dose of oxy 510 mg you will get decently warm on the inside like cuddly and euphoric with a head buzz and relaxed yet motivated im not gonna diagnose you or anything but i would get everything set with a doctor and try not to think about it much and just do what feels rightdextromethorphan dxm d3methoxynmethyl morphinan is the dextro isomer of levomethorphan a semisynthetic morphine derivative  deadiversion related but doesnt act on the mu opioid receptor   thank you i appreciate the civil conversationtheyre related i said its not an opiate but related to one snorting muscle relaxers like cyclobenzaprine isnt great obviously but zanaflex is great yes ik its not xanax lmao it acts sorta like a benzo in a way and gives you full body relaxation even while wd   im perscribed adderall for adhd and take it everyday for awhile now i appreciate the concern   yes i know thats why i said do not take unless doctor says its ok i think i did atleast but i take zoloft with adderall which has a higher reuptake inhibit affinity for serotonin than st johns wort and im fine doesnt mean everyone will be but the main concern is serotonin syndrome but its not a huge deal imoi would just go to the doc ask for a blood test tell them what happens after you eat glutenbread but dont mention the opioid stuff the blood test and other tests will most likely give the answerplacebo happens most of the time without realising by accident im not sayimg this is forsure pleacebo but just you going out of your way to ask about it makes you think more about it and you are saying that you are more sleepy etc etc nothing wrong with ithell i wish i could do that   carbs the type of carb and carbs in general may give certain affects like that especially since they are rapidly absorbed and used for energy   i dont reccomend trying oxy or anything but if u do then you will see a huge difference obviously ill do some research because this is very interesting and i appreciate you asking the question im just having a hard time even if studies show its true believeing breadgluten has opiate peptides strong enough to feel   one thing i think it could be if you have celiac disease  allergy that interferes or may interfere with gluten is just the way its interacting with your gut the reaction mixed with the use of carbs may cause a raise in body temperature which opioids do the same thats the warm cuddly feeling but its specifically internal temp and you get tired and fall asleep you might wake up in cold sweats due to your intestines and body having a hard time processing the glutentaking atleast 2 days often or a week sometimes off will help with the magic it will blunt though no matter what and the reason you feel the magic is because thats the opiate magic starting opiates for a good 4 months youll have motivation and a sort of energy but still having depressed cns  etc its because of dopamine release you still get dopamine release from adderall even if its lower than normal that mixed with the high dopamine release from oxy or opiates in general just bump the euphoria a notch higher for me though im not wasteing 15 mg oxy on adderall if i want full opiate affects ot full adderall effects i take them spread out  seperate stay safe brotha
,,,StickOfGlue112,opiates,sounds like you overdosed the percs by just a bit normally when mixing cocaine and opiates the depressant effects of the opiates are counteracted by the stimulant effects of the cocaine however uppers tend to wear off quicker than downers and as it does your body gradually slows down to a stop as it was only kept alive by the coke  sounds like you have a definite problem that almost cost you youre life mate might be time to step up the recovery game
,,,Shaundogg83,opiate,no clinic is going to treat you with methadone for kratom addiction this is a terrible idea and would be dangerous as well the smallest dose of methadone can be fatal to a non opiate tolerant person while you may think you have a tolerance to opiates because of your kratom use its no where near enough to take methadone try tapering using loperamide dxm in small doses cbd or weed and otc painkillers like tylenol and motrin loperamide is an opiate that binds to opiate receptors in the gut its very helpful for mild withdrawals dxm in small doses can also help with mild withdrawals you can beat this it wont even be as bad as withdrawals from hydrocodone or tramadol
,,,vv0id,opiate^chocolate,methadone is a sinthetic opiate thats very pure not like heroin it harms so much as any other opiate specially the liver his most damaged organ   i didnt get to know him but i know that he was a great person married and with a son and a daughter who cried very much for him as his brother my friend loves all of his siblings but he was his favourite brother he told me that he was really strong and that he never saw him ill not even a cold  i felt so much this loss and i felt very guilty for being consuming heroin and for going to start to use methadone soon   he will be always rememberednah its not overdose what im worried about its just getting too high so everybody realices it forgetting my things at the train i already forgot a bag being sober at the station someone just told me getting distracted so i dont realice its my stop i think mine is the last one or losing the strength to take my luggage out the train its only taking it down and crossing the trains door honestly and people  already helped me to put it up so   lol youre right it probably wont happen anything bad and already an hour has passed and im not caring very much ill just start picking up my things some time before arriving as i did on the previous train thanks man im going back to drink my chocolate milk 
,,,idontlikeposting03,opiate^opiates,get some gabapentin kratom is also an opiate and will help u but when u stop taking it u will still have withdrawals the goal is to help the opiate withdrawals without taking opiates to help it gabapentin isnt an opiate so it will help u with the symptoms while ur brain heals in the area weed does help aswell but be cautious as it can make people paranoid and anxious if you can get your hands on gabapentin and clonidine u should be alright as far as the paws symptoms go like energy and sleepexercise is the best thing for it that and timeremember time heals all good luck im 3 weeks off suboxone and im finally getting some energy its been a real drag these few weeksso you tapered the best way possible i jumped from 2 mg about 15 days ago and wellit was not as bad as i thought but i definetly agree with the post above stating to get gabapentin it is a miracle drug for opiate withdrawals it made the whole process too easy for me personally the lack of energy and diarrhea is still lingering for me but its getting better i am on 1200mg of gabapentin daily and just a fyi u can get addicted to gabapentin and it has its own bad withdrawals but to me its doing more good then bad right now and i do plan to taper off the gaba soon once my mind is fully healed from the opiate abuse dont be scared subs are more mental then physical but u will feel some wds if you need anything im here for u good luck its the best decision i ever madewhy would u do that to yourself after being sober 9 months i had back surgery so i know how back pain is i still have 2 herniated discs and sciatica running down my right leg its bad but u getting on an opiate will just mask the pain cause ull b high and eventually ull have a habit and pain dont do it im only 3 weeks clean but no amount of pain is going to make me go back to being a slave i would goto a chiropractor if i was you a good one can do you wonders good luck i hope u do the next right thingi hope you meant 01 mg and not a full mg of clonidine it helps alot with the hot flashes and anxiety but it makes u rly lazy and tired and when ur coming off opiates thats already a main issue to it does enhance that symptomyeah ive had horrible wds from kratom people see it as harmless but it most certainly isnt that the wds r just diff then ur traditional opiatei owe me gettin off suboxone to gabapentin and my support system like someone said at doses 1200mg and higher it will help with the rls and mood issues it will help u sleep and even help control ur body temperature it should be given to everyone coming off opiateskeep it up i am mad that i slipped up and did that 3g of kratom after being off suboxone  which i think is one of the hardest opiates to kick for 3 weeks but idt i set myself back too much so happy for u thoughim almost on 3 weeks of being off suboxone and all opiates as i write this to you i am past the acute withdrawals but have paws symptoms such as lethargy fatigue  some depression and a bit of a hard time sleeping its funny cause i finally get past the initial harsh sickness and started to get my appetite back and now i have a stomach virus didnt get even a simple cough for 7 years of shooting dope but 3 weeks off opiates and my body is being normal by getting sick once in a while go figure i dont believe u have cancer god forbid but if u rly want to get it checked out by all means go for it what u describes though seem like regular withdrawals

,,,cruxtone,opioid,thanks for your response the vocal suboxone users seem to generally agree that its a nasty medication and if effective should be used for the minimum amount of time  the reason i cant just quickly taper to a stop and attempt sobriety without an aide is because ive tried that multiple times there is nothing that has kept me from relapsing eventually i hope you find lasting sobriety but if i were in your shoes i would eventually continue my addiction and the things involved with it secrecy money morning withdrawals other substances etc  suboxone has given me stability inspite of its side effects however it has not eliminated cravings or treated my anxietydepression like traditional opioids did im hoping i can learn coping mechanisms for the cravings and treat my underlying anxietydepression while the suboxone keeps me stable  if suboxone is partially satiating my opioid receptors to keep me from continuing the patterns of substsnce abuse then it seems it has its value i want someone to say that they discovered they were able to partially heal and then established a better baseline for working toward full sobriety at the end of suboxone treatment to be at a better starting point then when going straight to sobriety without a suboxone transition   i dont feel intense dullness or suicidal thoughts from the medication i dont feel good either i feel my old negative sober feelings but at like 50 the 50 is giving me enough stamina to continue resisting the patterns of substance abuse it still feels like work but i might be headed toward a better final outcome  are you equipped now to stay sober for the rest of your life please update the community with your progress and good luck again thank you for your response

,,,TheDisobedience333,black^opiates,kratom is illegal in my state i have no experience with the black or grey market so i wouldn‚Äôt be sure how to get some  plus i‚Äôve read that kratom will only prolong withdrawals i‚Äôve also read the opposite though so i have no idea what to believe this is why i made this post there is so much conflicting information out therei am on day 4 of withdrawals for some reason i feel worse today than yesterday i‚Äôve been in discomfort and pain for 4 days and i‚Äôm desperate for relief   my habit was around the equivalent of 4050 mg of hydrocodone though i took all kinds of different pills when i was actively using then i got on suboxone for a month and managed to taper down to 5 mg suboxone was ruining my life causing me depression anhedonia and suicidal thoughts so i jumped off that onto extended release morphine i rapidly tapered down to 15 mg of morphine and my last dose was last wednesday   i honestly thought withdrawals would be getting significantly better by now based on my experience quitting in the past i have work and appointments to go to starting tomorrow and i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôm going to do it the restlessness and the leg and back pain are terrible but what really getting to me is the sweats i‚Äôm either far too hot or shivering from cold  there is no inbetween i‚Äôve sweated through 3 pairs of sheets and 2 comforters in three days wearing clothing makes me too hot but taking it off immediately sends goosebumps and shivers shooting through my entire body  i know just one 30 mg codeine pill would make everything so much better at this point but i‚Äôve come this far without taking anything yet still it‚Äôs calling to me screaming to me at times i can‚Äôt figure out whether making things better for me now will make it that much worse tomorrow i only have 2 30 mg codeines left plus a couple of 50 mg tramadols so i wouldn‚Äôt be able to totally relapse on what i have and i no longer have any access to any other opiates i just want this to be over  edit apologies for the essay withdrawals make me desperate to talk and talk and talkthank you for sharing your experience so my issue is that i need to be functioning and back to work and such by tuesday but preferably monday that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very important i don‚Äôt take anything to prolong the worst withdrawal symptoms i have managed to quit opiates a couple times before and my withdrawals only lasted about 3 days   i have actually had no problems with diarrhea or nausea this whole time which makes me think my withdrawal must be much less intense than it could have been and gives me hope that it will end soon perhaps tapering down with the suboxone is what did the trick so instead of withdrawing from a 50 mg or so hydrodcodone habit hopefully i‚Äôm withdrawing from the 5 mg suboxone instead   it‚Äôs really just the pain all over the constant discomfort and the restless legs that are getting to me and making me crave pills but even if imodium will help that now i don‚Äôt want to take it if it‚Äôs going to prolong these symptoms to any extent

,,,Seakawn,dreams^black,reality checks are merely statistical probabilities for becoming lucid in dreams not guarantees  you flip light switches in real life making a habit of doing it all the time even better if its exaggeratedie every time you flip a light switch you do it a few times in a row  therefore when youre dreaming youre more likely to be in a situation where you flip a light switch heres where the statistical probability comes into play it wont work every time but its not supposed to the goal is to have it happen enough that eventually you flip a switch in your dream and then the light ultimately acts funny eg you turn it off but the light only goes dim instead of dark or you turn it on and the light is only dim instead of bright  and even then you arent guaranteed to become lucid but you do it because theres a decent chance you will eg hmm this light is weird holy shit im literally dreaming right now  lucid dreaming is a skill and the more you practice techniques to initiate lucidity the more you increase the potential that youll become lucid  and thats also why you want to practice as many reality checks as you can to increase your chances from as many angles as possible if youre dreaming and not in a scenario with light switches obviously that reality check wont be applicable and thus youd have to hope for a chance for another reality check that is accessible counting fingers looking twice at a clock etcby this logic literally near everything you do supports war inequality or general injustice  so way to goyour philosophy actively frames all human beings as pieces of shit just for the mere crime of living and participating in societythe economy just in general you think you arent supporting bad shit when you put gas in your car or buy food from your marketplace somewhere along the chain you are its a grim reality that we all face  also the moral burden here isnt on people buying weed from the black market its on the government for illegalizing drugs and therefore creating a black market in the first place if you dont buy the weed from your friend joe someone else will so the wheel turns whether you engage with it or not youre essentially advocating a boycott on the black market for a moral superiority without realizing that boycotts are theoretically ineffective  ignoring issues is just as bad what are you doing personally to stop the war on drugs check for blood on your own hands if youre not doing shitfor me it was traumatic because of how anxious i was if i didnt find my class on time i dreaded the thought of catching up on missed work walking in late and it being awkward potentially going to the wrong class etc  and it became real because it actually happened to where i didnt find a class in time so that just formed into a recurring anxiety that creeps back up in my dreams  at least thats my best guessyes thats a less successful reality check but its definitely viable  my friend kept a totam in his pocket for two weeks after seeing inception because he got interested in lucid dreams due to the movie and our following conversations about lucid dreaming  he had a lucid dream after that time due to the totem he dreamed that he had it in his pocket and he messed with it and it didnt act physically normal so he became momentarily lucid after recognizing the abnormality was because he was actually dreaming
,,,WesleySnape,black,before going to china i‚Äôve heard of the chinese cock being small and i‚Äôm sure everyone has at some point i wasn‚Äôt really on the habits of sword fights so i could care less if they had a small chapstick for a dick but as soon as i got there something i wasn‚Äôt ready for happened something that really blew my mind at first got me curious and then finally started getting me angry   chinese were curious to want to see what a black cock looks like in real life gay and straight male and female old and young everyone literally wanted to have a peak at it that curiosity had no boundaries no shame and not even a peak to be honest   some of the things that have happened to me in china regarding my cock are just too fucking weird to even post here i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll have to post this in multiple communities before it gets a pass for posting or else it will just be a hidden story from all   anyways starts in my first week in china i‚Äôve been to beijing before but now i was there for an indefinite amount of time i was staying with a friend but i‚Äôd have to find an apartment anytime soon i‚Äôve heard that it could be tough to get an apartment therethis is another post by itself btw   on this particular day my friend takes me to this bar around an area called santorum which is a shopping area mostly beijing night life for me is a bit dull and other cities like shanghai and guangzhou have a more appeasing night life than beijing‚Äôs   for some reason chinese like to drink their beer warm i hate that and it gets your belly bloated other alcohol you have to drink at your own risk as most liquor is fakebootlegged unless you drink chinese wine that‚Äôs a bit disgusting you know counterfeit is a big problem when you start smoking marlboro‚Äôs coming from north koreanot shitting you   another thing i hate about warm beer is that it makes you want to peeat least for me it dies that so after the second beer i went to go pee the yolo okey was where they had like 45 stalls and i chose to take the middle one as all of them were empty thats when the weirdest shit happens i don‚Äôt know where they came from but all of a sudden all the stalls were occupied i said normal and didn‚Äôt give it much thought continues doing my thing but then i kind of sensed someone behind me and then i turned around ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a fucking dude trying to look at my penis from behind me then i also notice  all four of them were actually trying to see what my cock looked like   i was shocked and i said ‚Äúwtf are you doing‚Äù i was actually pretty mad but who wouldn‚Äôt be you have 5 guys staring at your cock and talking loudly in chinese by now i repeated wtf are you doing  one of the guys poorly spoke english and he said ‚Äúwe want to see black penis hahaha‚Äù and he said it like it was a normal request as if like i was gonna feel sorry for his curiousity and drop my pants to be examined by 5 chinese guys in a toilet at some random bar    i just said you guys are stupid but i don‚Äôt think they understood me as they were caught up in their conversation which i‚Äôm sure was stilll about my cock i didn‚Äôt even finish pissing but i has to leave cuz that made me uncomfortable   i told my friend who was also black everything that happened and started cracking up he was like ‚Äúi should‚Äôve told you about that it always happens‚Äù  and even told me that i‚Äôll have to get used to it if i wanted to survive in china i knew it was gonna be a problem but him associating it with survival sounded absurd    case 2‚Äì   i‚Äôm in shenzhen beautiful city great night life and i wished i had lived there to be honest shenzhen is the electronic of china fyi   i went to shenzen from guangzhou with a group of friends for a weekend of partying sunday morning i wake up early and everyone is sleeping we had a pretty long night and every one didn‚Äôt look like they were gonna wake up anytime soon   so i decided to buy something from shenzen electronic city and all i googled where the nearest mall around me was and i grabbed a taxi and go there i i reached the place and i‚Äôm walking in and from behind i could two older ladies talking loudshouting actually then they started shouting ‚Äúu you‚Äù i turned around and they‚Äôre obviously calling me  i stopped for them they‚Äôre obviously in their 60s short and very loud typical chinese old woman as you‚Äôd expect one of the older ladies holds my arms and without even acknowledging me they‚Äôre still talking i‚Äôm still trying to be nice 60 year olds   then one of them takes out

about you and i insisted for so many says that she tell me  it happened everytime so it was getting annoying too  then she tells me almost crying ‚Äú the reason i don‚Äôt like to be seen with you is

,,,HomiesTrismegistus,black^opiate,i saw a ufo with my friend one time and it scared us both very badly we couldnt believe what we were seeing we got lost in the woods when we were bow fishing on the river and followed all the tributaries for a few miles and forgetting which direction we came from or where we were  we had the idea of there is a train that comes through here lets just wait until we hear it and go in that direction and follow it one way until it hits the road and we can find our car if we go the wrong way we will know sooner or later and just walk opposite we were entirely lost and that was literally our only option because it was becoming night time and both of our phones were dead and we didnt even have a lighter to smoke our pot or cigarettesthat part sucked  anyways so we had been following tributaries or streams forever thinking we would figure out where we were but realistically just getting more lost we heard the train when it was almost night time so we ran in that direction and found a road after seeing some headlights before we ever found tracks we were exhausted and it was great because we could see all the way down because it was farmland a house the car had been going the opposite direction leaving the house so too scared to go up to the housewe were in the middle of nowhere and had seen multiple no trespassing signs so we were scared to let anyone see us and ask where we were we just followed the way the car we saw was driving  on one side of us was the woods that we had just come out of and on the other was a flat plain of farmland all the way to the horizon there was literally nothing there the sun was almost all the way down  but it wasnt quite dark yet there were stars in the sky  we saw plain as daylight this invisible triangular craft hovering about 50 feet off the ground only about 300 feet or so away from us and this thing was huge we could make it out because there were three lights they basically looked like stars all connected by this black in color but almost like a mirror craft we could see the color of the sky behind it and stars reflecting off of it it was almost like it was invisible but we could make it out because of the three lights  it made no noise and the front light would change in its intensity of brightness it would stay the same sizethese lights just looked like stars they were pin pricks of lightbut it would get so bright like if we were looking into the sun and then it would dim back down to what the others looked like it was so bizarre because it stayed the same size and was randomly changing in intensity to where just the pin prick of light would become so bright that we could barely even look at it  we were scared shitless i mean this thing was right in front of us and we still hang out to this day and talk about it i will probably never see something as strange and novel as that again honestly with my personality i thought i would be curious and just walk up to this thing and investigate but seriously we were very scared of it and there was no way in hell we were walking up to that thing  we kept walking and kept our eyes on it for a solid 15 minutes it just stayed silent for a brief minute or so we took our concentration off of it and were talking to each other about it then we look back and its just gone the thing was right next to us and then when we looked back it had literally vanished  im a very skeptical person and even still if people tell me they saw a ufo i tend to not believe them or rationalize it to something else that is more realistic but this really happened to us and neither of us will ever forget it i looked up tons of things when we eventually found the main road leading to our car and drove home it fit the description entirely of these black triangle ufo sightings before we started looking things up we did not even know that this was an actually referenced to type of ufo it spooked us out even more reading some of the stories and how similar it was to what we saw and we were reading that it probably was good we didnt walk up to it because apparently people who have have had cases of diseases caused by what they think was radiation i dont know about all that but we definitely wouldnt have walked up to the thing we had real fear going through us at the sight of that it is such a surreal memoryi wouldnt call myself insane  if you took an opiate such as hydrocodonein its pure form once a week for 5 years and tylenol at 1000mg once a week for 5 years the tylenol would most certainly be more physically destructive than the hydrocodonei had a coworker die because he drank every night and took tylenol every morning everyone was explicitly told that the tylenol he was taking was the absolute main cause not the alcohol and that tylenol is actually responsible for 90 of liver toxicity deaths  i havent taken a tylenol in ten years it is literally just poison and the multiple gram dosage to even try to get rid of a headachewhich barely even works is very much not good for you  why it is the 1 doctor recommended pain reliever is beyond me youre literally better off taking an opiate for your pain as far as physical health goes of course they tend to pump those full of acetominophen as well i do not know how much more healthy ibupofen or naproxen sodium is but in extreme cirumstances i will take naproxen sodium i have basically convinced myself that it works better because of it working with the nmda receptors also kratom although the opioid effect for whatever reason wont get away headaches however is a miracle for the pain i experience from breaking my pelvis in two places after a near fatal car accident they were giving me 60mg oxycodone per day along with a lot of tylenol which i then had no choice but for my body to become physically dependent on thank god for kratom it is healthier than naproxen sodium in my mind even got all sorts of medical tests done a few years later and have had absolutely nothing go wrong with my body the fact they are trying to ban it literally lives up with the conspiracies of big pharma wanting the population to be addicted to opiates kratom and marijuana stand in front of their profits interesting stuff

,,,Npapa01,opioid,no problem   the primary difference between drugs like etizolam xanax and diazepam and drugs like phenibut is that the former bind to the benzodiazepine site of the gabaa receptor and modulate gaba transport to occur more frequently while the latter inhibits calcium channels and actually has no direct influence on gaba phenibut being an exception as it binds to the gabab receptor   i have no idea if kindling has anything to do with gabapentin wd sensitivity but given that the ‚Äòpentin‚Äôs have inhibitory effects similar to gaba it‚Äôs not too far fetched to think so   kindling is usually discussed in the context of opioid drugs and gabaab agonists modulators but is likely involved in most systems a good example to look at when trying to understand kindling is binge drinking binge drinking is actually more damaging than consistent alcoholism to an extent because when withdrawing from alcohol your now uninhibited glutamate levels skyrocket while glutamate is important for normalizing your receptors it can also damage important neurological systems and worsen receptor uncoupling loss of receptors repeating this process over and over again leads to more damage unbalance and uncoupling making you far more sensitive to withdrawals and damage from alcoholwell kinda so to start alcohol is poorly understood from a pharmacological standpoint but is believed to mediate its effects through gaba    ‚Äú in any case ethanol has long shown a similarity in its effects to positive allosteric modulators of the gabaa receptor like benzodiazepines barbiturates and various general anesthetics1952 indeed ethanol has been found to enhance gabaa receptormediated currents in functional assays1952 in accordance it is theorized and widely believed that the primary mechanism of action is as a gabaa receptor positive allosteric modulator‚Äù   with regard to opioid drugs a study on kindling can be found here  httpswwwncbinlmnihgovmpubmed7200381   the tldr is that opioid kindling exists but does not have much application to your original question   now i can‚Äôt find any studies on the existence of gabapentinoid kindling phenibut gabapentin etc however from reading countless anecdotes on reddit i‚Äôve found that people who abused and then coldturkey‚Äôd phenibut experience a very similar phenomenon besides the sometimes horrid ct withdrawals with similar symptoms to alcohol wd they seem to experience significant postacute withdrawal symptoms for months following abstinence whereas people who tapered slowly do not often experience paws additionally those who abused and wd‚Äôd from phenibut report that even years later they‚Äôre unable to ‚Äúfeel the magic‚Äù that they once did after dosing phenibut    the existence of paws and blunted effects upon relapse suggest long term or even permanent changes to brain chemistry following withdrawal something we‚Äôve partially connected to the kindling phenomenon in benzodiazepines moreover this phenomenon is predominantly found in users who did not taper andor experienced severe withdrawals which indicates that a mechanism similar to the glutamate rebound found in benzos may be occurring   to answer your last question it‚Äôs both people like to explain tolerance and withdrawal through receptor ‚Äòdownregulation‚Äô when in reality that‚Äôs likely not the case the only evidence supporting that theory is from animal studies using incredibly high doses which fails to explain how nightly use of a normal dose of a short acting benzodiazepine produces dependence    so with alcohol following an episode of heavy binge drinking a 45 fold increase in glutamate release occurs that much glutamate causes neuronal cell death brain damage and neuronal destruction specifically the withdrawals change ampa receptors a type of glutamate receptors in areas of the brain that control anxiety and seizure threshold making that person more susceptible to anxiety and seizures repeating this process over and over again progressively makes the withdrawals worse more anxiety  seizures this is likely the primary mechanism behind neuronal kindling

,,,-mjneat,opium^opiates^dreams^opiate^black,ketamine fucked me up as well i only used for 2 years but it was 23 grams each day i once ordered 50gs from a website forgot i ordered iti was high woke up to a package i had to sign for and went on a bender that last 2 days and i went through 18gs gave the rest to a friend and quit ive used over 150 different drugs and ketaminemxe to an extent as well had me hook line and sinker ive even had opium lying around ive managed to use a few times a month with no issues but ketamine just had me in its grips unlike anything else i ever tried  im around 8 129 years off now the only way i got sober is when the whole country went dry around 9 years ago my dealer only really sold to me by the end didnt help they lived in a flat beneath me i still get a funky feeling bladder every now and again and i will never forget the bladdergallbladder spasms that usedd to have me curled up in pain for 6 hours at a timeheroin and opiates generally are not so amazing that you really want to take it againminus iv maybe ive done probably half an o of heroin over the years and only once had minor withdrawals the thing with them though is theres no hangover or comedown if you dont iv your quite likely to think whats all the fuss about the problem is the high grows on you and it totally relieves any amount of anxiety you have i use opium at max once a week and have done for 8 years with only 2 bouts of minor withdrawal after 34 days of use in the first year after going through that first opium tea withdrawal i knew not to get addicted to it again and its been a sunday treat for me for years now when i feel that psychological addiction starting to take hold i take a few months off and i have at least a week off every month that i do do itso 34 sundays of the month ill use also when i run out of poppies i take a few months off  its nt impossible to use opiates reasonably but i think it gets a lot harder when it comes to iving also ppt is a bit of a pain to prepare unlike racking up a line or prepping iv iirc only 20 of recreational opiate users end up being problematic users funny thing is thoughh ive had plenty of addictions to other drugs but opiates scare me a little because of the physical aspect of the addiction ketamine for example absolutely hooked me hook line and sinker i used to im ketamine so i know how much more addictive the needle is compared to other roas  still wouldnt suggest recreational opiate use to anyone though but its not quite like its made outmost drugs have limited physical withdrawal effects outside of opiates and downers like alcoholbenzos ive been taking opioid 23 times a month for around 6 years with only having a mild wd once but i smoked cannabis for 15 years daily i can have opiates lying around because i know they are physically addictive and that is a trigger for me to take a break  because weed doesnt present many wd symptoms and doesnt impact you to the point of not being functioning its almost a more insideous addiction because you believe everything is fine and its not a problem im pretty sure a lot of people who claim it has no negative effects have just not tried being sober for a while and dont want to quit i do 100 get rebound rem nightmares and sweats when i quit though weed 100 has withdrawal effect theyre just not that bad and honestly physical addition isnt nearly as bad as a psychological addition anyway so people saying its only psychological and nothing to be worried about are kidding themselves  its fine to smoke weed but its not a cure all harmless drug like a lot of people like to believe and this is coming from someone who has always loved cannabis its not the devil drug that a lot of people believe either and has a lot of benefits but also has numerous drawbacks if its overusedeverything has its price even weed ime i find it easy if i haven‚Äôt got it but abstaining if i do isn‚Äôt as easy it stresses me out for a day or two and gives me bizzare dreams for a week or more i used and abused most types of drugs and cannabis seems to be the most forgiving but long term heavy use isn‚Äôt without some risks and there is a wd period to it it‚Äôs just minor in comparison to most other drugs   a lot of people think of cannabis as being a perfect drug with no negative effects which isn‚Äôt the whole story either and will dismiss the fact that a weed smoker can also be an addict and experience problems stoppingdefinitely less addictive than opiates opiates are just really easy to use all the time because you can pretty much function without impairment they are kind of like the perfect drug for any time i would say alcohol is much worse to come off thoughfrom my experience with mild ghb and benzo addiction alcohol isnt exactly easy to get addicted to if your in a good place in your life you have to be hammering it for years really and the hangover becomes a pain in the ass when you get older opiates though your tolerance can build pretty quickly especially if you have any history of use  this is the closest thing ive heard in regards to the how and why of opiate addiction httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9huwlxfa1si‚Äôm not really a fan of shapiro but i don‚Äôt get the hate monger thing either from what i can see he just has a different viewpoint to the left but he gives his reasoning and it doesn‚Äôt seem based in bias i like peterson as well and really struggle with most of reddittwitters view of him as well i can see how people can take short clips out of context but i don‚Äôt see most of the issues that he‚Äôs always critiques for after watching his classes and lectures his view is a lot more nuanced than people are willing to believe i think it‚Äôs the ‚Äòyou must agree with me or your a bad person‚Äô polarization that the internet seems to foster there is no more grey just different shades of black and whitei got into weed because my friend gave me hash cake when i was 14 it went from smoking weed to pretty much everything else when i turned 18 ketamine was my first real drug addiction though that stuff really got me hook line and sinker got over the ketamine and continued to use a plethora of different drugs an rcs at some point during my k addiction i developed a benzo habit which ruined me slowly and took 18 months to fully get over after 10 months of abuse do not abuse benzos its so not worth it mostly sober these daysalthough i am drinking some opium at the moment turns out i was self medicating adhd and since i have been prescribed ritalin then my cravings have dropped through the floor and i can control my drug use which is a strange feeling  im not really a data analyst even though i do spend a fair amount of time doing that these days i work in the education sector in a small business delivering work based learning weve grown over the 12 years ive been there so were 10x the size so my role went from managing small networks to helping scale and redesign what and how we do things i do some systems admin but thats mostly down to the msp we have on hand i tend to do things like powershell scripting to automate the creation of learners from one system to another i support my boss on a lot of bi stuff because he knows what we need and enough of pbi to get the job done and i fill in when hes struggling with the dax or sql or just figuring out how best to do what he says we need i also setup and maintain our sql database that pulls datasets from different sources and standardizes the data into its own structure so any changes or additional fields we need i need to write the sql to automate from our hosted dbshared inbetween a few companies so its off site and to import locally after transferring via ftpall automated   i do spend a fair bit of time maintaining training laptops or doing tech support if the msp cannot fix the issues we had one issue where onedrive wasnt displaying anything in the online version and i had to troubleshootafter ms support couldnt fix it that required me brushing up on the client side object model to generate a new view since the functionality isnt in the gui knowing that onedrive is basically sharepoint i thought it was quite likely i could use the sharepoint libraries on the od platform and it worked in terms of sysadmin i probably do more with o365 than the onsite infrastructure because i setup and maintain the sharepoint sites and other o365 services im hoping that ill be doing more development work since were at a point where i think thats what we need to do to grow further im kind of a jack of all trades when it comes to it which is pretty common to be honest when it comes to small businesses and it if your generally interested in it then a small business is the place for you as long as your quick enough to learn whatever you need to in relatively short notice periods it keeps you fresh but it can also wear you down if you want to specialize in something then a bigger business is where you want to be because they are unlikely to have a few people doing everything  if your interested in data science some things you can do is web scraping using beautiful soup for python you can essentially turn any website into an api with web scraping which means anything on the www can be your dataset i had done some python courses in data analysis on courser a few years that was a pretty good intro into the whole field i have the book the course was based on here in front of me called python for informatics  exploring information if your interested powerbi is a lot easier to churn out the dashboards though so you focus more on getting the right data instead of coding the whole thing out i am hoping to look into the ai models that are common in python though once we finish v1 of the dashboards  good luck if you ever need a chat drop me a pmi was more talking about the everyone has nightmares therefor its not the weed comment all im saying is there are negative effects from quitting recreational drugs and everyone is different also that because its psychological and not physical doesnt necessarily mean thats any better the most damaging addiction i had was to ketamine and thats not generally seen as an addictive drug to most people the drug i abused most was probably weed because it seems so innocuous but the full range of its effects were not really clear to me until i stopped using for a good while and went backsuch as how it can heighten anxiety most drugs are not physically addictive in the way benzos or opiates are but most drugs will present some physical sings of withdrawal if they are used long enoughahh that sucks but i can see it happening even if a lot will say its all in your head as i got older weed seemed to go from doesnt effect me whatsoever to i have to be pretty careful with it it seems to cause me anxiety if i overuse these days whereas i used to be able to just smoke through it i still can but i dont want to force myself into an anxious state for the sake of it  i struggle with insomnia and depression so i know how those feels funnily enough since i cut down on my smoking and got off benzos its so much better i always thought weed was helping and it kind of did but turns out i was medicating unmedicated adhd which was a cause of my sleep disorder and unhappy disposition im of the belief that most heavy drug users self medicate to some extent so if your still in that lifestyle try and get it under control quitting benzos was the hardest thing ive done but it eventually made a lot of my anxiety related issues go down to basically non existent  weed really helps me sleep which is one of the reasons i wish i could have a bit lying around so i can smoke just before bed but it always without fail leads me to smoking more and more through the day i went from a pipe a night to 35gs a day within a week last time i tried that its such a strange drug when it comes to addiction i wouldnt call it addictive  in the sense opiates or cocaine are but because for most people the wd is minimal it makes it way too easy to abuse and if you keep it up over years then you essentially forget what being sober and having a clear mind is like  i need to find a good hash dealer because im not really a massive fan of the super strength high thc weed everyone seems to love i much prefer a good amount of cbd to level out the thc and i never get anxious from hash try hash if you can it helped me cut down massively went from smoking 35gs a day to using a pipe to cut out tobacco and eventually moved to hash and since i done that i no longer feel the need to always havetherefor always smoke it lying around and i can take it or leave it these day mostlyye but it only happens after i stop smoking its not a coincidence ive been smoking it for 15 years and only a few years started taking regular breaks what your saying is like saying to an opiate addict that its not withdrawal everyone is sick and sweats at some point not related at all or telling a benzo addict that its all in their head and not physical just because the major symptoms are anxietymy mother had metal plates in her back and some sort of metal brace along with shaving parts of her spine off 6 months recovery time and to start off they gave her apap and ibuprofen this is in the uk not the us had to tell my old man how ridiculous that is for an op like that i get none for minor operations but she was in terrible pain for weeks even after she finally got some tramadol   its like they only want to give them to terminal cancer patients and even then their pretty strict i get opiates are addictive but they are the gold standard for pain relief for a reason even then you could solve the addiction in

,,,ChiTownChick,opioid^black^gum^opiates^opiate,what is wrong with being an atheistagnostic i disagree that faith can fix the opioid crisis  i‚Äôm not trying to start anything that‚Äôs just my two centsspoilers    i agree with this poster he writes whatever he wants to op are you saying you didn‚Äôt enjoy san junipero imo that was one of the best episodes of black mirror also as this poster is saying there are only so many bad endings you can write  i have always loved this show for being as dark as it is having an occasional good ending mixes things up san junipero was incredible i also loved hang the dj   it‚Äôs more about twists imo yes most episodes are dark and bleak but even the lighter episodes have awesome twists   it did become more americanized and i was concerned that it would affect the show in a bad way but imo i don‚Äôt think it was yes early episodes like white bear and white christmas were amazing because of their dark twisted endingsyou‚Äôre so strong to be able to quit unfortunately patches have never helped me personally but gum did i think if i did gum and really stuck to a regiment i could be smoke free by my birthday september   anyway back to the case i agree with you that the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù between lisa and michelle was more in michelle‚Äôs head it did feel like michelle fantasizing in real time you‚Äôre right that michelle lied about a lot of things i also believe people who say they were raped but michelle was changing her stories about that all the time she was a known liar i‚Äôm a survivor and sometimes you convince yourself that x happened so you don‚Äôt feel as bad and then after therapy you realize y happened i‚Äôm not saying she was raped and i always believe the survivor i‚Äôm saying you have a really good point about her changing her story and then saying it didn‚Äôt happen at all  as far as lisa goes i think she did have feelings for her but they were one sided i think you‚Äôre right about why lisa‚Äôs mother cut off their friendship it seems like michelle could be a pathological liar to get attention such as saying conrad raped her and then saying they got to third base i know we‚Äôve discussed this a lot but despite her lying issues i do think that her confession was true we don‚Äôt have to discuss it you have your opinion and i have mine and honestly we will never know who‚Äôs right   conrad did have a history of multiple suicide attempts i think if michelle has called his mom things would be much different today i don‚Äôt know why he wasn‚Äôt institutionalized he should have been put in a residential program like i was i‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs his family‚Äôs fault at all but they should‚Äôve looked into residentials my family was able to get the state to pay because it was too expensive but they didn‚Äôt do it alone the therapeutic day school i went to helped them contact the right people i was like conrad as a teenager my last suicide attempt was using my mom‚Äôs back pills  oxycontin and norco plus valium and dilation i was already in residential but it was abusive after that attempt i was put in a room that was empty for 6 months  i wasn‚Äôt allowed clothes or anything else i‚Äôd understand maybe a month but 6 there‚Äôs so much i could say but this isn‚Äôt about me it wasn‚Äôt because they were worried it was because the therapist took it personally thankfully jewish children‚Äôs services investigated and saw proof of emotional abuse such as 3 hour ‚Äúsessions‚Äù  monitored phone calls and when i couldn‚Äôt tell my parents how bad it was i wrote letters which were intercepted it gave me ptsd and i had physically painful nightmares for years sorry to go off i do think conrad would‚Äôve benefited from a good residential treatment facility i think his mom was so surprised because he was doing ‚Äúwell‚Äù outwardly   i absolutely agree about the glee connection it sounds crazy that there was one but when you look at things michelle said after cory montieth died it is very clear there was a connection i think she follow his death and lea michelle‚Äôs words obsessively i remember when chris benoit died and what he did my brother was a big wwe fan and he was really upset after it happened i wasn‚Äôt into wrestling but i was upset after it happened it was total tragedy   i definitely agree with you she wanted to be lea michelle she wanted to be the woman who had the dead boyfriend but was strong through out it all maybe she did want to be a singeractress or maybe she just wanted the attention i agree with you she became more insistent the closer it came to the anniversary of cory‚Äôs death she did also mention contemplating conrad‚Äôs death after cory died i really enjoy talk to you about what happened between michelle and  conrad and how michelle factored into his deathoh i can definitely relate to that i‚Äôve known people in my life who had schadenfreude when i was struggling it‚Äôs messed up trying to get you to start smoking again are the fucking worst it‚Äôs hard enough to quit i‚Äôve tried many times and it is so hard you‚Äôre stronger than me to be able to quit  just a side question how did you quit the gum helps but it‚Äôs more about me being able to toughen up when it gets hard   i agree with you about michelle being bisexual i figured even if something did happen with that girl her mother and her would never admit it i don‚Äôt think it was only because that girl may have been bisexual and her mother who maybe didn‚Äôt know and they wanted it to be a secret it to look like michelle was a crazy sociopath who would say anything for attention i agree she had issues with being dramatic and wanting attention but i do believe she had genuine feelings for that girl i think her name was lisa   i didn‚Äôt know his death was on the anniversary of cory montieth‚Äôs death i think that could explain her extreme insistence that he do it as soon as possible i also know that people who‚Äôve made up their mind about ending their life usually will do so however her insistence seemed to make him less sure and actually going through with it i know we will probably disagree on this one point but i think he could‚Äôve been helped i do think cory montieth‚Äôs death definitely had a huge impact on her remember when she started saying weird things and he was like why‚Äôre you saying this stuff and she just appeared to be obsessed with cory montieth‚Äôs death and lea michelle  that‚Äôs her name right if she hadn‚Äôt been the little devil whispering and sometimes yelling in his ear i think he could‚Äôve made it they should‚Äôve been kept apart if she‚Äôd just texted his mother with whom she kept in contact with then there is a possibility he‚Äôd be alive i‚Äôm saying this with experience with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts sometimes i‚Äôd get extremely suicidal but i was like conrad and did research when i found out that i‚Äôd have to take my mom‚Äôs oxycontin norco valium and dilantin to really do it i was ready to die then when i woke up i tried to tell my mom i‚Äôd taken pills she thought i just got high and i was taken back to the emotionally abusive residential that jewish children‚Äôs services eventually came to the conclusion that there was abuse and i was removed  long story but my point being i was thought i was resigned to die but i wasn‚Äôt   i think if conrad was medicated and in a partial hospitalization program or full residential then i truly think without the michelle factor he‚Äôd still be alive that‚Äôs just my opinion he had tried to commit suicide but no one is beyond help imoi had a couple extremely close friends when i was dealing with my anorexia and anxiety i think she had issues with being overdramatic as well and wanted attention it was very obvious i had an ed too at 14 i got down to 87lbs at 5‚Äô5 although the girl i thought was my bff ditched me afterwards my mom was going to take us to six flags for my birthday and then she was supposed to spend the night she called me and said she couldn‚Äôt go she said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt your medicine make you tired‚Äù and i was like ‚Äúwhat are you talking about‚Äù  i think she was trying to trick me into admitting i was on psych meds but i wasn‚Äôt she also started saying bad things about me and openly flirting with my long term first serious love  we were together for 2 years but i realized she was just jealous and started getting really close to another couple girls and then there was my real bff  he was a guy and we‚Äôd been really close for years we‚Äôd talk on the phone for hours and had so many inside jokes he was my bf‚Äôs best friend first and then we became really close  sorry to go off on a tangent my point was it wasn‚Äôt really her ed and other problems as much as she was an attention seeker and had a flair for the dramatic which would make people dislike her   the relationship with the girl was mentioned in the hbo documentary her relationship with conrad became unhealthy almost right away she asked if they were going to get married and he asked her what was wrong she got very upset and said why why she got the attention she needed from him most of the time but was still a dramatic girl  yes she was intense and did lie for attention but i truly believe that she confessed to that girl months later because she felt guilty i don‚Äôt think any of that text was a lie it is depressing she was the weird dramatic girl who told lies for attention and it ultimately got a guy to commit suicide   i am considering her past lies and behavior when i say i think she did tell him to get in the truck and was even freaking out about getting caught i think she was spinning out because she finally realized that she was a part of her boyfriend‚Äôs death telling that girl that she told him to get back in and also saying she felt guilty but at the same time was afraid of getting in trouble it‚Äôs complicated but i don‚Äôt think that was a lie if she‚Äôd texted it right after he died then yeah i‚Äôd say lie but it was months after and she realized she was fucked   when i say she grew a conscious i don‚Äôt mean she became a completely different person i think she felt guilty and as far as her lack of apology or taking any responsibility well i don‚Äôt think she was there she may never be there part of her feels guilty but the most important person in her life is her and i don‚Äôt think she still fully gets it i don‚Äôt think she lied but i also don‚Äôt think she fully comprehends what she‚Äôs done she can be of two minds about it she can feel guilty but she can also feel like she didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble   when i said she had a lot of supporters i should‚Äôve said that there are people who think she got the raw end of the deal because she has issues i think because of how redhanded  was defending her so much that there are people out there who feel she shouldn‚Äôt have been charged or that she should‚Äôve gotten more sympathy from the press as far as the press goes i think her portrayal as a black widow to a defenseless teenager is wrong she was very isolated and no publications really delved into her issues or anything at least redhanded took a side that was totally different than others maybe i‚Äôm wrong but from what you‚Äôve told me about the podcast defending her actions so much i feel like there are people who think the bullying wasn‚Äôt that bad or don‚Äôt believe she ultimately pushed him over the edge that‚Äôs why i loved the hbo thing it shows both sides of the argument during parts of it i did feel for her but i still think she should‚Äôve gotten more time the fact that she never took any responsibility shows that she still doesn‚Äôt believe what she did was all that bad in her mind he was going to do it anyway except when he showed any hesitation she mocked him and got mad at him it is in the document i linked you should at least read the texts i understand what you meant now about redhanded of course it‚Äôs not as objective as a documentary i just don‚Äôt know why they picked her side they read the evidence i understand though that the point of having a podcast is to share your opinion they have a right to their opinion just like we have a right to ours even though we differ on certain things i still feel like we mostly agree i didn‚Äôt know it was 11 months it‚Äôs not nitpicking to correct me lolthank you for saying that it really does mean a lot xx i just hate that i still have that itch  you know the one and i need to scratch it sometimes i can‚Äôt just be on my regular doses sometimes because i miss being opioids and since i don‚Äôt want to really mess up i just stick to occasionally taking extra of medication i‚Äôm on which isn‚Äôt any better than buying it on the street imo i had the chance recently to get some oxy which i used to abuse a lot in my teens when it was still crushable lol and i knew if i did it once  i mean i‚Äôd have to stop taking the zubsolv first for a week which would be hell in and of itself since i‚Äôve experienced suboxone withdrawal and it‚Äôs horrible i‚Äôd keep wanting more and probably go back to h which would ruin my marriage and probably land me jail or in the ground so i didn‚Äôt do it at least i have that at least i know if i ever went back to opiates i‚Äôd be fucked i‚Äôm trying to  do what you‚Äôre doing and take what i‚Äôm prescribed it‚Äôs just really hard my life is going great right now and i still want to get high which makes me feel guilty but i know addiction is a disease and i have to take every victory no matter how small as a huge deal sorry for the long response lolwell most drugs even ones people don‚Äôt abuse like seroqual or ssris cause withdrawal if you suddenly stop taking them gabapentin doesn‚Äôt cause withdrawal like benzos or other gaba drugs it is more of a nuisance than torture like opiate withdrawal or benzo withdrawal trust me i used to abuse it and run early every month then i‚Äôd get insomnia restlessness and some anxiety but it‚Äôs nothing compared to benzo withdrawal which i have been through as well which causes seizures and psychosis just to name two symptoms you‚Äôre overthinking it just take it as prescribed and you‚Äôll be fine gabapentin isn‚Äôt a gaba drug like ambien or klonopini know cigs are bad for your health but when i heard that the age had been raised i instantly got angry idk why maybe because i started smoking a month before my 18th birthday and then on my birthday i bought my first pack of cigarettes i shouldn‚Äôt have been upset since i can obviously buy cigarettes now but i sympathize with all the smokers who were suddenly  screwed i‚Äôm sorry op i tried to quit a couple times and it was horrible the gum really does help though the patches never did anything but the gum did you‚Äôll get through this op it‚Äôs better that quit now i regret that i‚Äôve been a smoker for 14 years

,,,DamiensLust,opioid,so full disclosure she wasnt an influencer and it wasnt a photo shoot request and im not a photographer but there was this one time when the girl i was seeing was picking up a little extra cash by babysitting her niece which was very very easy money since her niece was 7 years old  an angel super wellbehaved my partners sister was married to a very wealthy guy and so they hired a couple of cleaners who came in a few times a week to keep the place spickandspan   a short while prior to the evening in question a nontrivial amount of money had gone missing out of the house so they had installed some spy cams around the house as they wanted to catch the perpetrator rather than just firing everybody and hiring new people   me  my partner had been together a couple of years at this point and things needed to be livened up in the bedroom the real cause of which was my opioid addiction that id been maintaining secretly but thats another story after she had put her niece to bed we got close on the sofa and one thing led to another  we ended up having sex we went upstairs to the guest bedroom just so wed be alerted if her sister came back early for some reason and she started rooting around for condoms she found some  along with a bunch of sex toys many of which looked new one of these was a 6 inch strapon i was immediately less than enthusiastic about the prospect and my first excuse was that it cant possibly be hygienic to share something like that but she pointed out that there were 4 different detachable dildos and 3 of them were still shrinkwrapped inside the box   i really wasnt up for it and had the situation been different i would have shot down the suggestion but the circumstances of our relationship meant that i was in direneed of some good boyfriend credit  my habit at the time had meant i was emotionally  mentally distant which she had rightfully picked up on and i could feel her mutually drifting away i was becoming worried about losing her since she was my anchor to a normal life and the one thing that had stopped me from jumping down the rabbithole headfirst and i just knew that if i lost her then i wouild spiral out of control i also knew that her ex had been into a lot of sm stuff and that he had taken her to a place called the torture garden and theyd done a lot of kinky shit together though id never have suggested it or gone for it under normal circumstances i figured that if gritting my teeth and clenching my fists while my girlfriend pounded me in the ass was the price to pay to stop the best part of my life from evaporating  then so be it   to keep it sfw ill spare the details i will say though that it really wasnt as unpleasant as i expected and that my girlfriend was into it a lot more than i thought she would be if i had been unsure before afterwards i was certain that that wasnt her first rodeo   anyway we finished up my girlfriend took the dildo detached from the strapon at my insistence replaced it all and we went back to watching tv until her sister came back about a week later having forgotten all about it we were invited over for dinner the two of them made quite a lot of ambiguous comments that i didnt think much of at first  are you ok you look like youre still sore take a bigger piece if you want damienslust we know you love taking the meat etc we both started suspecting something at some point and then 50 double entendre and innuendos later the conversation got onto the money that went missing and my partners brotherinlaw said we never found out where that money went it was definitely taken but whoever it was must have grown a conscience or maybe noticed the cameras theyre quite subtle though  youd never know they were here but theyre all over the house theres one over here in the living room in carlas room in the guest bedroom  i bet you guys didnt see it at all last week did you and then the two of them started laughing   fortunately they both found it very funny i was left a little redfaced but both of us apologized and took it as well as we could after dinner my partner even asked if they wanted to play the video and before i could say absolutely not they told us that it had been deleted after he had found it while reviewing the footageafter showing it to my partners sister first of course so not quite a photo shoot but for a period of time quite an outrageous and embarrassing video of me existed and i wonder from time to time if they really did delete it or if it still exists on their laptop   i know this was pretty distinct from the question the op asked and i figured that though it was pretty irrelevant its a story ive been waiting to tell and i figured id post it here where it will be buried but at least it will be off my chest

life i just choose to quit to actually have my own space and piece of mind  i knew i wasn‚Äôt suffering from chronic pain i just switched from my xanax script to my plugs norcos then perks then morphine and hydromorphone  that whole time i wasn‚Äôt on my meds i need i need to be chilled i‚Äôm a hothead through childhood don‚Äôt like if someone makes a joke about me i feel like i always have to stand up it‚Äôs the anxiety and ptsd working  now i‚Äôm on benzos yes some friday and saturday nights i turn in early cause i‚Äôm on schedule but it feels good to have control over sleep eating and work and money  trust me man i‚Äôve been off the everyday pills since end of november suboxone till last week and i‚Äôm here now battling lil things but happy you‚Äôll get thereno i feel there‚Äôs a difference in going into a relationship with opiate addiction and going into a relationship clean then ending up using your thoughts and heart will play at you if you really love that person it‚Äôs why i wrote a ranta good doctor would put the fact of that weed causes paranoia into my lifestyle i barely can get by with it anymore on painkillers it was just another thing to bring a high now it‚Äôs like ew i don‚Äôt want a headache sometimes at night when i‚Äôm on my medicine i do a dab of weed shatter or wax for a good sleep and if a doctor prescribes a chronic pain patient 120 vics 10s every month cause of pain from leg surgeries his education is probably right if a doctor wants me to have 60 xanax 2s a month for my mental illness‚Äôs again education better than yours   i wasn‚Äôt me with out it and when i was first prescribed xanax my first benzo this doctor did separate visits with psych talkers and therapy always there never forced it on me if anything told me consequently what could happen with addiction   which is easier for me than opiatesi‚Äôm back and forth from doing it only way out is suboxone in my opinion takes the withdrawals mostly away and after a week you can be full functioning on it my advice take 8mg once a day for 3 days then cut down to 6 for a week 4 2 etc and then stop subs before you get addicted to those  you can message me i also tell people see a therapist or psych doctor dopamine interest is different for everyone some people don‚Äôt have as much as others same with serotonin happiness there‚Äôs benzos and ssris and even ptsd medication or just plain sleep medication  but a doctor can ask you about your life and figure out why you need a crutch like h to get by although just say you‚Äôre on opiates not heroin   i was figured out to be depressed ptsd and hypertension with anxiety so the manic version  ill admit i‚Äôm 20 year old male who was prolly raped while i was young by a blood brother of mine so it makes sense why later in life i was confused with feelings and did drugs to ignore or face the fact that i‚Äôm one of those

,,,TirelessGuerilla,china^opium^black,theres actually a lot of the first cases that trace people that didnt go to the market and the believed to be patient zero didnt go to the market as well to be honest im leaning more towards the theory that its from the lab its documented a chinese man who works in the wuhan lab worked on and wrote a paper in an american university where they got a bat corona virus to infect humans thats a pretty big coincidence look at the conspiracy subreddit for the documentation im too lazy to post it dont get me wrong it could definitely be that nasty ass market with its bat soup but i dont really believe in coincidences this big at the same time also as a bonus when china constructed the bio research lab to save face they did not get input from other countries on how to build such a lab and when it was being built people were worried that things would escape from itwe wont know until it gets worse outside of china because china has a record of not reporting accurate numbers in times like these remember sarsok man look heroin becomes morphine in your body opium has morphine in it what do you thinkas a tangent i would like it known that those companies are a complete fraud and people have sent the same genetic sample to multiple companies and each one gave them different results you literally cannot trust those companies anyways skin color doesnt have to do with africans are less evolved its because people need to synthesize vitamin d and having white skin in africa will get you killed from sun radiation and having black skin in norway will get you killed from lack of vitamin d synthesisjust taper with whatever you have then its all morphine just do it until your not throwing up and then stop before your high people smoke opium out of those long opium pipes but i assume chasing the dragon on foil would work too but idk ive never had it either man

bunch of rich white people arguing on stage where most of what they say are lies the other day 3 of the smartest people in the country couldnt identity a picture of adam schiff on jeopardy most americans are not clued in  sure biden had more support right now but only because of obama i guarantee most people who dont pay attention to politics cannot articulate a single difference between the 3 front runners so they support biden because of name recognition and the media links biden to a hero of the black community obama just like when obama was elected the narrative is he didnt have black support until he won iowa no most black people didnt even know who obama was until he won iowa because his press coverage blew up   my point at last who cares about how much black support biden has support doesnt matter getting people out to vote is what matters and its obvious that biden is not going to get blacks out to vote like obama did so while they are an important voting blockobama win because he got a lot of blacks to the polls who normally could have cared less about politics we have trump because americans are starting to realize that politicians are a ruling class of people who are all currupt many bernie supporters something like 20 voted for trump after he lost the primary if bernie wins the primary a lit of trumps support will disappear peole are tired of the establishment   i was laughing at the anger over cnns treatment of bernie like you people think a multinational company like cnn is going to support a populist who wants to overthrow the elites and brjng power back to the people im sorry but im 100 voting for trump and a good economy before i vote for an establishment candidate like biden and i guarantee most americans agreenot to minimize black subjugation but you guys were hardly the first people that were enslaved via the bible christianity and religion as a whole honestly almost as long as there has been organized religion it has been used to preach to subjugated people i mean its core principal that this life is filled with misery and that only by following the laws of those in charge will you get to paradise and that is where real life begins has been used to control enslaved people since its inceptionstaged the last thing his campaign wants is for people to realize that a lot of people still dont agree with being gay like do whatever you do but they dont agree an especially black and people like mexicans who are very religious i mean i dont give a fuck who dude loves or fucks but a lot of people dohow about closing the borders and now allow any chinese visa holders in for a set period of time i mean its lunar new year and a women was already caught going to france infected because she didnt want to spoil her vacation and bragged on social media i know we can close them all the way and ships arrive with chinese goods and workers daily but if china is going to create this issues they need to be quarantined eatjng fucking rats and snakes and wolf puppies fuck china your government needs to control everything but could care less about wild game that spreads diseasesso 2 studies said 12 and another said 6 but that coupled with those who just skipped the general definitely had an impact now with a great economy i imagine that this would play out the same this coming election   either way recent reports show trump with 30 support in the black community i know the study is contested but the point remains most people judge a president on the economy because like i said earlier people recognize that regardless of the party in power little actually changes for the average american over the last 60 years each party has held enough power to do as they wish and little has changed   people see bernie as an outsider and rightly so he doesnt belong in the democratic party now as much as i would live to see the reforms he is promoting congress is still controlled by the elites and like the

,,,lzbumblebee,dreams,first off thank you for introducing us myself to this lesswrong community‚Äîi found it incredibly fascinating and wholly aligned with my own journey of creating new foundational beliefs systems and rituals for myself‚Äîperhaps this plays a bit into divination and the timely randomness of happenstance  to speak more directly to this essay and your post in general reading through the essay itself and some of the comments i noted how it was elaborated on how divination and i suppose mysticism and ritual as a whole were communal activities‚Äîa system that essentially encapsulated the superstition of man and the need for a more streamlined and ordered society is mysticism real is there merit in a belief in ‚Äúspirit‚Äù or a higher power or ‚Äúdivine‚Äù cosmic plan an ultimate ultimate as a favorite writer of mine once said is intuitive belief or knowing a ‚Äúthing‚Äù and how does one who calls themselves a skeptic or agnostic in belief or secular as the name of this sub implies come to terms with their use of such traditional divination tools like tarot despite saying it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúmeditative‚Äù tool  i don‚Äôt know if i wholly believe in the randomness of tarot as noted in the essay‚Äîcomments below it mentioned probability and needing to make sure that your own core and system of beliefs and philosophy aligned with whatever divination system you were utilizing but i have found myself wading between the waters that tarot awakens a suppressed subconscious through its universal imagery and pictorial representation   and that maybe ‚Äúmore‚Äù is actually at play whether i believe that‚Äôs a greater power i‚Äôm less inclined to believe but perhaps there is a collective consciousness a biological down to the shared dna means of connection that evokes a similar call and response in each of us i say that as someone who is a practicing psychonaut a creative and someone who strongly believes in community and the necessity of returning to and creating rituals for mourning for moving forward for celebration etc to get us back to a more grounded and authentic way of existing and being  for myself personally i have been using tarot as a meditative tool but i‚Äôd be lying if i didn‚Äôt say i don‚Äôt get a spooky ‚Äúwoo‚Äù there‚Äôs more at play behind the scenes feeling when certain cards jump out and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù to me or my current situations it feels too uncanny to be dismissive about some thing that something wants me to pay close attention to or reengage a reassurance of belief in‚Äîbut again is this my own subconscious projecting itself or more and does it really matter  i was going to make a post about it and still may about how sometimes tarot cards and their images will come randomly and without prompting into dream i had one such occasion and it is either buried subconscious knowledge or that more i was speaking of‚Äîbut ultimately it doesn‚Äôt matter the tarot dreams gave me a hope and a shift in perspective i would have never had maybe sometimes it‚Äôs best not to so much question the alleged source but instead take the message

,,,OpiatedMinds,opioid^dreams^opiates,definitely go with the methadone suboxone wont really get you any sort of high it isnt even a full agonist with methadone its a full agonist its actually a great long lasting high but like anything else you will get a tolerance to it unlike suboxone you can keep increasing your dose up until a point some people are on huge doses and you may enjoy it to some extent but just be aware that you will be on it all the time your system will be saturated and you wont really get much of a high from it like you are imagining more like you will be mildly high all of the time if youve ever been on a really long oxy binge to where you take some and hardly feel it because you already have so much in your system it will be kinda like that  it will also be a nightmare if you ever decide you want to get off of it they want you on a really high dose so you dont get any cravings and also it destroys your tolerance so you wont even bother seeking out heroin or fent or oxy because it wont even do anything for you and will be a complete waste of money    so yeah i would go with the methadone but it wont be like you think in the beginning you might get right off of it and love it but eventually you will likely come to regret it they call it liquid handcuffs for a reason ive never been on mat and ive thought along the lines youre thinking but i realize my addiction isnt so severe i can cold turkey or maintain on kratom and just get high on some opioid from time to timeso i can still have that escape and release and enjoyment but just exercise some control over itlike someone else said it is extremely mentally addicting ive taken breaks before trying to quit and its crazy i like to listen to music when i shoot or smoke it and hearing a song i used to listen to during that rush would give me that anxiety and sick feeling in the pit of my stomach i would have dreams where i would have a ton of shit but for whatever reason i couldnt get off it seems to be a rule that in using dreams you cant get high its frustrating just telling you through dreams that you are still wanting it   its not a physical addiction at all its a pure mental craving that manifests with physical symptoms like the anxiety that you described you arent physically addicted though dont worry it will go away though dont worry man i feel like it probably took me 6 months to a year eventually it got to the point that i would laugh about the thought of using i realized how crazy it was and had no desire to use at all then i ended up getting some coke one day and decided to try shooting it and now im stuck back in that trap  just stay clean try not to dwell on it and the craving and the physical manifestations of the mental craving will eventually be gone you just got to put time between yourself and it and it will get more and more manageable to where you can think about it and instead of dwelling on the rush you can think about the comedown and the money wasted and all of the negatives and laugh the idea away youll get there if you want to stay clean dont worry it wont haunt you foreveropiates and freebase go together perfectly freebase by itself can make people horribly fiendish and willing to steal and do horrible things for another hit they opiates and cocaine both have positives and negatives opiates have no nasty comedown and not as mentally addicting but there is the physical addiction cocaine especially smoked or injected has a much stronger psychological pull but it doesnt have that physical addiction and once the comedown fades its not so bad  the key is moderation for both and when used together they balance beautifully yin and yang the cocaine spices up the dope and mitigates some of the respiratory depression danger though the cocaine wears off quicker which can cause the opioid to kick back in to dangerous levels when it wears off and the opioid just about entirely eliminates the cocaine comedown and makes it fiendfree  so i must say they are both bad in their own rights and good in their own rights it just depends on the care and selfcontrol of the person using

getting high but that is all bullshit after all is said and done theres so much more joy to be had in life love and hope for a better future that opiates just deny us when we are usingi went through subutex treatment in the uk and it was relatively painless i was smoking heroin regularly  i cant quantify it but it was a lot and i was in a bad state then i went on 8 mg subs per day for about a year before i tapered down to 04mg and stopped there was some discomfort when i stopped but it was totally manageable and didnt cause any real problems  nothing like acute opiate withdrawal  if i were you i would ask the treatment centre about getting on subutexso it is 48 hours since you last used opiates that is encouraging if i understand correctly this should be peak withdrawals right now so should all get better from here  careful with those benzos though do you think you will be able to quit those soon as wellnot sure if its the one you are thinking of but ex oblivione by hp lovecraft is a lovely piece of writing  when the last days were upon me and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim‚Äôs body i loved the irradiate refuge of sleep in my dreams i found a little of the beauty i had vainly sought in life and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods  once when the wind was soft and scented i heard the south calling and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars  once when the gentle rain fell i glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till i reached another world of purple twilight iridescent arbours and undying roses  and once i walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines and pierced by a little gate of bronze  many times i walked through that valley and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral halflight where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk sometimes disclosing the mouldstained stones of buried temples and always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vinegrown wall with the little gate of bronze therein  after a while as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness i would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves and wonder how i might seize them for my eternal dwellingplace so that i need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall i felt that beyond it lay a dreamcountry from which once it was entered there would be no return  so each night in sleep i strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall though it was exceedingly well hidden and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely but more lovely and radiant as well  then one night in the dreamcity of zakarion i found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dreamsages who dwelt of old in that city and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world therein were written many things concerning the world of dream and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate when i saw this lore i knew that it touched on the scenes i had haunted and i therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus  some of the dreamsages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate but others told of horror and disappointment i knew not which to believe yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace so when i learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through i resolved to take it when next i awaked  last night i swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves and when i came this time to the antique wall i saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples and i drifted on songfully expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never return  but as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through i knew that all sights and glories were at an end for in that new realm was neither land nor sea but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space so happier than i had ever dared hoped to be i dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon life had called me for one brief and desolate hourbeing clean and sober not suffering from acute opiate withdrawal having sheltersomewhere to live having someone in my life who cares about me having a job or the ability to make a living somehow having food to eat and not going hungry clean drinking water living in a free and democratic societywill my relatively long taper make it significantly more tolerable than say cold turkeying h to the nasal passage for a few months  not even comparable from my experience i tapered down to 04mg per day and when i stopped it was slightly uncomfortable but entirely manageable i was up early each day looking after a newborn and working lots i had slightly low moods and mild physical achesdiscomfort exercise and stretching was the best thing for alleviating the symptoms which as i say were mild   it is nothing like proper opiate withdrawals  otherwise what would be the point in even using subs in the first place you will be fine

won‚Äôt be leaving her boyfriend anytime soon so do what you need to do to keep your sanity as far as dealing with that goes i‚Äôve found it more difficult to help people leave abusive partners than

all hope is not lost as long as she‚Äôs alive she can still get clean i‚Äôm sure you know this but it would be a good idea for you have narcan nasal spray on you at all times ‚Äî and especially if you know you‚Äôre going to be seeing her and see if you can get some training on how to use it if you haven‚Äôt already a lot of harm reduction places offer the narcan and the training for free and you can get narcan otc in a lot of states in the us now  good luck to you and just know you aren‚Äôt alone in this i‚Äôm rooting for you and your sister üíúi have a lot of experience with a lot of this so feel free to reach out if you have any other logistical questions also my boyfriend has used literally every drug and he‚Äôs happy to answer any logistical questions as well so feel to reach out and if i can‚Äôt answer i‚Äôll ask him   thishttpswwwpainnewsnetworkorgstories2019717asurvivalguideforopioidwithdrawalformatamp is more for opioid users but it‚Äôs a really practical and easyskimlist i wrote with my boyfriend about what to actually expect during opioid withdrawal and it might give you some insight it‚Äôs a super easy read not sure if your boyfriend used opioids based on your question about crack but sharing it just in case it includes a lot of information that doctors tend to leave outyeah i found it to be the most helpful for me and my boyfriend and i think a lot of the science is really showing the weakness in the ‚Äútough love‚Äù approach    i always say if you want to break up with partner because of their addiction definitely do so but don‚Äôt break up with your partner hoping it will fix them and the relationship don‚Äôt break up with someone struggling with addiction hoping it will help them realize how amazing your love is and then hoping that will magically make them give up drugs that doesn‚Äôt happen   i also have gone on and off prescribed pain meds over the last 7 years i have a genetic illness that causes chronic pain and i have experienced the hell of opioid withdrawal first hand so i think it probably made me more empathetic‚Äî for better or worse my boyfriend is in a really good place right now though so for us it has helped if you have any questions feel free to let me knowthat‚Äôs awesome just know that psychological symptoms can last up to two years so try to get into therapy i started having panic attacks out of nowhere about 10 days in and then the suicidal thoughts were so bad i ended up in the er a few months later  i found a great psychiatrist who specialized in opioid withdrawal and it saved my lifehello i‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with all of that i can only give you advice based on my personal experience if you‚Äôre not already seeing a professional therapist i would definitely encourage you to do so and i don‚Äôt know how much of my advice is na approved i can only tell you what has helped me and my boyfriend  for me what stood out here was that he cheated on you that‚Äôs a problem in and of itself   from there deciding whether or not you can date an addict is something people rarely ask but you need to consider it outright he will likely relapse again multiple times‚Äî even if it‚Äôs interspersed with long periods of trying to stay sober you need to realize that a relapse is not based on or indicative of how much he does or doesn‚Äôt love you and it‚Äôs a myth pushed on people that you can cure someone of addiction by showing them how much you love them and helping them realize how much they have to lose     so starting with your boundary of ‚Äúif you use again i will leave you‚Äù it probably won‚Äôt be effective decide now if you can or cannot date an addict and then go from there if you can‚Äôt you might want to consider leaving now if you can start approaching it from that perspective     i read this to my boyfriend to get his perspective and he said that something that being a drug addict teaches you very quickly is exactly where actual boundaries are and they‚Äôre usually not where people say they are basically until somebody enforces a boundary you don‚Äôt have reason to believe that they will the guide i linked talked about this but whatever boundaries you decide to create you have to stick to them or he‚Äôll know they aren‚Äôt real and he‚Äôll continue to cross them if you know that you actually will not leave this person if he used but you still want him to get sober then you need to change your strategy   so the way to deal with it is to figure out the addict‚Äôs  pressure points for example you could say if you keep doing this i know you don‚Äôt want your mom to know but i‚Äôm going to ask her to come over and sit with you or if you keep using while locking the bathroom door then i‚Äôm going to detach the door the other thing is obviously limiting his access to money as in ‚Äúif you keep doing this i‚Äôm going to open a bank account you don‚Äôt have access to‚Äù   personally my boyfriend works but i have full control over all our money my psychiatrist actually suggested helping me frame it to him like this ‚Äúin every aspect of our relationship we are equal adults ‚Äî except when it comes to your addiction in that aspect you are a child and i have to act accordingly‚Äù that way i didn‚Äôt have to feel like i was treating everything he did like i was his mom because i was just frustrated in general instead i could clearly separate when i needed to be in charge of certain things   last thing is my boyfriend does use kratom daily it takes two years for your brain to get over opioid use and kratom can help bridge that gap he also used suboxone to get off heroin so you might want to talk to your boyfriend about medication assisted withdrawal if you haven‚Äôt already  hopefully some of this helped in some way i have to tell you though that the cheating is separate from addiction and you need to think about whether you‚Äôre ok with that everyone who uses drugs doesn‚Äôt cheati completely understand what you‚Äôre going through    if you were my sister i‚Äôd recommend kratom it is a very mild opioid and you can get it over the counter and it will help a lot more than ibuprofen you may need to be 18 or 21 to buy it but perhaps your parents could get it so you try it i take it daily for eds pain in combination with prescribed opioids and other medications and it actually freaking works unlike cbd for me some people love cbd though so if you haven‚Äôt tried that i would recommend that as well ‚Äî although again you may need an adult to get it     i‚Äôm prepared to get some push back on here from people upset i‚Äôm recommending kratom and cbd to a teen but i personally know how much chronic pain sucks and how important it is to manage it kratom is mildly addictive but no more so than coffee was for me if you have any questions about kratom i‚Äôm happy to answer them i actually write for a chronic pain site and wrote this columnhttpswwwpainnewsnetworkorgstories2018917everythingilearnedaboutusingkratomforpain  about using kratom for chronic pain it‚Äôs not sponsored by any kratom company or anything i am a professional writer and i write for that site on a freelance basis    don‚Äôt let anyone dismiss your need to get your pain under control good luck    also as it so happens this is my sevenyear anniversary of dealing with debilitating chronic pain and i actually posted this status to my facebook today i live in the us so being in germany is exciting for me    status    seven years ago on the day after the super bowl i woke up with so much pain in my ribs that i went to er i spent the night in the hospital and left without any clear plan or idea of what was going on within six months i had moved to work from home for my fulltime job moved in with my mom and quit my parttime job as a youth leader eventually i was diagnosed with eds and the pain was attributed to nerve damage that was likely caused by gall bladder surgery that i‚Äôd had years before the pain started it was nerve damage that i was more susceptible to it because of the eds  the pain is still awful and the only reason i‚Äôm able to function and maintain my job is opioids without them i would have had to quit working years ago  i won‚Äôt lie chronic pain does some fucked up things to your brain i almost killed myself multiple times over those seven years     but today i woke up in germany and the love of my life was lying next to me life is full of awful things but it‚Äôs also full of amazing things keep going and if you‚Äôre in chronic pain find a doctor who believes you and is willing to treat you with every tool available    because if the choice is suicide or opioids opioids are always the better option    and anyone who thinks chronic pain wouldn‚Äôt drive them to suicide hasn‚Äôt actually been in chronic pain
,,,krazikat,opiate^china^opiates,us opiate addicts our doc before booze took over know about paws all too wellhuge accomplishment congrats  im one relapse after another  currently justifying opiate use in order to not drink so muchanother reason why i posted i never get to show off and use the fine chinaloperamide is an opiate that does not cross the bbb in typical doses however at high doses it does cross the bbb and will relieve opiate withdrawal symptoms  taking high doses of loperamide is extremely dangerousopiates give me that feeling  but when i run outbooze makes for a nice and shitty fill ini dont think anyone really knows thats why prescribe it like crazy now cause its an not opiate or a benzo  pain anxiety rls withdrawal take gabayes   but unless there is something to the distribution of the actual medicine in the pill that would be an awfully large dose of bupe  the tablet is almost the size of the popes head unless the orientation of the photo just gives that illusion   also the part about wine being replaced with methadone ‚Äì so many people making holy communion would get so sick opiate naive churchgoers are going to be sick for days  i sincerely hope this isnt true  i cant seem to find any news articles online

,,,GrapeCulture69,opioid^opiate^black^opiates^opium,there was one very inappropriately conducted study that showed that a small number of people that were regular low dosage kratom users didnt experience decreasing testosterone during the study it never had a lab from the people before they were users and it didnt explore higher level usage meanwhile every other study covering opioid use shows a decrease in twas a complete opiate addict myself kratom ended up being my drug of choice because of availability then it actually became something i relied on for the mental health aspect even on opiates actually more like especially i struggled with depression and anhedonia kratom took that all away and was way more effective than the prozac i took for a while of course that magic fades too   on the bright side once you get through kratom withdrawals you will start feeling younger and younger i went form having achey joints that cracked and popped constantly while using and in withdrawal to moving around with no pain im only in my 30s too my back pain significantly improved after quitting too that one took a while thoughi cant take nsaids so the only thing i can really do for pain is tylenolacetaminophenparacetamolapap not sure where you live so i dropped all the names but these are absolutely out of the question for you since you have liver issues my other go to is pain induction tens unit and capsicum creams they have dollar store ones for a good starting point dont start with the extra strength stuff or you will regret it induce a little pain and really reduce overall pain probably an endorphin thing but i wont pretend i know the science of it all also black seed oil might offer some pain relief but i dont know how it could affect your liver so please ask your doc before trying that one outi never noticed any rebound from supplements but gabapentin had some horrific rebounds this stuff needs to be used very carefully and its probably good you arent using it  also i havent personally experienced it but some people have complained about rebound anxiety after using high levels of kava my impression from their posts is that they were using it to catch a buzz every day and then had problems going without it they didnt seem like people using it intermittently and at low levels just for opioid withdrawalthats funny you mentioned the voice thing my voice has dropped an octive or five since quitting i talked to an ex coworker last week and one of the first things he said is that my voice sounds deeper i hadnt even thought of it before he mentioned it i think everyone is used to my having a high pitched nasally voice from opiates the nasally part is from the constant congestion from either being high or interdose withdrawalsthats really unusual and that doesnt seem like enough phenibut to affect your t like that but it might be related maybe you just need sunlight and exercise to get your system running again definitely worth getting an endothyroid panel done just to see where you are at hormonally also check out dhea supps because opioid use depletes it and its a precursor to sex hormonesanxiety cravings and anhedonia are still pretty likely sounds like you had a pretty short usage time so you arent going to experience what long term users go through you still seemed of have been pretty lucky as far as acutes go maybe something you are taking is helping out without you realizing it either way i dont think you will suddenly get hit with a wave of acutes but the withdrawals definitely arent done   there is also this weird phenomenon of an easy quit i had a few of them over my years of opioid abuse i always took them for granted and the next quit would be miserable dont take this for granted and start using again or you will for sure regret itjust wanted to remind you that you are tapering an opioid and an ssri when you taper tramadol besides the advice here you could look at the taper and withdrawal subs and other online forums about ssri cessation most commonly people talk about prozac i know how bad those suck too and there are definitely options i would suggest researching dont take without talking with your doctor please 5htp as it is a weak and natural ssri and you can potentially replace the tramadol with that over time two warnings though you have to taper off of 5htp too at some point and you risk serotonin syndrome if you take it while still taking tramadol this is a genuine risk and why i mentioned talking with your doctor   i wouldnt have even brought up ssris or replacements like 5htp if you hadnt been on tramadol so damn long your paws could potentially be drawn out and abnormally difficult not trying to scare you but i didnt want you getting caught off guard with the feelingsim posting since there werent too many answers but i can only compare kratom with oxy hydrocodone and opium   kratom is the worst withdrawal for me personally because of the psych meds in kratom the physical part is relatively mild while the anhedonia depression and anxiety are through the roof the physical withdrawals of oxy are the most sharp and intense and the physicals of opium are crazy because of how long they drag on for and what it does to my heart they feel like a month long heart attack and the diarrhea is the worst possible hydrocodone is a mix of all the above but is actually easy to taper for some reason  kratom will be like a mixture of a really light heroin habit and a moderate to severe prozac usage level thats how it was to me personally to back some of this up i experience kratom withdrawals even when high on opiates so i know im not dealing exclusively with an opioid withdrawal with kratomthank you for the kind words how did the surgery go   so my initial pain after surgery was very intense im certain my tolerance is permanently increased took probably double the post op recovery meds it would have for an opiate naive person and even worse is i got all of the bad opiate side effects from them nausea dizziness slurred speech etc and no euphoria about 6 hours post op and i was feeling okay the 5mg norco didnt take all the pain away but it made a huge difference with getting comfortable and getting some sleep   i learned a little trick that might help you ifwhen the pain meds arent helping or available instead of trying to avoid and distract myself from the pain i focused on it and let myself feel it at first it was worse but eventually it made the pain go way downloperamide taper will help caffeine for energy and the lope will combat the increased diarrhea that stimulants like caffeineenergy drinks will cause during withdrawal plus the lope is an opioid and will reduce your wd symptoms anyway start at 16mg 32mg would be the max and is basically a prescription level of usage and taper down to 0 over 8 days seems to work well for most people

,,,xxlilituxx,chocolate,ok my husband and i are into age play both in our sexual relationship and in our day to day relationship i like it when after a hugely stressful day i can put on a nightie and some cute plain white panties and drink chocolate milk and watch cartoons octonauts is my favourite while sitting in my husbands lap it is about caring and being cared for in those times i am completely dependent on him to make all of my decisions for me   in a sexual context it is still about being dependent for my husband it is about someone wanting him to teach them about sex not about me being a child but about me having no knowledge about sex and my body and how it all works and why things feel good for example if he starts caressing my labia through my panties i can say daddy why does that make me feel all tingly inside it feels really good   now i need to reiterate that my husband and i are both in our 30s and have absolutely zero interest in children whether its sexual or social or in a parental sense this is a relationship between two people who both gain something incredible from the dynamic   also there is a big size difference between my husband and i he is 63 and 105kg 230lb i am 51 and 45kg 99lb so it is easy for us to play around with that dynamic daddy you are so big i dont think that i can put that in my mouth i will choke    if there is anything specific you want me to explain feel free to ask
,,,imthesock,china,when i insulted you it was at 3am i was tired and in a bad mood im sorry i do that sometimes the thing i dont get is that the media clearly has a history of blowing things out of proportion like deadly storm warning then a few gusts go by the media seems to thrive on panic and hysteria that seems to be what sells so how can one then believe that the virus is even worse than what they have been told   also i dont blame people for this but i feel like alot of people on this sub actually want this virus to be big kind of like getting to sit back at home and watch a real disaster happen from the saftey of their tvpc screens so then those people naturally spread pictures of a dead person lying in the streets of china and claim to know for certainty that the media is lying to themyea noone knows what is going on inside china but if you look what is happening in other countries you can start to paint a clear picture and there have been zero reported deaths outside china just a single death would cause headlines because that would show that the disease can spread and everyone is in danger but that has not happened even though alot of people fled wuhan over a month ago this disease has had the chance to spread but obviously it is not a threatlisten to yourself anyone who disagrees with your conspiracy theory is some sort of planted agent trying to brain wash you how many deaths have there been outside of china or is every country in on your conspiricy perhaps the global illumaniti have formed a plan to cleanse the globe of the inpure and can control the media and leaders of every single country  i am based in thailand where apparently alot of people from wuhan fled to noone here has died there are no dead bodies lining the streets im sorry this isnt going to be a thing what reality was it i needed to wake up to    that is just literally a photo of two dead bodies lying in the street with absolutely no context also alot of people are crowded around to gawk which tells us this isnt a common sight how does that somehow prove that there is a huge deadly pandemic sweeping the globe i guess if you blindly believed the media who have a clear incentive to write sensational fear mongering articles   maybe if you should stop and consider that noone has died outside of china zero peoplewow you are delusional    yes we know the chinese are hiding the deaths no you dont know that china is hiding deaths this is just a conspiracy theory that is just as likely to be false and what about other countries are they hiding deaths too or is it just cold hard fact that zero people have died outside of china pretty low numbers for a pandemic i must say  also thailand already started curing patients im sorry but your doomsday fantasies are officially over time to wake up to reality dudebecause i dont believe that there is some huge global conspiracy to down play this virus i take the virus at face value something that has killed zero people outside of china if you act and think rationally actually look at the confirmed death toll you too will see that prepping for a pandemic is completely over reacting  x200b  i mean once this virus has run its course a few hundred people maybe a thousand will be dead meanwhile tens of thousands will have perished from normal pneumonia wouldnt it make more sense to get all worked up over pneumonia instead  x200b  edit aaand its been cured already
